At this time this writer can identify at three major existential threats to humanity: (i) large-scale thermonuclear war followed by a nuclear winter, (ii) a planet killing asteroid impact and (iii) infectious disease. To this trio might be added climate change making the planet uninhabitable. Of the three existential threats the first is deduced from the inferred cataclysmic effects of nuclear war. For the second there is geological evidence for the association of asteroid impacts with massive extinction (Alvarez, 1987). As to an existential threat from microbes recent decades have provided unequivocal evidence for the ability of certain pathogens to cause the extinction of entire species. Although infectious disease has traditionally not been associated with extinction this view has changed by the finding that a single chytrid fungus was responsible for the extinction of numerous amphibian species (Daszak et al., 1999; Mendelson et al., 2006). Previously, the view that infectious diseases were not a cause of extinction was predicated on the notion that many pathogens required their hosts and that some proportion of the host population was naturally resistant. However, that calculation does not apply to microbes that are acquired directly from the environment and have no need for a host, such as the majority of fungal pathogens. For those types of host–microbe interactions it is possible for the pathogen to kill off every last member of a species without harm to itself, since it would return to its natural habitat upon killing its last host. Hence, from the viewpoint of existential threats environmental microbes could potentially pose a much greater threat to humanity than the known pathogenic microbes, which number somewhere near 1500 species (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001), especially if some of these species acquired the capacity for pathogenicity as a consequence of natural evolution or bioengineering.",2089.0,"<h4>Extinction </h4><p>Arturo <strong>Casadevall 12</strong>, M.D., Ph.D. in Biochemistry from New York University, Leo and Julia Forchheimer Professor and Chair of the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, former editor of the ASM journal Infection and Immunity, “The future of biological warfare,” Microbial Biotechnology Volume 5, Issue 5, pages 584–587, September 2012, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1751-7915.2012.00340.x/full</p><p>In considering the importance of biological warfare as a subject for concern <u><strong>it is worthwhile to review the known existential threats</u></strong>.

Indeed, there has not been a single instance over the past twelve years of a terrorist organization exploding a primitive bomb on American soil, much less striking a major blow.

For decades, trade commentary has implicitly embraced the ""bicycle theory"" - the belief that unless multilateral trade liberalization moves ahead, the entire global trade regime will collapse because of a lack of forward momentum. The last decade -- and particularly the post-2008 period -- suggests that there are limits to that rule of thumb.

In Washington v. Glucksberg n1 and Vacco v. Quill n2 the Supreme Court Justices did the right thing by rejecting a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide (PAS) or euthanasia. n3 They also reached the correct decision in not foreclosing state legalization of these interventions. The decisions will foster a lively debate in the states about the ethics and political prudence of permitting these interventions. Although a few Justices held out hope for a more narrow constitutional right to PAS or euthanasia, the majority holdings permanently shifted the forum, the arguments, the perspective, and the justifications in the debate over PAS and euthanasia. The forum is no longer the courts, but the legislatures and public squares. The arguments are no longer about constitutional rights, but ethics and prudent policies. The perspective is no longer first person, but third per- [*984] son. And the justifications no longer appeal to individual autonomy and beneficence, but to probable social goods and harms. This is as it should be in a democracy. As the debate proceeds, however, it must be better informed. The debate needs to move away from this or that heart-wrenching case calling out for euthanasia, shake off the distortions concerning end-of-life practices that have so far informed it, and carefully examine what likely benefits and harms might result from legalization. This means that there will be even more emphasis on accurate empirical assessments of likely practices and consequences related to PAS or euthanasia.

A candidate can win this race with as little as 33 percent. There is no runoff — it's just a simple plurality. And there is even a fourth candidate, Gordon Howie.

Rose finds that pairs of states belonging to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the WTO, do not have higher trade levels than nonmember dyads. Prior to Rose’s research, the GATT and WTO were commonly perceived as significant institutions in expanding global trade. The WTO aims to promote trade, and the protestors who have attempted to disrupt every WTO ministerial meeting since 1999 in Seattle must think it promotes trade. National governments also seem to think that the WTO promotes trade, or else it is difficult to understand why they spend so much time and effort negotiating new agreements. So, what explains Rose’s counterintuitive finding? The GATT/WTO is supposed to increase trade by reducing tariffs. We argue, however, that tariffs are only one factor affecting trade flows, and often a relatively minor one. Market-protecting institutions (MPIs), which are domestic institutions that protect market activity, exert a considerable influence on international trade (Anderson and Marcouiller 2002; Anderson and van Wincoop 2004; Berkowitz, Moenius and Pistor 2006; Iwanow and Kirkpatrick 2007; Nunn 2007; Ranjan and Lee 2007). MPIs promote trade by reducing transaction costs, and because high transaction costs can prohibit trade, we argue that the relationship between GATT/WTO membership and dyadic trade is conditional on the strength of MPIs in the dyad. When MPIs are strongly developed, trade is able to flow relatively freely and GATT/WTO tariff reductions further increase trade; thus, dyads with strong MPIs are likely to see an increase in trade upon GATT/WTO accession. On the other hand, in dyads with weak MPIs, GATT/WTO membership is unlikely to promote trade because the marginally lower tariffs provided by GATT/WTO membership are unable to offset the high transaction costs associated with weak MPIs.

Adelson's political advisor Abboud says the senator's allegiance has nothing to do with the big checks he's gotten from the billionaire.

""There's no connection between financial support for Lindsey Graham and the bill sponsorship."" Still, Adelson and his team have made it clear — they will spare no expense in this fight. Last year, Adelson spent $320,000 lobbying, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That's just a speck of dust for the casino magnate, and his opponents know it.

While this report's advocacy may lead to some net gain, underlying problems will remain unsolved and efforts that further the legalization of marijuana may result in an inefficient use of political capital.  Viewing the report in this manner reveals that marijuana legalization is an indirect way to address racial disparities in arrest and incarceration rates.  There may be a benefit to this policy: the report details the high number of arrests of African Americans due to marijuana-related crimes, and arrests for these crimes would not occur if  these crimes were eliminated.  On the other hand, the legalization of marijuana would do nothing to address racial profiling by police, which is the real reason for the disparity in arrests and incarceration that prompted this report.  The political capital that would need to be spent on advancing the controversial policy of marijuana legalization could be better spent elsewhere, namely on statutes and ordinances that go beyond the limited protections provided by the Fourth Amendment and prohibit the use of race in forming probable cause or reasonable suspicion.  These statutes would have the benefits of directly addressing the problem and would apply to all prosecutions, not just prosecutions for marijuana-related crimes.  This alternate approach may also be perceived as less controversial than marijuana legalization and would be a good initial step towards trying to solve the problem.  Statutes barring race-based searches and seizures would likely run into problems if the marijuana legislation suggested by the ACLU were passed: detractors of the search and seizure statutes could argue that the problem has been solved by the marijuana legislation, or that advocates of new policies would at least need to wait and see the effects of the marijuana legislation before they could make convincing empirical arguments.",1982.0,"<h4>Legalization drains political capital on other issues -- also prevents structural reforms -- link independently turns case </h4><p>Michael <strong>Smith 13</strong>, 6-5-2013 ""Michael Smith's Law Blog: Marijuana Legalization, Racial Disparity, and Interest Convergence,"" http://smithblawg.blogspot.com/2013/06/marijuana-legalization-racial-disparity.html, AB</p><p>My argument is that <u><strong>the ACLU's report seems to be a paradigmatic example of interest convergence</u></strong>.  <u><strong><mark>While this</u></strong></mark> report's <u><strong><mark>advocacy may lead to some net gain</u></strong>, <u><strong>underlying problems will remain unsolved</u></strong></mark> <u><strong><mark>and</u></strong> <u><strong>efforts that further the legalization of marijuana</u></strong></mark> may <u><strong><mark>result in an inefficient use of political capital</u></strong></mark>.

Institutional characteristics underlying these three patterns were analyzed, testing the hypothesis that forest cover change is a function of strength and enforcement of local social institutions. The results showed a minor decrease of 7% total forest cover in the study area during the whole period 1984–2000, but an overall net increase of 4% during the period 1993–2000. The highest loss of forest cover occurred in a low human population density area with long distances to markets, while a stable forest cover occurred in the area with highest population density and good market access. Analyses of institutions revealed that loss of forest cover occurred mainly in areas characterized by insecure property rights, while areas with well-defined property rights showed either regenerating or stable forest cover. The results thus corroborate our hypothesis. The large-scale spontaneous regeneration dominated by native endemic species appears to be a result of a combination of changes in precipitation, migration and decreased human population and livestock grazing pressure, but under conditions of maintained and well-defined property rights. Our study emphasizes the large capacity of a semi-arid system to spontaneously regenerate, triggered by decreased pressures, but where existing social institutions mitigate other drivers of deforestation and alternative land-use.",1970.0,"<h4>Regeneration solves </h4><p><strong>Tengo 07</strong> (Thomas Elmqvist (Department of Systems Ecology at Stolkholm University).

The US has recorded a sharp fall in its greenhouse gas emissions from energy use. Thanks to a rise in the use of natural gas, emissions are at their lowest since 1992. The fall will boost the natural gas industry, but in reality the emissions have simply been exported.¶ According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), energy-related CO2 emissions in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest in two decades. Emissions are normally high between January and March because people use more heating in the winter, but last winter was mild in the US.¶ The EIA says that an increase in gas-fired power generation, and a corresponding decline in coal-fired, contributed to the fall in emissions. Burning natural gas produces fewer emissions than burning coal, and natural gas is currently unusually cheap in the US thanks to a glut of shale gas extracted by hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"".¶ If gas companies continue to expand their shale gas operations, the US could generate even more electricity from gas, and its emissions could fall for several years, says Kevin Anderson of the University of Manchester, UK.¶ However, this will not slow down climate change. US coal consumption has fallen, but production is holding steady and the surplus is being sold to Asia. As a result, the US is effectively exporting the coal-related emissions.¶ ""Gas is less bad than burning the coal, but only if you keep the coal in the ground,"" Anderson says.¶ Proponents of natural gas argue that it is a ""transition fuel"" that we can burn for a few years while we install low-carbon infrastructure such as wind farms and nuclear power stations.¶ That viewpoint looks increasingly untenable. ""If we want even an outside chance of [limiting global warming to] 2 °C, there is no emission space for gas,"" Anderson says.

The Nevada regulations result not only in a system that reinforces the stigmatization of prostitutes and denies them their most basic rights, but also creates a working environment and conditions that are so unattractive that legal brothels are hard pressed to find women who will work in them. It is for good reason that prostitutes in general prefer to work in illegal venues. Nevada’s policies altogether disfranchise prostitutes as citizens and rights holders, violate them as workers and persons, and promote dangerous client expectations, all in order to control the “victimizing” prostitute. Nowhere is the importance of conceptual constructs to the construction of policy more evident. Systems of legalization not only promote such representations of prostitutes but carry along, on this tide of misogynistic control, a correlating contempt for non-prostitute women. In Nevada, various unwritten rules circumscribe the behavior of non-prostitute women. As Pillard Notes: One of the most curious unwritten rules is that [in Winnemucca] no non-establishment female can visit any of the brothels or even drive through the area.

Apparently there is some concern that an angry wife could drive through the Line [a public road] looking for her husband’s car.

As of June 18, NATO turned over to the Afghans the security lead for 100 percent of the country, and US and NATO troops officially shifted to an advise-and-assist role throughout Afghanistan – a role set to draw to a close with the end of NATO's combat mission in December 2014. Evidence is mixed as to the readiness of Afghanistan's Army soldiers and National Police to assume the lead in planning and fighting the war – with the summer combat season likely to be the first big test. There's been progress, to be sure. Most of the Afghan Army brigades – as many as 20 of 26, NATO officials claim – are capable of working on their own, up from one a year ago. And the Afghan people are becoming more confident in the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), polls show. ""The people are getting more confident, and part of that is what they have seen from the ANSF"" in the initial weeks of the summer fighting season, says Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, chairman of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program.

The Nevada regulations result not only in a system that reinforces the stigmatization of prostitutes and denies them their most basic rights, but also creates a working environment and conditions that are so unattractive that legal brothels are hard pressed to find women who will work in them. It is for good reason that prostitutes in general prefer to work in illegal venues. Nevada’s policies altogether disfranchise prostitutes as citizens and rights holders, violate them as workers and persons, and promote dangerous client expectations, all in order to control the “victimizing” prostitute. Nowhere is the importance of conceptual constructs to the construction of policy more evident. Systems of legalization not only promote such representations of prostitutes but carry along, on this tide of misogynistic control, a correlating contempt for non-prostitute women. In Nevada, various unwritten rules circumscribe the behavior of non-prostitute women. As Pillard Notes: One of the most curious unwritten rules is that [in Winnemucca] no non-establishment female can visit any of the brothels or even drive through the area. [Winnemucca] police chief [Lee] Jones told in an interview that this rule was enforced to protect customers of these brothels. Apparently there is some concern that an angry wife could drive through the Line [a public road] looking for her husband’s car.

Thus, when we write about <u>settler colonialism</u> in this article, we are writing about it as <u>[is] both an historical <strong>and</u></strong> <u>contemporary matrix of relations and conditions that define life in the settler colonial nation-state</u>, <u>such as the <strong>U</u></strong>nited <u><strong>S</u></strong>tates, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, South Africa, Chinese Tibet, and others. <u>In North America, settler colonialism operates through a triad of relationships, between the</u> (white [but not always]) <u>settlers, the Indigenous inhabitants, and chattel slaves who are removed from their homelands to work stolen land</u>. <u><strong><mark>At the crux of these relationships is land</u></strong></mark>, highly valued and disputed. <u><mark>For settlers to live on and profit from land, they must eliminate Indigenous peoples, and <strong>extinguish their historical, epistemological, philosophical, moral and political claims to land</u></strong>. <u><strong>Land, in being settled, becomes property</strong></mark>. Settlers must also import chattel slaves, who must be kept landless, and who also become property, to be <strong>used, abused, and managed.</p></u></strong>",1NC,,Off,76262,55,17009,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/EvZo/Baylor-Evans-Zoda-Neg-USC-Round2.docx,564719,N,USC,2,ASU CaRe,Ralph Paone,"1ac was online gambling decolonization

The double humiliation of protest in the mainstream media, making it both silly and dangerous, subtracts personhood from activists, making their very gestures of citizenship seem proof that their claims arc illegitimate. This is especially germane in the portrayal of pro-life and gay collective actions. In contrast, political suffering is still palatable when expressed as a trauma or injury to a particular person. This narrowing in the means for making a legitimate claim on public sympathy has had a significant effect in a certain strain of U.S. legal theory, where some are arguing that words and images can produce harms to a person as substantial as those made by physical acts of violence, such that violent and cruel talk should be actionable the way physical assault is (Matsuda 1993).  But more than this, talk shows and other forms of gossip media have helped to make scenes of personal witnessing the only political testimony that counts.  It is not that just everybody loves a good sob story.  Trauma makes good storytelling and, as journalistic common sense constantly reminds us, it puts a ""face"" on an otherwise abstract issue.17 Moreover, the sheer scale of the systematically brutal hierarchies that structure national capitalist culture can be overwhelming, leading to a kind of emotional and analytic paralysis [stagnation] in a public that cannot imagine a world without poverty or violence: here too, the facialization of U.S. injustice makes it manageable and enables further deferral of considerations that might force structural transformations of public life.

Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout most of the Cold War, secondary to improving military capabilities. Climate change could meet a similar fate. An essentially political problem concerning the distribution of the costs of prevention and adaptation and the losses and gains in income arising from change in the human environment might be perceived as intractable, thus necessitating the build-up of military and police forces to prevent it from becoming a major security problem. The portrayal of climate change as a security problem could, in particular, cause the richer countries in the global North, which are less affected by it, to strengthen measures aimed at protecting them from the spillover of violent conflict from the poorer countries in the global South that will be most affected by climate change.

WHY WE SHOULD NOT PAY FOR HUMAN ORGANS         Ebsco
Although class distinctions are an almost naturalized part of social life in all complex societies, in this particular instance the exploitation of organ sellers veers dangerously close to human slavery, as argued by Giovanni Berlinguer (Berlinguer and Garrafa 1996). The pressures put by organ brokers upon the desperation of the world’s dislocated, refugee, and poorest populations to provide the scarce commodities reveals the limits of argu- ments based solely on individual autonomy. Yes, even the poorest people of the world “make choices,” but they do not make these freely or under social or economic conditions of their own making. Further, the pressure of organ brokers upon the poor makes their decision to sell an organ anything but a free and autonomous choice. These secular arguments reach a conclusion similar to one derived from Christian morality—that the sale of human organs is unethical. The most disturbing issue of organ sales to both Christian and secular ethicists is the formation of an economic underclass of organ donors throughout the world to serve the wealthy. This is not to suggest that proponents of organ sales are in favor of exploiting the poor but, rather, that they are indifferent to the social and individual pathologies that markets in kidneys and other body parts produce, such as the documented evidence of postsurgery medical complications, chronic pain, psychological problems, unemployment, decreased earning power, social ostracism, and social stigma faced by kidney sellers in many parts of the world (see Zargooshi 2002; Jimenez and Scheper-Hughes 2002a; Ram 2002).",1963.0,"<h4><strong>The illicit market exploits in a way like slavery</h4><p>Delmonico 3    </strong>Francis L.

In a truly ironic twist of logic, some opponents of the use of financial incentives for cadaveric organ donors have cited various human rights abuses and extraordinarily high prices associated with such black market activities as har-bingers of the sorts of outcomes likely to accompany legalized organ markets. n32 This line of ""reasoning"" is equivalent to arguing that legalization of liquor sales would lead to the sorts of mafia-related activities that arose during prohibi-tion. This argument stands accepted economic theory on its head. The truth is that the types of behavior and price levels that frequently accompany black market sales tend to disappear when trade is legalized. Legalized trade allows the market price to fall as legitimate businesses enter the market and increase supply. Moreover, costs decrease as the risks of both prosecution and violent actions by rival producers are eliminated.

on reasonable medical grounds, transplantation is the best therapy, and sometimes the only good therapy, for a variety of serious conditions,","Some critics of modern medicine and its orientation toward extending life beyond ""natural"" limits, such as Nancy Scheper-Hughcs (2004), regard the entire idea of an organ shortage as a contrivance of modern medical practice. It is not the purpose of this work to address such claims. For our purposes, a shortage exists if there is an increase in the waiting list, appropriately adjusted for deaths, sickness, and the like. Thus, by necessity, we will ignore most speculation concerning the numbers of persons who, on strictly medical grounds of some sort, might benefit from a transplant. This latter number will always exceed the active waiting lists, perhaps by a large margin. Some opponents of market-based reforms in organ procurement have claimed that any increase in available organs will only trigger a flood of additional registrations, as physicians begin listing their patients under weaker and weaker criteria.Yet, even if abundant numbers of good organs were available for free, transplantation would remain an expensive procedure in absolute terms, so it will likely never be the case that transplants will be generally done on very thin grounds. In most or all industrialized countries, the general consensus is that those on waiting lists are, in virtually all cases, persons who would, in fact, benefit from a transplant in a meaningful and substantial way.
Thus, it seems quite fair to say that a global organ shortage does indeed exist. Although our conceptualization of this shortage means that we will pay too much attention to economically advanced countries, it must be empha¬sized that many middle- and lower-income nations would have shortages, as we define them, had they the resources.That is, on reasonable medical grounds, transplantation is the best therapy, and sometimes the only good therapy, for a variety of serious conditions, and these conditions are, unfortunately, prevalent throughout much of the world.

Probabilities below the threshold are treated as though they were zero","On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)

Another complication for legalization is international law. While many researchers attempt to make international comparisons in studying drugs, one area of drug control policy that receives scant attention is the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 which binds all UN member nations to maintain prohibition of drugs, including cannabis specifically (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 61). While the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires that countries maintain prohibition of manufacture, sales, and import, it does not require a punitive regime of the type currently found in the United States. Article 36 of the Single Convention, “Penal Provision,” specifically allows for treatment programs to either enhance or serve as a substitute for punishment.81 The Economist reports that countries like the Netherlands are able to allow for some innovation in controlling marijuana use through the convention’s commentary, which states that its goal is “improvement of the efficacy of national criminal justice systems in the field of drug trafficking” (“A Toker’s Guide” 2009). Thus, reforms working within the framework of the existing treaty are possible, though full- scale legalization would require either a country’s withdrawal from the treaty or revision thereof. Perhaps partly due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, even countries with more liberal narcotics policies than the United States lack full- fledged drug legalization and at most allow for depenalization of marijuana and/ or widespread needle exchange programs. As discussed above, in the Netherlands, a country long known for its tolerance of marijuana smoking, the importation and commercial production of cannabis remains illegal (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 64).

WHY WE SHOULD NOT PAY FOR HUMAN ORGANS         Ebsco
Although class distinctions are an almost naturalized part of social life in all complex societies, in this particular instance the exploitation of organ sellers veers dangerously close to human slavery, as argued by Giovanni Berlinguer (Berlinguer and Garrafa 1996). The pressures put by organ brokers upon the desperation of the world’s dislocated, refugee, and poorest populations to provide the scarce commodities reveals the limits of argu- ments based solely on individual autonomy. Yes, even the poorest people of the world “make choices,” but they do not make these freely or under social or economic conditions of their own making. Further, the pressure of organ brokers upon the poor makes their decision to sell an organ anything but a free and autonomous choice. These secular arguments reach a conclusion similar to one derived from Christian morality—that the sale of human organs is unethical. The most disturbing issue of organ sales to both Christian and secular ethicists is the formation of an economic underclass of organ donors throughout the world to serve the wealthy. This is not to suggest that proponents of organ sales are in favor of exploiting the poor but, rather, that they are indifferent to the social and individual pathologies that markets in kidneys and other body parts produce, such as the documented evidence of postsurgery medical complications, chronic pain, psychological problems, unemployment, decreased earning power, social ostracism, and social stigma faced by kidney sellers in many parts of the world (see Zargooshi 2002; Jimenez and Scheper-Hughes 2002a; Ram 2002).",1963.0,"<h4><strong>The illicit market exploits in a way like slavery</h4><p>Delmonico 3    </strong>Francis L.

Probabilities below the threshold are treated as though they were zero","On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)  When something is about as probable as a thousand fair dice when tossed a thousand times coming up all sixes, then, so it is held, we can pretty well forget about it as a worthy of concern.  As a matter of practical policy, we operate with probabilities on the principle that when x ≤ E, then x = 0.  We take the line that in our human dealings in real-life situations a sufficiently remote possibility can—for all sensible purposes—be viewed as being of probability zero.  Accordingly, such remote possibilities can simply be dismissed, and the outcomes with which they are associated can accordingly be set aside.  And in “the real world” people do in fact seem to be prepared to treat certain probabilities as effectively zero, taking certain sufficiently improbable eventualities as no long representing real possibilities.

The CLS critique of piecemeal reform¶ Critical scholars reject the idea of piecemeal reform. Incremental change, they argue, merely postpones the wholesale reformation that must occur to create a decent society. Even worse, an unfair social system survives by using piecemeal reform to disguise and legitimize oppression. Those who control the system weaken resistance by pointing to the occasional concession to, or periodic court victory of, a black plaintiff or worker as evidence that the system is fair and¶ just. In fact, Crits believe that teaching the¶ common law or using the case method in law school is a disguised means of preaching incrementalism and thereby maintaining the current power structure.“ To avoid this, CLS scholars¶ urge law professors to abandon the case method, give up the effort to ﬁnd rationality and order¶ in the case law, and teach in an unabashedly political fashion.¶ The CLS critique of piecemeal reform is familiar, imperialistic and wrong. Minorities know from bitter experience that occasional court victories do not mean the Promised Land is at hand. The critique is imperialistic in that it tells minorities and other oppressed peoples how they should interpret events affecting them.

Another complication for legalization is international law. While many researchers attempt to make international comparisons in studying drugs, one area of drug control policy that receives scant attention is the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 which binds all UN member nations to maintain prohibition of drugs, including cannabis specifically (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 61). While the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires that countries maintain prohibition of manufacture, sales, and import, it does not require a punitive regime of the type currently found in the United States. Article 36 of the Single Convention, “Penal Provision,” specifically allows for treatment programs to either enhance or serve as a substitute for punishment.81 The Economist reports that countries like the Netherlands are able to allow for some innovation in controlling marijuana use through the convention’s commentary, which states that its goal is “improvement of the efficacy of national criminal justice systems in the field of drug trafficking” (“A Toker’s Guide” 2009). Thus, reforms working within the framework of the existing treaty are possible, though full- scale legalization would require either a country’s withdrawal from the treaty or revision thereof. Perhaps partly due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, even countries with more liberal narcotics policies than the United States lack full- fledged drug legalization and at most allow for depenalization of marijuana and/ or widespread needle exchange programs. As discussed above, in the Netherlands, a country long known for its tolerance of marijuana smoking, the importation and commercial production of cannabis remains illegal (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 64).

WASHINGTON – A massive, countrywide power failure like the one in India on Tuesday is ""extremely unlikely"" in the United States, energy experts say.
In India, three of the country's government-operated power grids failed Tuesday, leaving 620 million people without electricity for several hours. The outage, the second in two days in the country of 1.21 billion people, is the world's biggest blackout on record.
