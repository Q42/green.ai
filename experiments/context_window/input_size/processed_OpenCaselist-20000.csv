MEXICO CITY — For the past seven years, Mexico and the United States have put aside their tension-filled history on security matters to forge an unparalleled alliance against Mexico’s drug cartels, one based on sharing sensitive intelligence, U.S. training and joint operational planning. But now, much of that hard-earned cooperation may be in jeopardy. The December inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieto brought the nationalistic Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) back to power after 13 years, and with it a whiff of resentment over the deep U.S. involvement in Mexico’s fight against narco-traffickers. The new administration has shifted priorities away from the U.S.-backed strategy of arresting kingpins, which sparked an unprecedented level of violence among the cartels, and toward an emphasis on prevention and keeping Mexico’s streets safe and calm, Mexican authorities said. Some U.S. officials fear the coming of an unofficial truce with cartel leaders. The Mexicans see it otherwise. “The objective of fighting organized crime is not in conflict with achieving peace,” said Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico’s ambassador to the United States. Drugs and homicides in Mexico. Interviews with more than four dozen current and former U.S. and Mexican diplomats, law enforcement agents, military officers and intelligence officials — most of whom agreed to speak about sensitive matters only on condition of anonymity — paint the most detailed public portrait to date of how the two countries grew so close after so many years of distance and distrust, and what is at stake should the alliance be scaled back. U.S. officials got their first inkling that the relationship might change just two weeks after Peña Nieto assumed office Dec. 1. At the U.S. ambassador’s request, the new president sent his top five security officials to an unusual meeting at the U.S. Embassy here. In a crowded conference room, the new attorney general and interior minister sat in silence, not knowing what to expect, next to the new leaders of the army, navy and Mexican intelligence agency. In front of them at the Dec. 15 meeting were representatives from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the CIA, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other U.S. agencies tasked with helping Mexico destroy the drug cartels that had besieged the country for the past decade. The Mexicans remained stone-faced as they learned for the first time just how entwined the two countries had become during the battle against narco-traffickers, and how, in the process, the United States had been given near-complete entree to Mexico’s territory and the secrets of its citizens, according to several U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. The administration of former president Felipe Calderon had granted high-flying U.S. spy planes access to Mexican airspace for the purpose of gathering intelligence. Unarmed Customs and Border Protection drones had flown from bases in the United States in support of Mexican military and federal police raids against drug targets and to track movements that would establish suspects’ “patterns of life.” The United States had also provided electronic signals technology, ground sensors, voice-recognition gear, cellphone-tracking devices, data analysis tools, computer hacking kits and airborne cameras that could read license plates from three miles away. Under a classified program code-named SCENIC, the CIA was training Mexicans in how to target and vet potential assets for recruitment and how to guard against infiltration by narco-traffickers. In deference to their visitors, the U.S. briefers left out the fact that most of the 25 kingpin taken off the streets in the past five years had been removed because of U.S.-supplied information, often including the location of top cartel members in real time, according to people familiar with the meeting. The CIA and Calderon declined to comment for this article. Also unremarked upon was the mounting criticism that success against the cartels’ leadership had helped incite more violence than anyone had predicted, more than 60,000 deaths and 25,000 disappearances in the past seven years alone. Meanwhile, the drug flow into the United States continued unabated. Mexico remains the U.S. market’s largest supplier of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and the transshipment point for 95 percent of its cocaine. No one had come up with a quick, realistic alternative to Calderon’s novel use of the Mexican military with U.S. support. But stopping the cartel violence had become Peña Nieto’s top priority during the campaign. The U.S. administration didn’t know what that meant. Some feared a scaling back of the bilateral efforts and a willingness to trade the relentless drive against cartel leaders for calmer streets. When the Dec. 15 meeting concluded, Mexico’s new security officials remained poker-faced, “They said they were very appreciative to have received so much information,” said one U.S. official familiar with the meeting. We will be in touch, they added, and left.
The roots of cooperation U.S. involvement in Mexico’s deteriorating internal security first peaked in the mid-1980s when the cocaine epidemic in the United States turned the southern neighbor into a prosperous distribution route north. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive instructing U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to help defeat the growing narco-trafficking menace worldwide. Beginning in the late 1980s, a massive U.S. air, sea and land effort was shutting down many Caribbean drug routes. The traffickers were increasingly forced to move their product through the only territory left unhindered: Mexico. Mexico’s secret security ties with the United States date at least to the Cold War, when Mexico City was a hub of intrigue, the “Beirut of the Western Hemisphere,” according to intelligence history scholar Sergio Aguayo. To keep an eye on the United States, the Soviet Union and China had their largest embassies here, necessitating a large CIA presence. Back then, the Mexican intelligence service, CISEN, “was basically run by the CIA,” according to one former CISEN official. Although that has changed with time, the unusually close relationship between Mexican presidents and CIA chiefs has not. Then-CIA director David H. Petraeus attended a party at the Mexican Embassy in Washington in 2011 and visited Calderon in Mexico last year. As many of his predecessors had done, Calderon usually met with the CIA director when he came to Washington. The CIA’s importance here can be explained, in part, by the historically strained dealings between Mexico and the DEA and U.S. military. “There was a void that the CIA stepped into,” said Jeffrey S. Davidow, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and author of a book about the prickly relationship between the two countries. In the mid-1980s, the DEA had been virtually banished from the country because of its aggressive pursuit of a slain DEA agent’s killers. But that relationship has improved greatly in the past five years. Now, the DEA has more employees in Mexico than in any other of its 67 foreign posts. In 2000, a political earthquake in Mexico paved the way for a less suspicious era between the two neighbors. The 71-year political reign of the authoritarian and corrupt PRI ended with the election of Vicente Fox of the National Action Party as president. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States turned the new openness into unprecedented bilateral action against terrorism. The two countries fortified the border with personnel and surveillance technology. Eventually, a protocol was worked out for Mexico to stop, detain and interrogate non-Mexicans traveling north toward the United States. Mexican authorities allow U.S. officials to remotely question third-country nationals of concern to the United States, according to Mexican and U.S. officials. Clamping down on illegal border crossings, however, had an unintended consequence: It upset agreements among the cartels over smuggling routes, sparking yet more violent competition. By the time Calderon was inaugurated in late 2006, many experts believed that Mexico was losing control of parts of the country. Even before his inauguration, Calderon pleaded with President George W. Bush to help the Mexican military quash the cartels, according to Antonio Garza, then U.S. ambassador to Mexico, who attended a meeting between the presidents. Bush agreed to help, and the Merida Initiative, a $1.9 billion aid package for military training and equipment and judicial reform, set the framework for a new level of U.S.-Mexican cooperation. In a little-noticed move, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence took a leading role in the U.S. effort to defeat the cartels, signaling the importance of intelligence in combating organized crime. By then, cartels had begun employing assassination squads, according to Guillermo Valdes, who was CISEN director at the time. CISEN discovered from a captured videotape and a special analytical group it set up that some of the cartels had hired former members of the U.S.-trained Guatemalan special forces, the Kaibiles, to create sociopathic killers who could behead a man, torture a child or immerse a captive in a vat of acid. Anxious to counterattack, the CIA proposed electronically emptying the bank accounts of drug kingpins, but was turned down by the Treasury Department and the White House, which feared unleashing chaos in the banking system. As the Mexican death toll mounted, Calderon pleaded with Bush for armed drones. He had been impressed by the results in Iraq and Afghanistan, two former U.S. officials said. The White House considered the request, but quickly rejected it. It was far too likely to result in collateral damage, they said. Violence deepened ties By 2009, President Obama’s first year in office, horrific scenes had become commonplace throughout Mexico: severed heads thrown onto a dance floor, a half-dozen bodies hanged from a bridge, bombs embedded in cadavers. Ciudad Juarez, a stone’s throw from El Paso, was a virtual killing zone. Obama approved an intensification of bilateral measures. Deputy national security adviser John O. Brennan, also in charge of counterterrorism operations focused on al-Qaeda, led the U.S. side. His Mexican partner was CISEN director Valdes. “We got people together to define the operations,” Valdes said in an interview here. Every new program was vetted by Mexico’s security team and often by Calderon. The day-to-day operations were conceived in Mexico and approved by the U.S. ambassador at the time, Carlos Pascual, and the specific Mexican agency head involved. Games - Click Here for More! The first important decision was to use the same “high-value target” strategy that had been so successful against al-Qaeda in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. authorities used real-time intelligence against kingpins on a Mexican-U.S. priority list — including cellphone geolocation, wiretaps, electronic intercepts and tracking of digital records — to help Mexican authorities target them. The second was to clean up the Mexican units that would be responsible for carrying out raids. As early as 1997, the DEA had funded the creation of Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) made up of foreign nationals, first in Colombia, then in Bolivia, Peru and Mexico, and eventually in nine other countries. By mid-2006, the DEA had two units with a total of 184 members in Mexico alone, according to a DEA inspector general’s report. The Mexicans were brought for training to the DEA’s facility at Quantico. Mexico does not allow U.S. agents to take part in the actual raids, but they can be involved in planning operations and can even direct them remotely. The CIA also has trained units in raid tactics, protection of senior officials, intelligence collecting and, in a departure for the spy agency, in gathering and preserving evidence that can be used in court. To guard against penetration from the cartels, members were polygraphed, drug-tested and vetted for criminal and financial irregularities. But operations were still routinely exposed by moles inserted by the cartels. So, beginning in 2009, the size of the units was cut significantly. Those who remained worked under cover and lived in secret safe houses. The U.S. agencies they worked with provided special cellphones and even paid their salaries and set up their bank accounts. There are now six or seven SIUs in Mexico, sponsored by the DEA, CIA and at least one other U.S. law enforcement agency. Games - Click Here for More! The two countries also have constructed an elaborate physical infrastructure and developed protocols for sharing sensitive, often real-time intelligence. Garza, the former U.S. ambassador, called it “the plumbing” of the security relationship. “We started to appreciate that the same sort of plumbing construction for counterterrorism naturally translated into other security cooperation,” he said. By 2011, the plumbing extended to a CIA-run fusion center in Mexico City, a DEA-sponsored fusion center in Monterrey, a federal police bunker of “Star Wars”-like screens and computer terminals, also in the capital city, as well as separate military and federal police intelligence centers and one inside the headquarters of CISEN. “They gave us intelligence, they helped teach us the 24-hour intelligence cycle, helped build up our intelligence centers and taught us the importance of connecting intelligence to operations,” said Valdes, the CISEN director until September 2011. “Both DEA and the [CIA] helped, and we had a high level of support from Washington.” The infrastructure also has included regional law enforcement headquarters with temporary war rooms set up during large-scale Mexican military and federal police operations in Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Acapulco. To support Mexican operations in Ciudad Juarez, U.S. authorities arranged two brainstorming sessions at nearby Fort Bliss in Texas for their Mexican counterparts. Experts were brought in, including, upon Mexican request, the police chief of New Orleans, from whom they wanted to learn about the civilian large-scale control and relief measures after Hurricane Katrina. U.S. liaison officers remained on hand inside the federal police war room in Ciudad Juarez for more than two years, according to U.S. and former Mexican officials involved. The bulk of the U.S. work finding cartel members depends on the DEA’s exhaustive network of informants and undercover agents. Their information usually trumps what Mexican authorities bring to the table, particularly because local and state police remain riddled with corruption. DEA-provided information led to the killing of cartel leader Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009. The cartel not only moved significant quantities of cocaine into the United States but also had penetrated the highest level of Mexico’s institutions. His death gave Calderon his first significant victory in the militarized anti-cartel campaign. But planning for the Beltran Leyva operation had to overcome significant hitches. The CIA persuaded the embassy team to give the mission to a specialized Mexican army unit it was working with at the time. But the army chain of command dragged its feet. After several weeks of delay, the DEA insisted the mission be given to Mexico’s more aggressive Naval Special Forces. In another successful mission, the DEA in the summer of 2010 was able to locate the multiple cellphones of U.S.-born kingpin Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as “La Barbie” for his Ken-doll good looks. The drug agency tracked his travels over time, allowing Mexican authorities to pursue him through five Mexican states. He was captured in August 2010 and is in Mexican custody, still awaiting extradition to the United States. Drones became part of the mix, too. In July 2009, hours after Mexican smugglers shot and killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent while trying to steal his night-vision goggles, U.S. authorities were given permission to fly an unarmed Predator drone into Mexican airspace to hunt for suspects. Intelligence from the flights was passed to the Mexican army. Within 12 hours, the army brought back more information, according to two U.S. officials involved in the operation. Eventually, four suspects were captured. Three pleaded guilty, one is awaiting trial and a fifth remains at large. That first flight dispelled Mexican fears that U.S. authorities would try to take control of drone operations. An agreement was reached that would temporarily give operational control to Mexican authorities during such flights. U.S. pilots sitting in the States would control the planes remotely, but a Mexican military or federal police commander would be able to direct the pilot within the boundaries of a Mexico-designated grid. By late 2010, drones were flying deeper into Mexico to spy on the cartels, as they did during the two-day gun battle involving 800 federal police that resulted in the death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, head of the ultra-violent La Familia Michoacana cartel. By then, Mexican authorities had grown so enamored with drones that they were requesting more flights than the United States could deliver, given that most of the aircraft were being used to support operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan. So Mexican authorities bought their own drones. The first public indication of this development came when one crashed in El Paso in December 2010.

Mexico’s new approach Four months and many conversations after the Dec. 15 meeting, the new Mexican government is still fleshing out the details of its counterdrug approach. In a visit to Washington two weeks ago, Mexico’s top security team shared the broad outlines of the plan with U.S. agencies, according to U.S. and Mexican officials. It contains many changes. The president will not be nearly as directly involved in counterdrug efforts as Calderon was, the officials said. The interior minister will coordinate the relationships between various Mexican and U.S. agencies and other Mexican units. The director of the Mexican intelligence agency will decide which Mexican agency should receive and act on sensitive U.S. information. Given the corruption of Mexican law enforcement and armed forces, U.S. officials said privately they would be unwilling to share sensitive information until they have vetted the people involved and understand how their information is to be protected. The Mexican government also plans to create five regional intelligence fusion centers, staffed with federal and state officials, and to build a 10,000-member super police force. This force would be steeped in military discipline but would use police tactics, rather than overwhelming military force, to keep violence to a minimum. Medina Mora, the Mexican ambassador, said in an interview that his nation considers U.S. help in the drug war “a centerpiece” of Mexico’s counternarcotics strategy. But the Mexican delegation in Washington also informed U.S. authorities that Americans will no longer be allowed to work inside any fusion center, including the one in Monterrey.

MEXICO CITY — For the past seven years, Mexico and the United States have put aside their tension-filled history on security matters to forge an unparalleled alliance against Mexico’s drug cartels, one based on sharing sensitive intelligence, U.S. training and joint operational planning. But now, much of that hard-earned cooperation may be in jeopardy. The December inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieto brought the nationalistic Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) back to power after 13 years, and with it a whiff of resentment over the deep U.S. involvement in Mexico’s fight against narco-traffickers. The new administration has shifted priorities away from the U.S.-backed strategy of arresting kingpins, which sparked an unprecedented level of violence among the cartels, and toward an emphasis on prevention and keeping Mexico’s streets safe and calm, Mexican authorities said.

Mexico remains the U.S. market’s largest supplier of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and the transshipment point for 95 percent of its cocaine. No one had come up with a quick, realistic alternative to Calderon’s novel use of the Mexican military with U.S. support.

The roots of cooperation U.S. involvement in Mexico’s deteriorating internal security first peaked in the mid-1980s when the cocaine epidemic in the United States turned the southern neighbor into a prosperous distribution route north. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive instructing U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to help defeat the growing narco-trafficking menace worldwide. Beginning in the late 1980s, a massive U.S. air, sea and land effort was shutting down many Caribbean drug routes. The traffickers were increasingly forced to move their product through the only territory left unhindered: Mexico. Mexico’s secret security ties with the United States date at least to the Cold War, when Mexico City was a hub of intrigue, the “Beirut of the Western Hemisphere,” according to intelligence history scholar Sergio Aguayo. To keep an eye on the United States, the Soviet Union and China had their largest embassies here, necessitating a large CIA presence. Back then, the Mexican intelligence service, CISEN, “was basically run by the CIA,” according to one former CISEN official. Although that has changed with time, the unusually close relationship between Mexican presidents and CIA chiefs has not. Then-CIA director David H. Petraeus attended a party at the Mexican Embassy in Washington in 2011 and visited Calderon in Mexico last year. As many of his predecessors had done, Calderon usually met with the CIA director when he came to Washington. The CIA’s importance here can be explained, in part, by the historically strained dealings between Mexico and the DEA and U.S. military. “There was a void that the CIA stepped into,” said Jeffrey S. Davidow, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and author of a book about the prickly relationship between the two countries. In the mid-1980s, the DEA had been virtually banished from the country because of its aggressive pursuit of a slain DEA agent’s killers. But that relationship has improved greatly in the past five years. Now, the DEA has more employees in Mexico than in any other of its 67 foreign posts. In 2000, a political earthquake in Mexico paved the way for a less suspicious era between the two neighbors. The 71-year political reign of the authoritarian and corrupt PRI ended with the election of Vicente Fox of the National Action Party as president. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States turned the new openness into unprecedented bilateral action against terrorism. The two countries fortified the border with personnel and surveillance technology. Eventually, a protocol was worked out for Mexico to stop, detain and interrogate non-Mexicans traveling north toward the United States.

By the time Calderon was inaugurated in late 2006, many experts believed that Mexico was losing control of parts of the country. Even before his inauguration, Calderon pleaded with President George W. Bush to help the Mexican military quash the cartels, according to Antonio Garza, then U.S. ambassador to Mexico, who attended a meeting between the presidents.

In a little-noticed move, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence took a leading role in the U.S. effort to defeat the cartels, signaling the importance of intelligence in combating organized crime. By then, cartels had begun employing assassination squads, according to Guillermo Valdes, who was CISEN director at the time. CISEN discovered from a captured videotape and a special analytical group it set up that some of the cartels had hired former members of the U.S.-trained Guatemalan special forces, the Kaibiles, to create sociopathic killers who could behead a man, torture a child or immerse a captive in a vat of acid.

As the Mexican death toll mounted, Calderon pleaded with Bush for armed drones. He had been impressed by the results in Iraq and Afghanistan, two former U.S. officials said. The White House considered the request, but quickly rejected it. It was far too likely to result in collateral damage, they said. Violence deepened ties By 2009, President Obama’s first year in office, horrific scenes had become commonplace throughout Mexico: severed heads thrown onto a dance floor, a half-dozen bodies hanged from a bridge, bombs embedded in cadavers. Ciudad Juarez, a stone’s throw from El Paso, was a virtual killing zone. Obama approved an intensification of bilateral measures. Deputy national security adviser John O. Brennan, also in charge of counterterrorism operations focused on al-Qaeda, led the U.S. side. His Mexican partner was CISEN director Valdes. “We got people together to define the operations,” Valdes said in an interview here. Every new program was vetted by Mexico’s security team and often by Calderon. The day-to-day operations were conceived in Mexico and approved by the U.S. ambassador at the time, Carlos Pascual, and the specific Mexican agency head involved. Games - Click Here for More! The first important decision was to use the same “high-value target” strategy that had been so successful against al-Qaeda in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. authorities used real-time intelligence against kingpins on a Mexican-U.S. priority list — including cellphone geolocation, wiretaps, electronic intercepts and tracking of digital records — to help Mexican authorities target them. The second was to clean up the Mexican units that would be responsible for carrying out raids. As early as 1997, the DEA had funded the creation of Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) made up of foreign nationals, first in Colombia, then in Bolivia, Peru and Mexico, and eventually in nine other countries. By mid-2006, the DEA had two units with a total of 184 members in Mexico alone, according to a DEA inspector general’s report. The Mexicans were brought for training to the DEA’s facility at Quantico. Mexico does not allow U.S. agents to take part in the actual raids, but they can be involved in planning operations and can even direct them remotely. The CIA also has trained units in raid tactics, protection of senior officials, intelligence collecting and, in a departure for the spy agency, in gathering and preserving evidence that can be used in court. To guard against penetration from the cartels, members were polygraphed, drug-tested and vetted for criminal and financial irregularities. But operations were still routinely exposed by moles inserted by the cartels. So, beginning in 2009, the size of the units was cut significantly. Those who remained worked under cover and lived in secret safe houses. The U.S. agencies they worked with provided special cellphones and even paid their salaries and set up their bank accounts. There are now six or seven SIUs in Mexico, sponsored by the DEA, CIA and at least one other U.S. law enforcement agency. Games - Click Here for More! The two countries also have constructed an elaborate physical infrastructure and developed protocols for sharing sensitive, often real-time intelligence. Garza, the former U.S. ambassador, called it “the plumbing” of the security relationship. “We started to appreciate that the same sort of plumbing construction for counterterrorism naturally translated into other security cooperation,” he said. By 2011, the plumbing extended to a CIA-run fusion center in Mexico City, a DEA-sponsored fusion center in Monterrey, a federal police bunker of “Star Wars”-like screens and computer terminals, also in the capital city, as well as separate military and federal police intelligence centers and one inside the headquarters of CISEN. “They gave us intelligence, they helped teach us the 24-hour intelligence cycle, helped build up our intelligence centers and taught us the importance of connecting intelligence to operations,” said Valdes, the CISEN director until September 2011. “Both DEA and the [CIA] helped, and we had a high level of support from Washington.” The infrastructure also has included regional law enforcement headquarters with temporary war rooms set up during large-scale Mexican military and federal police operations in Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Acapulco. To support Mexican operations in Ciudad Juarez, U.S. authorities arranged two brainstorming sessions at nearby Fort Bliss in Texas for their Mexican counterparts. Experts were brought in, including, upon Mexican request, the police chief of New Orleans, from whom they wanted to learn about the civilian large-scale control and relief measures after Hurricane Katrina. U.S. liaison officers remained on hand inside the federal police war room in Ciudad Juarez for more than two years, according to U.S. and former Mexican officials involved. The bulk of the U.S. work finding cartel members depends on the DEA’s exhaustive network of informants and undercover agents. Their information usually trumps what Mexican authorities bring to the table, particularly because local and state police remain riddled with corruption. DEA-provided information led to the killing of cartel leader Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009. The cartel not only moved significant quantities of cocaine into the United States but also had penetrated the highest level of Mexico’s institutions. His death gave Calderon his first significant victory in the militarized anti-cartel campaign. But planning for the Beltran Leyva operation had to overcome significant hitches. The CIA persuaded the embassy team to give the mission to a specialized Mexican army unit it was working with at the time. But the army chain of command dragged its feet. After several weeks of delay, the DEA insisted the mission be given to Mexico’s more aggressive Naval Special Forces. In another successful mission, the DEA in the summer of 2010 was able to locate the multiple cellphones of U.S.-born kingpin Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as “La Barbie” for his Ken-doll good looks. The drug agency tracked his travels over time, allowing Mexican authorities to pursue him through five Mexican states. He was captured in August 2010 and is in Mexican custody, still awaiting extradition to the United States. Drones became part of the mix, too. In July 2009, hours after Mexican smugglers shot and killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent while trying to steal his night-vision goggles, U.S. authorities were given permission to fly an unarmed Predator drone into Mexican airspace to hunt for suspects. Intelligence from the flights was passed to the Mexican army. Within 12 hours, the army brought back more information, according to two U.S. officials involved in the operation. Eventually, four suspects were captured. Three pleaded guilty, one is awaiting trial and a fifth remains at large. That first flight dispelled Mexican fears that U.S. authorities would try to take control of drone operations. An agreement was reached that would temporarily give operational control to Mexican authorities during such flights. U.S. pilots sitting in the States would control the planes remotely, but a Mexican military or federal police commander would be able to direct the pilot within the boundaries of a Mexico-designated grid. By late 2010, drones were flying deeper into Mexico to spy on the cartels, as they did during the two-day gun battle involving 800 federal police that resulted in the death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, head of the ultra-violent La Familia Michoacana cartel. By then, Mexican authorities had grown so enamored with drones that they were requesting more flights than the United States could deliver, given that most of the aircraft were being used to support operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan. So Mexican authorities bought their own drones. The first public indication of this development came when one crashed in El Paso in December 2010.

Mexico’s new approach Four months and many conversations after the Dec. 15 meeting, the new Mexican government is still fleshing out the details of its counterdrug approach. In a visit to Washington two weeks ago, Mexico’s top security team shared the broad outlines of the plan with U.S. agencies, according to U.S. and Mexican officials. It contains many changes. The president will not be nearly as directly involved in counterdrug efforts as Calderon was, the officials said. The interior minister will coordinate the relationships between various Mexican and U.S. agencies and other Mexican units. The director of the Mexican intelligence agency will decide which Mexican agency should receive and act on sensitive U.S. information. Given the corruption of Mexican law enforcement and armed forces, U.S. officials said privately they would be unwilling to share sensitive information until they have vetted the people involved and understand how their information is to be protected. The Mexican government also plans to create five regional intelligence fusion centers, staffed with federal and state officials, and to build a 10,000-member super police force. This force would be steeped in military discipline but would use police tactics, rather than overwhelming military force, to keep violence to a minimum. Medina Mora, the Mexican ambassador, said in an interview that his nation considers U.S. help in the drug war “a centerpiece” of Mexico’s counternarcotics strategy. But the Mexican delegation in Washington also informed U.S. authorities that Americans will no longer be allowed to work inside any fusion center, including the one in Monterrey.

MEXICO CITY — For the past seven years, Mexico and the United States have put aside their tension-filled history on security matters to forge an unparalleled alliance against Mexico’s drug cartels, one based on sharing sensitive intelligence, U.S. training and joint operational planning. But now, much of that hard-earned cooperation may be in jeopardy. The December inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieto brought the nationalistic Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) back to power after 13 years, and with it a whiff of resentment over the deep U.S. involvement in Mexico’s fight against narco-traffickers. The new administration has shifted priorities away from the U.S.-backed strategy of arresting kingpins, which sparked an unprecedented level of violence among the cartels, and toward an emphasis on prevention and keeping Mexico’s streets safe and calm, Mexican authorities said. Some U.S. officials fear the coming of an unofficial truce with cartel leaders. The Mexicans see it otherwise. “The objective of fighting organized crime is not in conflict with achieving peace,” said Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico’s ambassador to the United States. Drugs and homicides in Mexico. Interviews with more than four dozen current and former U.S. and Mexican diplomats, law enforcement agents, military officers and intelligence officials — most of whom agreed to speak about sensitive matters only on condition of anonymity — paint the most detailed public portrait to date of how the two countries grew so close after so many years of distance and distrust, and what is at stake should the alliance be scaled back. U.S. officials got their first inkling that the relationship might change just two weeks after Peña Nieto assumed office Dec. 1. At the U.S. ambassador’s request, the new president sent his top five security officials to an unusual meeting at the U.S. Embassy here. In a crowded conference room, the new attorney general and interior minister sat in silence, not knowing what to expect, next to the new leaders of the army, navy and Mexican intelligence agency. In front of them at the Dec. 15 meeting were representatives from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the CIA, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other U.S. agencies tasked with helping Mexico destroy the drug cartels that had besieged the country for the past decade. The Mexicans remained stone-faced as they learned for the first time just how entwined the two countries had become during the battle against narco-traffickers, and how, in the process, the United States had been given near-complete entree to Mexico’s territory and the secrets of its citizens, according to several U.S. officials familiar with the meeting. The administration of former president Felipe Calderon had granted high-flying U.S. spy planes access to Mexican airspace for the purpose of gathering intelligence. Unarmed Customs and Border Protection drones had flown from bases in the United States in support of Mexican military and federal police raids against drug targets and to track movements that would establish suspects’ “patterns of life.” The United States had also provided electronic signals technology, ground sensors, voice-recognition gear, cellphone-tracking devices, data analysis tools, computer hacking kits and airborne cameras that could read license plates from three miles away. Under a classified program code-named SCENIC, the CIA was training Mexicans in how to target and vet potential assets for recruitment and how to guard against infiltration by narco-traffickers. In deference to their visitors, the U.S. briefers left out the fact that most of the 25 kingpin taken off the streets in the past five years had been removed because of U.S.-supplied information, often including the location of top cartel members in real time, according to people familiar with the meeting. The CIA and Calderon declined to comment for this article. Also unremarked upon was the mounting criticism that success against the cartels’ leadership had helped incite more violence than anyone had predicted, more than 60,000 deaths and 25,000 disappearances in the past seven years alone. Meanwhile, the drug flow into the United States continued unabated. Mexico remains the U.S. market’s largest supplier of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and the transshipment point for 95 percent of its cocaine. No one had come up with a quick, realistic alternative to Calderon’s novel use of the Mexican military with U.S. support. But stopping the cartel violence had become Peña Nieto’s top priority during the campaign. The U.S. administration didn’t know what that meant. Some feared a scaling back of the bilateral efforts and a willingness to trade the relentless drive against cartel leaders for calmer streets. When the Dec. 15 meeting concluded, Mexico’s new security officials remained poker-faced, “They said they were very appreciative to have received so much information,” said one U.S. official familiar with the meeting. We will be in touch, they added, and left.
The roots of cooperation U.S. involvement in Mexico’s deteriorating internal security first peaked in the mid-1980s when the cocaine epidemic in the United States turned the southern neighbor into a prosperous distribution route north. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive instructing U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to help defeat the growing narco-trafficking menace worldwide. Beginning in the late 1980s, a massive U.S. air, sea and land effort was shutting down many Caribbean drug routes. The traffickers were increasingly forced to move their product through the only territory left unhindered: Mexico. Mexico’s secret security ties with the United States date at least to the Cold War, when Mexico City was a hub of intrigue, the “Beirut of the Western Hemisphere,” according to intelligence history scholar Sergio Aguayo. To keep an eye on the United States, the Soviet Union and China had their largest embassies here, necessitating a large CIA presence. Back then, the Mexican intelligence service, CISEN, “was basically run by the CIA,” according to one former CISEN official. Although that has changed with time, the unusually close relationship between Mexican presidents and CIA chiefs has not. Then-CIA director David H. Petraeus attended a party at the Mexican Embassy in Washington in 2011 and visited Calderon in Mexico last year. As many of his predecessors had done, Calderon usually met with the CIA director when he came to Washington. The CIA’s importance here can be explained, in part, by the historically strained dealings between Mexico and the DEA and U.S. military. “There was a void that the CIA stepped into,” said Jeffrey S. Davidow, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and author of a book about the prickly relationship between the two countries. In the mid-1980s, the DEA had been virtually banished from the country because of its aggressive pursuit of a slain DEA agent’s killers. But that relationship has improved greatly in the past five years. Now, the DEA has more employees in Mexico than in any other of its 67 foreign posts. In 2000, a political earthquake in Mexico paved the way for a less suspicious era between the two neighbors. The 71-year political reign of the authoritarian and corrupt PRI ended with the election of Vicente Fox of the National Action Party as president. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States turned the new openness into unprecedented bilateral action against terrorism. The two countries fortified the border with personnel and surveillance technology. Eventually, a protocol was worked out for Mexico to stop, detain and interrogate non-Mexicans traveling north toward the United States. Mexican authorities allow U.S. officials to remotely question third-country nationals of concern to the United States, according to Mexican and U.S. officials. Clamping down on illegal border crossings, however, had an unintended consequence: It upset agreements among the cartels over smuggling routes, sparking yet more violent competition. By the time Calderon was inaugurated in late 2006, many experts believed that Mexico was losing control of parts of the country. Even before his inauguration, Calderon pleaded with President George W. Bush to help the Mexican military quash the cartels, according to Antonio Garza, then U.S. ambassador to Mexico, who attended a meeting between the presidents. Bush agreed to help, and the Merida Initiative, a $1.9 billion aid package for military training and equipment and judicial reform, set the framework for a new level of U.S.-Mexican cooperation. In a little-noticed move, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence took a leading role in the U.S. effort to defeat the cartels, signaling the importance of intelligence in combating organized crime. By then, cartels had begun employing assassination squads, according to Guillermo Valdes, who was CISEN director at the time. CISEN discovered from a captured videotape and a special analytical group it set up that some of the cartels had hired former members of the U.S.-trained Guatemalan special forces, the Kaibiles, to create sociopathic killers who could behead a man, torture a child or immerse a captive in a vat of acid. Anxious to counterattack, the CIA proposed electronically emptying the bank accounts of drug kingpins, but was turned down by the Treasury Department and the White House, which feared unleashing chaos in the banking system. As the Mexican death toll mounted, Calderon pleaded with Bush for armed drones. He had been impressed by the results in Iraq and Afghanistan, two former U.S. officials said. The White House considered the request, but quickly rejected it. It was far too likely to result in collateral damage, they said. Violence deepened ties By 2009, President Obama’s first year in office, horrific scenes had become commonplace throughout Mexico: severed heads thrown onto a dance floor, a half-dozen bodies hanged from a bridge, bombs embedded in cadavers. Ciudad Juarez, a stone’s throw from El Paso, was a virtual killing zone. Obama approved an intensification of bilateral measures. Deputy national security adviser John O. Brennan, also in charge of counterterrorism operations focused on al-Qaeda, led the U.S. side. His Mexican partner was CISEN director Valdes. “We got people together to define the operations,” Valdes said in an interview here. Every new program was vetted by Mexico’s security team and often by Calderon. The day-to-day operations were conceived in Mexico and approved by the U.S. ambassador at the time, Carlos Pascual, and the specific Mexican agency head involved. Games - Click Here for More! The first important decision was to use the same “high-value target” strategy that had been so successful against al-Qaeda in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. authorities used real-time intelligence against kingpins on a Mexican-U.S. priority list — including cellphone geolocation, wiretaps, electronic intercepts and tracking of digital records — to help Mexican authorities target them. The second was to clean up the Mexican units that would be responsible for carrying out raids. As early as 1997, the DEA had funded the creation of Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) made up of foreign nationals, first in Colombia, then in Bolivia, Peru and Mexico, and eventually in nine other countries. By mid-2006, the DEA had two units with a total of 184 members in Mexico alone, according to a DEA inspector general’s report. The Mexicans were brought for training to the DEA’s facility at Quantico. Mexico does not allow U.S. agents to take part in the actual raids, but they can be involved in planning operations and can even direct them remotely. The CIA also has trained units in raid tactics, protection of senior officials, intelligence collecting and, in a departure for the spy agency, in gathering and preserving evidence that can be used in court. To guard against penetration from the cartels, members were polygraphed, drug-tested and vetted for criminal and financial irregularities. But operations were still routinely exposed by moles inserted by the cartels. So, beginning in 2009, the size of the units was cut significantly. Those who remained worked under cover and lived in secret safe houses. The U.S. agencies they worked with provided special cellphones and even paid their salaries and set up their bank accounts. There are now six or seven SIUs in Mexico, sponsored by the DEA, CIA and at least one other U.S. law enforcement agency. Games - Click Here for More! The two countries also have constructed an elaborate physical infrastructure and developed protocols for sharing sensitive, often real-time intelligence. Garza, the former U.S. ambassador, called it “the plumbing” of the security relationship. “We started to appreciate that the same sort of plumbing construction for counterterrorism naturally translated into other security cooperation,” he said. By 2011, the plumbing extended to a CIA-run fusion center in Mexico City, a DEA-sponsored fusion center in Monterrey, a federal police bunker of “Star Wars”-like screens and computer terminals, also in the capital city, as well as separate military and federal police intelligence centers and one inside the headquarters of CISEN. “They gave us intelligence, they helped teach us the 24-hour intelligence cycle, helped build up our intelligence centers and taught us the importance of connecting intelligence to operations,” said Valdes, the CISEN director until September 2011. “Both DEA and the [CIA] helped, and we had a high level of support from Washington.” The infrastructure also has included regional law enforcement headquarters with temporary war rooms set up during large-scale Mexican military and federal police operations in Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Acapulco. To support Mexican operations in Ciudad Juarez, U.S. authorities arranged two brainstorming sessions at nearby Fort Bliss in Texas for their Mexican counterparts. Experts were brought in, including, upon Mexican request, the police chief of New Orleans, from whom they wanted to learn about the civilian large-scale control and relief measures after Hurricane Katrina. U.S. liaison officers remained on hand inside the federal police war room in Ciudad Juarez for more than two years, according to U.S. and former Mexican officials involved. The bulk of the U.S. work finding cartel members depends on the DEA’s exhaustive network of informants and undercover agents. Their information usually trumps what Mexican authorities bring to the table, particularly because local and state police remain riddled with corruption. DEA-provided information led to the killing of cartel leader Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009. The cartel not only moved significant quantities of cocaine into the United States but also had penetrated the highest level of Mexico’s institutions. His death gave Calderon his first significant victory in the militarized anti-cartel campaign. But planning for the Beltran Leyva operation had to overcome significant hitches. The CIA persuaded the embassy team to give the mission to a specialized Mexican army unit it was working with at the time. But the army chain of command dragged its feet. After several weeks of delay, the DEA insisted the mission be given to Mexico’s more aggressive Naval Special Forces. In another successful mission, the DEA in the summer of 2010 was able to locate the multiple cellphones of U.S.-born kingpin Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as “La Barbie” for his Ken-doll good looks. The drug agency tracked his travels over time, allowing Mexican authorities to pursue him through five Mexican states. He was captured in August 2010 and is in Mexican custody, still awaiting extradition to the United States. Drones became part of the mix, too. In July 2009, hours after Mexican smugglers shot and killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent while trying to steal his night-vision goggles, U.S. authorities were given permission to fly an unarmed Predator drone into Mexican airspace to hunt for suspects. Intelligence from the flights was passed to the Mexican army. Within 12 hours, the army brought back more information, according to two U.S. officials involved in the operation. Eventually, four suspects were captured. Three pleaded guilty, one is awaiting trial and a fifth remains at large. That first flight dispelled Mexican fears that U.S. authorities would try to take control of drone operations. An agreement was reached that would temporarily give operational control to Mexican authorities during such flights. U.S. pilots sitting in the States would control the planes remotely, but a Mexican military or federal police commander would be able to direct the pilot within the boundaries of a Mexico-designated grid. By late 2010, drones were flying deeper into Mexico to spy on the cartels, as they did during the two-day gun battle involving 800 federal police that resulted in the death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, head of the ultra-violent La Familia Michoacana cartel. By then, Mexican authorities had grown so enamored with drones that they were requesting more flights than the United States could deliver, given that most of the aircraft were being used to support operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan. So Mexican authorities bought their own drones. The first public indication of this development came when one crashed in El Paso in December 2010.

MEXICO CITY — For the past seven years, Mexico and the United States have put aside their tension-filled history on security matters to forge an unparalleled alliance against Mexico’s drug cartels, one based on sharing sensitive intelligence, U.S. training and joint operational planning. But now, much of that hard-earned cooperation may be in jeopardy. The December inauguration of President Enrique Peña Nieto brought the nationalistic Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) back to power after 13 years, and with it a whiff of resentment over the deep U.S. involvement in Mexico’s fight against narco-traffickers. The new administration has shifted priorities away from the U.S.-backed strategy of arresting kingpins, which sparked an unprecedented level of violence among the cartels, and toward an emphasis on prevention and keeping Mexico’s streets safe and calm, Mexican authorities said. Some U.S. officials fear the coming of an unofficial truce with cartel leaders. The Mexicans see it otherwise. “The objective of fighting organized crime is not in conflict with achieving peace,” said Eduardo Medina Mora, Mexico’s ambassador to the United States. Drugs and homicides in Mexico. Interviews with more than four dozen current and former U.S. and Mexican diplomats, law enforcement agents, military officers and intelligence officials — most of whom agreed to speak about sensitive matters only on condition of anonymity — paint the most detailed public portrait to date of how the two countries grew so close after so many years of distance and distrust, and what is at stake should the alliance be scaled back. U.S. officials got their first inkling that the relationship might change just two weeks after Peña Nieto assumed office Dec. 1. At the U.S. ambassador’s request, the new president sent his top five security officials to an unusual meeting at the U.S. Embassy here. In a crowded conference room, the new attorney general and interior minister sat in silence, not knowing what to expect, next to the new leaders of the army, navy and Mexican intelligence agency. In front of them at the Dec. 15 meeting were representatives from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the CIA, the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and other U.S. agencies tasked with helping Mexico destroy the drug cartels that had besieged the country for the past decade. The Mexicans remained stone-faced as they learned for the first time just how entwined the two countries had become during the battle against narco-traffickers, and how, in the process, the United States had been given near-complete entree to Mexico’s territory and the secrets of its citizens, according to several U.S. officials familiar with the meeting.

Under a classified program code-named SCENIC, the CIA was training Mexicans in how to target and vet potential assets for recruitment and how to guard against infiltration by narco-traffickers. In deference to their visitors, the U.S. briefers left out the fact that most of the 25 kingpin taken off the streets in the past five years had been removed because of U.S.-supplied information, often including the location of top cartel members in real time, according to people familiar with the meeting.

Also unremarked upon was the mounting criticism that success against the cartels’ leadership had helped incite more violence than anyone had predicted, more than 60,000 deaths and 25,000 disappearances in the past seven years alone. Meanwhile, the drug flow into the United States continued unabated. Mexico remains the U.S. market’s largest supplier of heroin, marijuana and methamphetamine and the transshipment point for 95 percent of its cocaine. No one had come up with a quick, realistic alternative to Calderon’s novel use of the Mexican military with U.S. support. But stopping the cartel violence had become Peña Nieto’s top priority during the campaign. The U.S. administration didn’t know what that meant. Some feared a scaling back of the bilateral efforts and a willingness to trade the relentless drive against cartel leaders for calmer streets. When the Dec. 15 meeting concluded, Mexico’s new security officials remained poker-faced, “They said they were very appreciative to have received so much information,” said one U.S. official familiar with the meeting. We will be in touch, they added, and left.
The roots of cooperation U.S. involvement in Mexico’s deteriorating internal security first peaked in the mid-1980s when the cocaine epidemic in the United States turned the southern neighbor into a prosperous distribution route north. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive instructing U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies to help defeat the growing narco-trafficking menace worldwide. Beginning in the late 1980s, a massive U.S. air, sea and land effort was shutting down many Caribbean drug routes. The traffickers were increasingly forced to move their product through the only territory left unhindered: Mexico. Mexico’s secret security ties with the United States date at least to the Cold War, when Mexico City was a hub of intrigue, the “Beirut of the Western Hemisphere,” according to intelligence history scholar Sergio Aguayo. To keep an eye on the United States, the Soviet Union and China had their largest embassies here, necessitating a large CIA presence. Back then, the Mexican intelligence service, CISEN, “was basically run by the CIA,” according to one former CISEN official. Although that has changed with time, the unusually close relationship between Mexican presidents and CIA chiefs has not. Then-CIA director David H. Petraeus attended a party at the Mexican Embassy in Washington in 2011 and visited Calderon in Mexico last year. As many of his predecessors had done, Calderon usually met with the CIA director when he came to Washington. The CIA’s importance here can be explained, in part, by the historically strained dealings between Mexico and the DEA and U.S. military. “There was a void that the CIA stepped into,” said Jeffrey S. Davidow, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and author of a book about the prickly relationship between the two countries. In the mid-1980s, the DEA had been virtually banished from the country because of its aggressive pursuit of a slain DEA agent’s killers. But that relationship has improved greatly in the past five years. Now, the DEA has more employees in Mexico than in any other of its 67 foreign posts. In 2000, a political earthquake in Mexico paved the way for a less suspicious era between the two neighbors. The 71-year political reign of the authoritarian and corrupt PRI ended with the election of Vicente Fox of the National Action Party as president. The Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States turned the new openness into unprecedented bilateral action against terrorism. The two countries fortified the border with personnel and surveillance technology. Eventually, a protocol was worked out for Mexico to stop, detain and interrogate non-Mexicans traveling north toward the United States. Mexican authorities allow U.S. officials to remotely question third-country nationals of concern to the United States, according to Mexican and U.S. officials. Clamping down on illegal border crossings, however, had an unintended consequence: It upset agreements among the cartels over smuggling routes, sparking yet more violent competition. By the time Calderon was inaugurated in late 2006, many experts believed that Mexico was losing control of parts of the country. Even before his inauguration, Calderon pleaded with President George W. Bush to help the Mexican military quash the cartels, according to Antonio Garza, then U.S. ambassador to Mexico, who attended a meeting between the presidents. Bush agreed to help, and the Merida Initiative, a $1.9 billion aid package for military training and equipment and judicial reform, set the framework for a new level of U.S.-Mexican cooperation. In a little-noticed move, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence took a leading role in the U.S. effort to defeat the cartels, signaling the importance of intelligence in combating organized crime. By then, cartels had begun employing assassination squads, according to Guillermo Valdes, who was CISEN director at the time. CISEN discovered from a captured videotape and a special analytical group it set up that some of the cartels had hired former members of the U.S.-trained Guatemalan special forces, the Kaibiles, to create sociopathic killers who could behead a man, torture a child or immerse a captive in a vat of acid. Anxious to counterattack, the CIA proposed electronically emptying the bank accounts of drug kingpins, but was turned down by the Treasury Department and the White House, which feared unleashing chaos in the banking system. As the Mexican death toll mounted, Calderon pleaded with Bush for armed drones. He had been impressed by the results in Iraq and Afghanistan, two former U.S. officials said. The White House considered the request, but quickly rejected it. It was far too likely to result in collateral damage, they said. Violence deepened ties By 2009, President Obama’s first year in office, horrific scenes had become commonplace throughout Mexico: severed heads thrown onto a dance floor, a half-dozen bodies hanged from a bridge, bombs embedded in cadavers. Ciudad Juarez, a stone’s throw from El Paso, was a virtual killing zone. Obama approved an intensification of bilateral measures. Deputy national security adviser John O. Brennan, also in charge of counterterrorism operations focused on al-Qaeda, led the U.S. side. His Mexican partner was CISEN director Valdes. “We got people together to define the operations,” Valdes said in an interview here. Every new program was vetted by Mexico’s security team and often by Calderon. The day-to-day operations were conceived in Mexico and approved by the U.S. ambassador at the time, Carlos Pascual, and the specific Mexican agency head involved. Games - Click Here for More! The first important decision was to use the same “high-value target” strategy that had been so successful against al-Qaeda in Iraq and Afghanistan. U.S. authorities used real-time intelligence against kingpins on a Mexican-U.S. priority list — including cellphone geolocation, wiretaps, electronic intercepts and tracking of digital records — to help Mexican authorities target them. The second was to clean up the Mexican units that would be responsible for carrying out raids. As early as 1997, the DEA had funded the creation of Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) made up of foreign nationals, first in Colombia, then in Bolivia, Peru and Mexico, and eventually in nine other countries. By mid-2006, the DEA had two units with a total of 184 members in Mexico alone, according to a DEA inspector general’s report. The Mexicans were brought for training to the DEA’s facility at Quantico. Mexico does not allow U.S. agents to take part in the actual raids, but they can be involved in planning operations and can even direct them remotely. The CIA also has trained units in raid tactics, protection of senior officials, intelligence collecting and, in a departure for the spy agency, in gathering and preserving evidence that can be used in court. To guard against penetration from the cartels, members were polygraphed, drug-tested and vetted for criminal and financial irregularities. But operations were still routinely exposed by moles inserted by the cartels. So, beginning in 2009, the size of the units was cut significantly. Those who remained worked under cover and lived in secret safe houses. The U.S. agencies they worked with provided special cellphones and even paid their salaries and set up their bank accounts. There are now six or seven SIUs in Mexico, sponsored by the DEA, CIA and at least one other U.S. law enforcement agency. Games - Click Here for More! The two countries also have constructed an elaborate physical infrastructure and developed protocols for sharing sensitive, often real-time intelligence. Garza, the former U.S. ambassador, called it “the plumbing” of the security relationship. “We started to appreciate that the same sort of plumbing construction for counterterrorism naturally translated into other security cooperation,” he said. By 2011, the plumbing extended to a CIA-run fusion center in Mexico City, a DEA-sponsored fusion center in Monterrey, a federal police bunker of “Star Wars”-like screens and computer terminals, also in the capital city, as well as separate military and federal police intelligence centers and one inside the headquarters of CISEN. “They gave us intelligence, they helped teach us the 24-hour intelligence cycle, helped build up our intelligence centers and taught us the importance of connecting intelligence to operations,” said Valdes, the CISEN director until September 2011. “Both DEA and the [CIA] helped, and we had a high level of support from Washington.” The infrastructure also has included regional law enforcement headquarters with temporary war rooms set up during large-scale Mexican military and federal police operations in Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Acapulco. To support Mexican operations in Ciudad Juarez, U.S. authorities arranged two brainstorming sessions at nearby Fort Bliss in Texas for their Mexican counterparts. Experts were brought in, including, upon Mexican request, the police chief of New Orleans, from whom they wanted to learn about the civilian large-scale control and relief measures after Hurricane Katrina. U.S. liaison officers remained on hand inside the federal police war room in Ciudad Juarez for more than two years, according to U.S. and former Mexican officials involved. The bulk of the U.S. work finding cartel members depends on the DEA’s exhaustive network of informants and undercover agents. Their information usually trumps what Mexican authorities bring to the table, particularly because local and state police remain riddled with corruption. DEA-provided information led to the killing of cartel leader Arturo Beltran Leyva in December 2009. The cartel not only moved significant quantities of cocaine into the United States but also had penetrated the highest level of Mexico’s institutions. His death gave Calderon his first significant victory in the militarized anti-cartel campaign. But planning for the Beltran Leyva operation had to overcome significant hitches. The CIA persuaded the embassy team to give the mission to a specialized Mexican army unit it was working with at the time. But the army chain of command dragged its feet. After several weeks of delay, the DEA insisted the mission be given to Mexico’s more aggressive Naval Special Forces. In another successful mission, the DEA in the summer of 2010 was able to locate the multiple cellphones of U.S.-born kingpin Edgar Valdez Villarreal, known as “La Barbie” for his Ken-doll good looks. The drug agency tracked his travels over time, allowing Mexican authorities to pursue him through five Mexican states. He was captured in August 2010 and is in Mexican custody, still awaiting extradition to the United States. Drones became part of the mix, too. In July 2009, hours after Mexican smugglers shot and killed a U.S. Border Patrol agent while trying to steal his night-vision goggles, U.S. authorities were given permission to fly an unarmed Predator drone into Mexican airspace to hunt for suspects. Intelligence from the flights was passed to the Mexican army. Within 12 hours, the army brought back more information, according to two U.S. officials involved in the operation. Eventually, four suspects were captured. Three pleaded guilty, one is awaiting trial and a fifth remains at large. That first flight dispelled Mexican fears that U.S. authorities would try to take control of drone operations. An agreement was reached that would temporarily give operational control to Mexican authorities during such flights. U.S. pilots sitting in the States would control the planes remotely, but a Mexican military or federal police commander would be able to direct the pilot within the boundaries of a Mexico-designated grid. By late 2010, drones were flying deeper into Mexico to spy on the cartels, as they did during the two-day gun battle involving 800 federal police that resulted in the death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, head of the ultra-violent La Familia Michoacana cartel. By then, Mexican authorities had grown so enamored with drones that they were requesting more flights than the United States could deliver, given that most of the aircraft were being used to support operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen and Pakistan. So Mexican authorities bought their own drones. The first public indication of this development came when one crashed in El Paso in December 2010.

Mexico’s new approach Four months and many conversations after the Dec. 15 meeting, the new Mexican government is still fleshing out the details of its counterdrug approach. In a visit to Washington two weeks ago, Mexico’s top security team shared the broad outlines of the plan with U.S. agencies, according to U.S. and Mexican officials. It contains many changes. The president will not be nearly as directly involved in counterdrug efforts as Calderon was, the officials said. The interior minister will coordinate the relationships between various Mexican and U.S. agencies and other Mexican units. The director of the Mexican intelligence agency will decide which Mexican agency should receive and act on sensitive U.S. information. Given the corruption of Mexican law enforcement and armed forces, U.S. officials said privately they would be unwilling to share sensitive information until they have vetted the people involved and understand how their information is to be protected. The Mexican government also plans to create five regional intelligence fusion centers, staffed with federal and state officials, and to build a 10,000-member super police force. This force would be steeped in military discipline but would use police tactics, rather than overwhelming military force, to keep violence to a minimum. Medina Mora, the Mexican ambassador, said in an interview that his nation considers U.S. help in the drug war “a centerpiece” of Mexico’s counternarcotics strategy. But the Mexican delegation in Washington also informed U.S. authorities that Americans will no longer be allowed to work inside any fusion center, including the one in Monterrey. The DEA agents and retired military contractors there will have to go.",summarize the following text: ,"Mexico and the United States alliance against Mexico’s drug cartels based on sharing sensitive intelligence, U.S. training and joint operational planning. may be in jeopardy Nieto brought the PRI back to power with a whiff of resentment over the deep U.S. involvement in Mexico’s fight against narco-traffickers. The new administration has shifted priorities away from the U.S.-backed strategy of arresting kingpins and toward an emphasis on prevention and keeping Mexico’s streets safe and calm U.S. officials fear the coming of an unofficial truce with cartel leaders.

Hon ANNETTE KING (Minister of Health) : I move, That the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill be now read a first time. At the appropriate time I will move that the bill be referred to the Health Committee for consideration, that the committee present its final report on or before 28 May 2005, and that the committee have the authority to meet at any time while the House is sitting, except during oral questions, and during any evening on a day on which there has been a sitting of the House, and on a Friday in a week in which there has been a sitting of the House, despite Standing Orders 191 and 194(1)(b) and (c). Xenotransplantation is the implantation of living biological material from animals into humans. The Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill extends the period of the current controls on xenotransplantation until 31 December 2006, with the ability for this state to be extended by Order in Council if necessary. The current controls were introduced in response to concerns about the potential of threats of xenotransplants transmitting new infections to recipients and to the wider community; the adequacy of regulatory review processes; and the cultural, social, and ethical issues associated with xenotransplantation. The current controls allow xenotransplantation trials to be considered and approved by the Minister of Health but require strict criteria to be met before an approval is given. No applications have been made to the Minister of Health under the current provisions. Without this bill, the existing additional controls on xenotransplantation will end on 30 June 2005 with the expiry of Part 7A of the Medicines Act. After this state the scientific and ethical oversight will return to the controls utilised for clinical trials of medicines contained in section 30 of the Medicines Act. Section 30 controls were previously identified as being inadequate, and, despite further information on xenotransplantation being published, I am advised there is still a need for additional oversight of this controversial emerging technology. Existing controls cannot be extended further under existing legislation, hence the need for this bill. Ongoing controls are needed on xenotransplantation because it is still only an experimental technique. It is unclear whether this technique would be successful within humans. There is also a risk of transmitting viruses from animals to humans. There are only a small number of animal or human studies of possible efficacy, and it is far from clear whether a transplanted animal organ would function properly in a human. Evidence indicates that xenotransplantation may be associated with an increased risk of transmission of a wide range of viral, bacterial, and other infections known to occur in the sourced animals. There is a theoretical risk that xenotransplantation could increase the risk of new infections jumping the species barrier from animals to humans. In view of concerns about the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation, similar jurisdictions—including Australia, Canada, and the UK—have stringent controls on xenotransplantation. To my knowledge there are currently no clinical trials under way in those countries. In December 2004 the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council announced a 5-year moratorium on clinical trials of xenotransplantation. New Zealand would be going out on a limb if we allowed these controls to lapse. I commend this bill to the House. Dr PAUL HUTCHISON (National—Port Waikato) : Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this very important bill, the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill. Opposition Members: This is the next Minister of Health! Dr PAUL HUTCHISON: Those members are absolutely right. This bill is a serious indictment on this Labour Government’s integrity and its attitude towards science. In essence, this bill is the continuation of a blunt instrument that the Labour Government put on science in order to stop xenotransplantation in New Zealand back in 2001—now the Government wants to continue it until 2006. This bill is a serious indictment on Labour. The Prime Minister, her health Minister, and her science Minister all say they are committed to science and are committed to economic growth. We have a classic situation in which they have said: “Let’s focus on biotechnology as one of the main strands of economic growth in New Zealand.”, yet they have created in this country some of the most difficult hurdles to the carrying out of biotechnology in the Western World. We know that the Government’s own biotechnology task force has said exactly that—that the regulatory regime in New Zealand is very difficult and that it is forcing top New Zealand scientists to do their work overseas or to leave. I shall give two examples. The first is the Huntington’s chorea trial that was, basically, founded at the Auckland School of Medicine. The reason it did not continue in New Zealand was that it cost too much and would take too long. Consequently, it has gone to Adelaide. That is a tragedy for New Zealand science, a tragedy for New Zealand biotechnology. It is hugely important to have a complement of scientists in New Zealand who are capable in the new genetics. If we do not, we will not even recognise the problems until they have got here, and an example of that scenario was the varroa bee mite. We had only one bee scientist at the time, and the disease was endemic in New Zealand before it was recognised. It is vital that we have a complement of scientists who are competent and capable in the various biotechnology techniques involved with genetics, in order to be able to pick up on things at the time and also to be able to use the huge power of the new genetics and genomics to the betterment of New Zealand. There is no doubt that in areas such as agriculture and horticulture it is vital, but also it is vital in the area of medicine. Yet we have seen this Government putting on a blanket stop, using the crudest and only method it knows—that is, a moratorium. In the order of six cases of xenotransplantation have been carried out in New Zealand, until the abrupt stop was put to it by Labour and the Greens. I note that there was an application going through the process—a fairly stiff regulatory process that we had in New Zealand at the time—but it was turned down by an amendment of this Labour Government. As it turned out, Mai Chen, a very well-known lawyer, and a submitter to the select committee at the time, believed that the Supplementary Order Paper brought in by this Government was literally a constitutional outrage. The firm Diatranz did not even have the opportunity to have its application heard. It is extraordinary that only last week it was revealed in the newspapers that one of the individuals who had a transplant of pig islet cells intra-abdominally by way of laparoscope had, of his own volition, a further laparoscopy in February this year. It was fascinating to hear that the islet cells were still producing insulin. He was thrilled by it. The scientific community was thrilled by it, but it has been deeply disturbed by the fact that right around the world other such cases have been replicated and are showing huge promise. The major problem this Government was worried about was the pig endogenous retrovirus, which is inherent in the line of cells that was being used. We heard last week in Parliament, through the Royal Society lectures on science, that there is now a pig islet cell strain that is free of the retrovirus, giving huge hope for this area. We also heard from Dr Bruce Scoggins, the chief executive officer of the Health Research Council of New Zealand. He now says that there is undoubtedly a place for xenotransplantation in New Zealand. There is no reason why we should not at least have the opportunity for people to apply for xenotransplantation experiments in New Zealand, where we do have a very rigorous regulatory regime, so that at least we can get in place the decision as to whether the risk management is appropriate. But this Government has said that it is not interested in science; it will just put down a blank, blunt instrument. I can see members of the Government over there shaking their heads. This is the Government that says it is interested in economic growth, in biotechnology, and in moving New Zealand along—and what does it do? It puts in place massive hurdles that have prohibited progress in one of the most potentially important areas for New Zealand, and the recent Huntington’s chorea trail is not the only example of that. There was—I think it was in 2001—the AgResearch application for transgenic cows. That in itself cost AgResearch something like $600,000 and took 2 years before it was finally able to get on with it. Again, the Government has unnecessarily placed a huge inherent hurdle on New Zealand science, almost certainly because it has listened to the Greens, taken notice, and taken an absolutely Luddite approach to an area that is so important for New Zealand. There is no doubt that the technology here is innovative, clever, and can be used for a whole variety of reasons. There is no doubt that New Zealand should be at the forefront of this sort of innovative, clever biotechnology. The very wrong thing to do is to put in a moratorium. One would hope that any Government that professes to be interested in the knowledge economy would at least put in place a regime whereby any applicant can go through a rigorous risk management process and then have the experts decide—not politicians such as this Labour Government has produced—whether this very important technology can occur in New Zealand. What happened to Diatranz? It had to go offshore—it literally went to Australia. I accept the fact that the Australians have also had a somewhat Luddite approach to their regulatory regime in this particular instance. But in a vast variety of other areas, their regime around biotechnology and genomic research is much more enlightened than what we have seen under this Labour Government. That is why many of our scientists are going over there. That is why the Huntington’s chorea trial has gone to Adelaide, and that is why I am saying that this particular moratorium is totally unnecessary and an indictment on the Labour Government. STEVE CHADWICK (Labour—Rotorua) : I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am appalled, actually, at the rather arrogant attitude of the Opposition spokesman on health. The moratorium in this bill is very clear. If the member had listened to the Minister, he would know that the provisions that allow for the extension of the moratorium for 1 year are for two reasons—and the member needs to listen to this. The provisions here for xenotransplantation will be covered under the Human Tissue Bill, which is yet to be referred to the Health Committee. Also, we want to conclude the consultation from the Bioethics Council. It is for those two reasons alone that we seek an extension to the current moratorium. I support this bill and I know that the member for the Opposition realises that it was incredibly important that we set up the Bioethics Council. It would be disgusting to pre-empt any decision just because they are scientists and just because this technology is sorely needed, and not go through the consultation under the Bioethics Council. We are a Government that is prepared to wait. The scientific research is going on overseas, and for that reason I support this bill. DAIL JONES (NZ First) : I rise on behalf of New Zealand First. We have had a very interesting debate from all parties. As far New Zealand First is concerned, we will support the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill going to the Health Committee. Quite obviously, a high-powered debate is being undertaken at technological levels. We recognise that biotechnology is one of the most important economic aspects for New Zealand’s future, and we must be involved in the biotechnology economy. This is a relatively short bill and the matter can be considered by the select committee relatively quickly. We look forward to all those interested parties making submissions to the select committee, and New Zealand First will take note of what they have to say. So in the meantime, we support the bill going to the select committee. KATHERINE RICH (National) : The National Party, as my colleague said, will not support the bill because we do not see the need for a moratorium. We believe that we already know a lot about the science, and that this is a very blunt attempt to hold back the sea. The Government can pretend all it likes to be King Canute, but science will continue to progress and to provide solutions for many New Zealand families that are waiting for xenotransplantation technologies to be developed and to be available here. We have seen Willie Terpstra and her family go offshore to get the treatment she could not get here. Many New Zealanders watched that story and saw how much that technology made a difference to that New Zealander’s life. Who are we to stand in the way of that? Four members of my family have been on renal dialysis. Three of them have had transplants, and one is currently waiting for a transplant. I can tell members on the Government side of the House that if the technology existed to transplant a pig kidney, a baboon kidney, or any kind of kidney that would keep my family member alive and off renal dialysis, then that would be fine by me. We need to remember the human face of this argument. Labour can pontificate about the cultural issues and sensitivities, yet people are waiting for life-changing treatments. We need to trust the scientists, who are very careful, sensible, and ethical in the work that they have done and are doing. We know that the moratorium will not stop the work being done. It will just send our scientists offshore so that the work can be done there. Is it any wonder that we are seeing a brain drain of scientists right now? There are simply too many hurdles and barriers in their way when it comes to New Zealand science to do leading-edge work. There is no logic behind this decision. There is no reasoning or detailed scientific analysis for the extension of this moratorium. In fact, there is no indication that it will work at all, except to shut down an area of work and opportunity in New Zealand, when a lot of New Zealand families are waiting for the technologies that can arise as a result of this kind of work. It was interesting to hear the member opposite talk about arrogance. I think it is arrogance to stand in the way of some life-saving technologies that can make a difference to some New Zealanders’ lives. Unless one is in that situation and really knows what it is like to face those sorts of family difficulties, one does not know what one is talking about when pontificating about cultural sensitivities. I have had a look at some of the work put out by the Bioethics Council, and I have to say that it is an absolute load of tripe. Constituents of mine have been involved in the consultation process in Dunedin, and have been subjected to handholding exercises where people ask questions about what happens if someone takes on a pig kidney and suddenly starts to behave like a pig. That is absolute rubbish. There is no scientific base to that sort of discussion. There is no knowledge or detailed understanding of this extremely high-tech scientific area. So I think that holding back the tide here does not do the best for New Zealanders. It does not do the best for the many Kiwi families who are waiting for all sorts of solutions to very many debilitating diseases and health conditions that keep people from living full and active lives. It is very easy, I think, for the Government to bring up some basically extremely spurious reasons why this moratorium should be continued, but there is no logic to it. There is no reason or scientific base. I do not think the Government has listened to a lot of the groups—the patients and the families—who are waiting for some of these lifesaving techniques and technologies. I worry that so many of our best scientists are going offshore. There are a lot of areas where one cannot do leading-edge research now, because of the regulations and hurdles that have been put in place. The scientists in those areas have brains that are easily exportable. They can go offshore and get better salaries and greater continuity in their incomes and careers, rather than stay here and see artificial barriers put in place that disallow them from doing good scientific work. I do not think there are any mad scientists in New Zealand. There is a group of scientists who want to do some studies in an area that I think will make a huge difference to the lives of a lot of New Zealanders. Hon Maurice Williamson: A lot of them are under stress, though. KATHERINE RICH: My colleague says that some are under stress. That is no surprise. I think some members opposite wish that John Tamihere would be xenotransplanted into another party. But as he says that he will die a Labour man, despite apparently humbling himself before the caucus today—although he does not retract any of his comments—it seems that that will not be the case either, so they should think about putting a moratorium on John Tamihere. That might do them a better service than trying to put up artificial barriers that will just cause loss of life and remove opportunities for New Zealanders to have access to some of these technologies that will make a difference to their lives. Darren Hughes: Is this the same woman who got sacked? KATHERINE RICH: Until Darren Hughes faces a parent on dialysis or a family member who is looking for a transplant of some kind, he should keep his mouth shut because he has no idea what it is like. He can pontificate about the cultural sensitivities of xenotransplantation, but just wait until he sees a dialysis patient in his constituency office, who says: “Your rules are standing between me having a life and not being able to continue.” Then, I think, he might change his tune—once he understands the human face of these decisions. The Government is trying to hold back the tide of science. It is quite Luddite to pretend that science will stop its work in this area. It is only New Zealand that will stop work in this area, while the rest of the world will continue to provide opportunities for science. Science will march on and provide some life-giving solutions to a lot of people who are waiting for these opportunities—who are waiting for the second chance at life that might come from a pig kidney, a pig liver, or some other transplanted organ. So it is all very well for members opposite to be theoretical about this moratorium and pretend that it will not have an impact. We know that it will. Many, many New Zealanders will be worse off because the Labour Government thinks it can hold back the scientific tide and deny a lot of New Zealanders many lifesaving solutions that will make a difference to their lives and allow them to continue—if, of course, we have any scientists to continue this work once this moratorium is over. As we know, not many scientists who go to the United States or to the UK make the transition back into New Zealand.

Hon ANNETTE KING (Minister of Health) : I move, That the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill be now read a first time. At the appropriate time I will move that the bill be referred to the Health Committee for consideration, that the committee present its final report on or before 28 May 2005, and that the committee have the authority to meet at any time while the House is sitting, except during oral questions, and during any evening on a day on which there has been a sitting of the House, and on a Friday in a week in which there has been a sitting of the House, despite Standing Orders 191 and 194(1)(b) and (c). Xenotransplantation is the implantation of living biological material from animals into humans. The Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill extends the period of the current controls on xenotransplantation until 31 December 2006, with the ability for this state to be extended by Order in Council if necessary. The current controls were introduced in response to concerns about the potential of threats of xenotransplants transmitting new infections to recipients and to the wider community; the adequacy of regulatory review processes; and the cultural, social, and ethical issues associated with xenotransplantation. The current controls allow xenotransplantation trials to be considered and approved by the Minister of Health but require strict criteria to be met before an approval is given. No applications have been made to the Minister of Health under the current provisions. Without this bill, the existing additional controls on xenotransplantation will end on 30 June 2005 with the expiry of Part 7A of the Medicines Act. After this state the scientific and ethical oversight will return to the controls utilised for clinical trials of medicines contained in section 30 of the Medicines Act. Section 30 controls were previously identified as being inadequate, and, despite further information on xenotransplantation being published, I am advised there is still a need for additional oversight of this controversial emerging technology. Existing controls cannot be extended further under existing legislation, hence the need for this bill. Ongoing controls are needed on xenotransplantation because it is still only an experimental technique. It is unclear whether this technique would be successful within humans. There is also a risk of transmitting viruses from animals to humans. There are only a small number of animal or human studies of possible efficacy, and it is far from clear whether a transplanted animal organ would function properly in a human. Evidence indicates that xenotransplantation may be associated with an increased risk of transmission of a wide range of viral, bacterial, and other infections known to occur in the sourced animals. There is a theoretical risk that xenotransplantation could increase the risk of new infections jumping the species barrier from animals to humans. In view of concerns about the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation, similar jurisdictions—including Australia, Canada, and the UK—have stringent controls on xenotransplantation. To my knowledge there are currently no clinical trials under way in those countries. In December 2004 the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council announced a 5-year moratorium on clinical trials of xenotransplantation. New Zealand would be going out on a limb if we allowed these controls to lapse. I commend this bill to the House. Dr PAUL HUTCHISON (National—Port Waikato) : Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this very important bill, the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill. Opposition Members: This is the next Minister of Health! Dr PAUL HUTCHISON: Those members are absolutely right. This bill is a serious indictment on this Labour Government’s integrity and its attitude towards science. In essence, this bill is the continuation of a blunt instrument that the Labour Government put on science in order to stop xenotransplantation in New Zealand back in 2001—now the Government wants to continue it until 2006. This bill is a serious indictment on Labour. The Prime Minister, her health Minister, and her science Minister all say they are committed to science and are committed to economic growth. We have a classic situation in which they have said: “Let’s focus on biotechnology as one of the main strands of economic growth in New Zealand.”, yet they have created in this country some of the most difficult hurdles to the carrying out of biotechnology in the Western World. We know that the Government’s own biotechnology task force has said exactly that—that the regulatory regime in New Zealand is very difficult and that it is forcing top New Zealand scientists to do their work overseas or to leave. I shall give two examples. The first is the Huntington’s chorea trial that was, basically, founded at the Auckland School of Medicine. The reason it did not continue in New Zealand was that it cost too much and would take too long. Consequently, it has gone to Adelaide. That is a tragedy for New Zealand science, a tragedy for New Zealand biotechnology. It is hugely important to have a complement of scientists in New Zealand who are capable in the new genetics. If we do not, we will not even recognise the problems until they have got here, and an example of that scenario was the varroa bee mite. We had only one bee scientist at the time, and the disease was endemic in New Zealand before it was recognised. It is vital that we have a complement of scientists who are competent and capable in the various biotechnology techniques involved with genetics, in order to be able to pick up on things at the time and also to be able to use the huge power of the new genetics and genomics to the betterment of New Zealand. There is no doubt that in areas such as agriculture and horticulture it is vital, but also it is vital in the area of medicine. Yet we have seen this Government putting on a blanket stop, using the crudest and only method it knows—that is, a moratorium. In the order of six cases of xenotransplantation have been carried out in New Zealand, until the abrupt stop was put to it by Labour and the Greens. I note that there was an application going through the process—a fairly stiff regulatory process that we had in New Zealand at the time—but it was turned down by an amendment of this Labour Government. As it turned out, Mai Chen, a very well-known lawyer, and a submitter to the select committee at the time, believed that the Supplementary Order Paper brought in by this Government was literally a constitutional outrage. The firm Diatranz did not even have the opportunity to have its application heard. It is extraordinary that only last week it was revealed in the newspapers that one of the individuals who had a transplant of pig islet cells intra-abdominally by way of laparoscope had, of his own volition, a further laparoscopy in February this year. It was fascinating to hear that the islet cells were still producing insulin. He was thrilled by it. The scientific community was thrilled by it, but it has been deeply disturbed by the fact that right around the world other such cases have been replicated and are showing huge promise. The major problem this Government was worried about was the pig endogenous retrovirus, which is inherent in the line of cells that was being used. We heard last week in Parliament, through the Royal Society lectures on science, that there is now a pig islet cell strain that is free of the retrovirus, giving huge hope for this area. We also heard from Dr Bruce Scoggins, the chief executive officer of the Health Research Council of New Zealand. He now says that there is undoubtedly a place for xenotransplantation in New Zealand. There is no reason why we should not at least have the opportunity for people to apply for xenotransplantation experiments in New Zealand, where we do have a very rigorous regulatory regime, so that at least we can get in place the decision as to whether the risk management is appropriate. But this Government has said that it is not interested in science; it will just put down a blank, blunt instrument. I can see members of the Government over there shaking their heads. This is the Government that says it is interested in economic growth, in biotechnology, and in moving New Zealand along—and what does it do? It puts in place massive hurdles that have prohibited progress in one of the most potentially important areas for New Zealand, and the recent Huntington’s chorea trail is not the only example of that. There was—I think it was in 2001—the AgResearch application for transgenic cows. That in itself cost AgResearch something like $600,000 and took 2 years before it was finally able to get on with it. Again, the Government has unnecessarily placed a huge inherent hurdle on New Zealand science, almost certainly because it has listened to the Greens, taken notice, and taken an absolutely Luddite approach to an area that is so important for New Zealand. There is no doubt that the technology here is innovative, clever, and can be used for a whole variety of reasons. There is no doubt that New Zealand should be at the forefront of this sort of innovative, clever biotechnology. The very wrong thing to do is to put in a moratorium. One would hope that any Government that professes to be interested in the knowledge economy would at least put in place a regime whereby any applicant can go through a rigorous risk management process and then have the experts decide—not politicians such as this Labour Government has produced—whether this very important technology can occur in New Zealand. What happened to Diatranz? It had to go offshore—it literally went to Australia. I accept the fact that the Australians have also had a somewhat Luddite approach to their regulatory regime in this particular instance. But in a vast variety of other areas, their regime around biotechnology and genomic research is much more enlightened than what we have seen under this Labour Government. That is why many of our scientists are going over there. That is why the Huntington’s chorea trial has gone to Adelaide, and that is why I am saying that this particular moratorium is totally unnecessary and an indictment on the Labour Government. STEVE CHADWICK (Labour—Rotorua) : I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am appalled, actually, at the rather arrogant attitude of the Opposition spokesman on health. The moratorium in this bill is very clear. If the member had listened to the Minister, he would know that the provisions that allow for the extension of the moratorium for 1 year are for two reasons—and the member needs to listen to this. The provisions here for xenotransplantation will be covered under the Human Tissue Bill, which is yet to be referred to the Health Committee. Also, we want to conclude the consultation from the Bioethics Council. It is for those two reasons alone that we seek an extension to the current moratorium. I support this bill and I know that the member for the Opposition realises that it was incredibly important that we set up the Bioethics Council. It would be disgusting to pre-empt any decision just because they are scientists and just because this technology is sorely needed, and not go through the consultation under the Bioethics Council. We are a Government that is prepared to wait. The scientific research is going on overseas, and for that reason I support this bill. DAIL JONES (NZ First) : I rise on behalf of New Zealand First. We have had a very interesting debate from all parties. As far New Zealand First is concerned, we will support the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill going to the Health Committee. Quite obviously, a high-powered debate is being undertaken at technological levels. We recognise that biotechnology is one of the most important economic aspects for New Zealand’s future, and we must be involved in the biotechnology economy. This is a relatively short bill and the matter can be considered by the select committee relatively quickly. We look forward to all those interested parties making submissions to the select committee, and New Zealand First will take note of what they have to say. So in the meantime, we support the bill going to the select committee. KATHERINE RICH (National) : The National Party, as my colleague said, will not support the bill because we do not see the need for a moratorium. We believe that we already know a lot about the science, and that this is a very blunt attempt to hold back the sea. The Government can pretend all it likes to be King Canute, but science will continue to progress and to provide solutions for many New Zealand families that are waiting for xenotransplantation technologies to be developed and to be available here. We have seen Willie Terpstra and her family go offshore to get the treatment she could not get here. Many New Zealanders watched that story and saw how much that technology made a difference to that New Zealander’s life. Who are we to stand in the way of that? Four members of my family have been on renal dialysis. Three of them have had transplants, and one is currently waiting for a transplant. I can tell members on the Government side of the House that if the technology existed to transplant a pig kidney, a baboon kidney, or any kind of kidney that would keep my family member alive and off renal dialysis, then that would be fine by me. We need to remember the human face of this argument. Labour can pontificate about the cultural issues and sensitivities, yet people are waiting for life-changing treatments. We need to trust the scientists, who are very careful, sensible, and ethical in the work that they have done and are doing. We know that the moratorium will not stop the work being done. It will just send our scientists offshore so that the work can be done there. Is it any wonder that we are seeing a brain drain of scientists right now? There are simply too many hurdles and barriers in their way when it comes to New Zealand science to do leading-edge work. There is no logic behind this decision. There is no reasoning or detailed scientific analysis for the extension of this moratorium. In fact, there is no indication that it will work at all, except to shut down an area of work and opportunity in New Zealand, when a lot of New Zealand families are waiting for the technologies that can arise as a result of this kind of work. It was interesting to hear the member opposite talk about arrogance. I think it is arrogance to stand in the way of some life-saving technologies that can make a difference to some New Zealanders’ lives. Unless one is in that situation and really knows what it is like to face those sorts of family difficulties, one does not know what one is talking about when pontificating about cultural sensitivities. I have had a look at some of the work put out by the Bioethics Council, and I have to say that it is an absolute load of tripe. Constituents of mine have been involved in the consultation process in Dunedin, and have been subjected to handholding exercises where people ask questions about what happens if someone takes on a pig kidney and suddenly starts to behave like a pig. That is absolute rubbish. There is no scientific base to that sort of discussion. There is no knowledge or detailed understanding of this extremely high-tech scientific area. So I think that holding back the tide here does not do the best for New Zealanders. It does not do the best for the many Kiwi families who are waiting for all sorts of solutions to very many debilitating diseases and health conditions that keep people from living full and active lives. It is very easy, I think, for the Government to bring up some basically extremely spurious reasons why this moratorium should be continued, but there is no logic to it. There is no reason or scientific base. I do not think the Government has listened to a lot of the groups—the patients and the families—who are waiting for some of these lifesaving techniques and technologies. I worry that so many of our best scientists are going offshore. There are a lot of areas where one cannot do leading-edge research now, because of the regulations and hurdles that have been put in place. The scientists in those areas have brains that are easily exportable. They can go offshore and get better salaries and greater continuity in their incomes and careers, rather than stay here and see artificial barriers put in place that disallow them from doing good scientific work. I do not think there are any mad scientists in New Zealand. There is a group of scientists who want to do some studies in an area that I think will make a huge difference to the lives of a lot of New Zealanders. Hon Maurice Williamson: A lot of them are under stress, though. KATHERINE RICH: My colleague says that some are under stress. That is no surprise. I think some members opposite wish that John Tamihere would be xenotransplanted into another party. But as he says that he will die a Labour man, despite apparently humbling himself before the caucus today—although he does not retract any of his comments—it seems that that will not be the case either, so they should think about putting a moratorium on John Tamihere. That might do them a better service than trying to put up artificial barriers that will just cause loss of life and remove opportunities for New Zealanders to have access to some of these technologies that will make a difference to their lives. Darren Hughes: Is this the same woman who got sacked? KATHERINE RICH: Until Darren Hughes faces a parent on dialysis or a family member who is looking for a transplant of some kind, he should keep his mouth shut because he has no idea what it is like. He can pontificate about the cultural sensitivities of xenotransplantation, but just wait until he sees a dialysis patient in his constituency office, who says: “Your rules are standing between me having a life and not being able to continue.” Then, I think, he might change his tune—once he understands the human face of these decisions. The Government is trying to hold back the tide of science. It is quite Luddite to pretend that science will stop its work in this area. It is only New Zealand that will stop work in this area, while the rest of the world will continue to provide opportunities for science. Science will march on and provide some life-giving solutions to a lot of people who are waiting for these opportunities—who are waiting for the second chance at life that might come from a pig kidney, a pig liver, or some other transplanted organ. So it is all very well for members opposite to be theoretical about this moratorium and pretend that it will not have an impact. We know that it will. Many, many New Zealanders will be worse off because the Labour Government thinks it can hold back the scientific tide and deny a lot of New Zealanders many lifesaving solutions that will make a difference to their lives and allow them to continue—if, of course, we have any scientists to continue this work once this moratorium is over. As we know, not many scientists who go to the United States or to the UK make the transition back into New Zealand. A few have, but not many come back once they get used to research grants, good salaries, better conditions, continuity in their work, and better opportunities. We are worse off because we lose those brains—those people who could do a huge amount of work within our Crown research institutes here in New Zealand.",summarize the following text: ,"Xenotransplantation is the implantation of living biological material from animals into humans The Bill extends controls on xenotransplantation This  is a serious indictment on this Government’s attitude towards science this bill is the instrument the Government put on science to stop xenotransplantation it is forcing top New Zealand scientists to do their work overseas It is hugely important to have a complement of scientists who are capable in the new genetics.

It will just send our scientists offshore so that the work can be done there. Is it any wonder that we are seeing a brain drain of scientists right now? There are simply too many hurdles and barriers in their way when it comes to New Zealand science to do leading-edge work. There is no logic behind this decision. There is no reasoning or detailed scientific analysis for the extension of this moratorium. In fact, there is no indication that it will work at all, except to shut down an area of work and opportunity in New Zealand, when a lot of New Zealand families are waiting for the technologies that can arise as a result of this kind of work. It was interesting to hear the member opposite talk about arrogance. I think it is arrogance to stand in the way of some life-saving technologies that can make a difference to some New Zealanders’ lives. Unless one is in that situation and really knows what it is like to face those sorts of family difficulties, one does not know what one is talking about when pontificating about cultural sensitivities. I have had a look at some of the work put out by the Bioethics Council, and I have to say that it is an absolute load of tripe. Constituents of mine have been involved in the consultation process in Dunedin, and have been subjected to handholding exercises where people ask questions about what happens if someone takes on a pig kidney and suddenly starts to behave like a pig. That is absolute rubbish. There is no scientific base to that sort of discussion. There is no knowledge or detailed understanding of this extremely high-tech scientific area. So I think that holding back the tide here does not do the best for New Zealanders. It does not do the best for the many Kiwi families who are waiting for all sorts of solutions to very many debilitating diseases and health conditions that keep people from living full and active lives. It is very easy, I think, for the Government to bring up some basically extremely spurious reasons why this moratorium should be continued, but there is no logic to it. There is no reason or scientific base. I do not think the Government has listened to a lot of the groups—the patients and the families—who are waiting for some of these lifesaving techniques and technologies. I worry that so many of our best scientists are going offshore. There are a lot of areas where one cannot do leading-edge research now, because of the regulations and hurdles that have been put in place. The scientists in those areas have brains that are easily exportable. They can go offshore and get better salaries and greater continuity in their incomes and careers, rather than stay here and see artificial barriers put in place that disallow them from doing good scientific work. I do not think there are any mad scientists in New Zealand. There is a group of scientists who want to do some studies in an area that I think will make a huge difference to the lives of a lot of New Zealanders. Hon Maurice Williamson: A lot of them are under stress, though. KATHERINE RICH: My colleague says that some are under stress. That is no surprise. I think some members opposite wish that John Tamihere would be xenotransplanted into another party. But as he says that he will die a Labour man, despite apparently humbling himself before the caucus today—although he does not retract any of his comments—it seems that that will not be the case either, so they should think about putting a moratorium on John Tamihere. That might do them a better service than trying to put up artificial barriers that will just cause loss of life and remove opportunities for New Zealanders to have access to some of these technologies that will make a difference to their lives. Darren Hughes: Is this the same woman who got sacked? KATHERINE RICH: Until Darren Hughes faces a parent on dialysis or a family member who is looking for a transplant of some kind, he should keep his mouth shut because he has no idea what it is like. He can pontificate about the cultural sensitivities of xenotransplantation, but just wait until he sees a dialysis patient in his constituency office, who says: “Your rules are standing between me having a life and not being able to continue.” Then, I think, he might change his tune—once he understands the human face of these decisions. The Government is trying to hold back the tide of science. It is quite Luddite to pretend that science will stop its work in this area. It is only New Zealand that will stop work in this area, while the rest of the world will continue to provide opportunities for science. Science will march on and provide some life-giving solutions to a lot of people who are waiting for these opportunities—who are waiting for the second chance at life that might come from a pig kidney, a pig liver, or some other transplanted organ. So it is all very well for members opposite to be theoretical about this moratorium and pretend that it will not have an impact. We know that it will. Many, many New Zealanders will be worse off because the Labour Government thinks it can hold back the scientific tide and deny a lot of New Zealanders many lifesaving solutions that will make a difference to their lives and allow them to continue—if, of course, we have any scientists to continue this work once this moratorium is over. As we know, not many scientists who go to the United States or to the UK make the transition back into New Zealand. A few have, but not many come back once they get used to research grants, good salaries, better conditions, continuity in their work, and better opportunities. We are worse off because we lose those brains—those people who could do a huge amount of work within our Crown research institutes here in New Zealand.",summarize the following text: ,"Xenotransplantation is the implantation of living biological material from animals into humans The Bill extends controls on xenotransplantation This  is a serious indictment on this Government’s attitude towards science this bill is the instrument the Government put on science to stop xenotransplantation it is forcing top New Zealand scientists to do their work overseas It is hugely important to have a complement of scientists who are capable in the new genetics.

Hon ANNETTE KING (Minister of Health) : I move, That the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill be now read a first time. At the appropriate time I will move that the bill be referred to the Health Committee for consideration, that the committee present its final report on or before 28 May 2005, and that the committee have the authority to meet at any time while the House is sitting, except during oral questions, and during any evening on a day on which there has been a sitting of the House, and on a Friday in a week in which there has been a sitting of the House, despite Standing Orders 191 and 194(1)(b) and (c). Xenotransplantation is the implantation of living biological material from animals into humans. The Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill extends the period of the current controls on xenotransplantation until 31 December 2006, with the ability for this state to be extended by Order in Council if necessary. The current controls were introduced in response to concerns about the potential of threats of xenotransplants transmitting new infections to recipients and to the wider community; the adequacy of regulatory review processes; and the cultural, social, and ethical issues associated with xenotransplantation. The current controls allow xenotransplantation trials to be considered and approved by the Minister of Health but require strict criteria to be met before an approval is given. No applications have been made to the Minister of Health under the current provisions. Without this bill, the existing additional controls on xenotransplantation will end on 30 June 2005 with the expiry of Part 7A of the Medicines Act. After this state the scientific and ethical oversight will return to the controls utilised for clinical trials of medicines contained in section 30 of the Medicines Act. Section 30 controls were previously identified as being inadequate, and, despite further information on xenotransplantation being published, I am advised there is still a need for additional oversight of this controversial emerging technology. Existing controls cannot be extended further under existing legislation, hence the need for this bill. Ongoing controls are needed on xenotransplantation because it is still only an experimental technique. It is unclear whether this technique would be successful within humans. There is also a risk of transmitting viruses from animals to humans. There are only a small number of animal or human studies of possible efficacy, and it is far from clear whether a transplanted animal organ would function properly in a human. Evidence indicates that xenotransplantation may be associated with an increased risk of transmission of a wide range of viral, bacterial, and other infections known to occur in the sourced animals. There is a theoretical risk that xenotransplantation could increase the risk of new infections jumping the species barrier from animals to humans. In view of concerns about the safety and efficacy of xenotransplantation, similar jurisdictions—including Australia, Canada, and the UK—have stringent controls on xenotransplantation. To my knowledge there are currently no clinical trials under way in those countries. In December 2004 the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council announced a 5-year moratorium on clinical trials of xenotransplantation. New Zealand would be going out on a limb if we allowed these controls to lapse. I commend this bill to the House. Dr PAUL HUTCHISON (National—Port Waikato) : Thank you for the opportunity to speak to this very important bill, the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill. Opposition Members: This is the next Minister of Health! Dr PAUL HUTCHISON: Those members are absolutely right. This bill is a serious indictment on this Labour Government’s integrity and its attitude towards science. In essence, this bill is the continuation of a blunt instrument that the Labour Government put on science in order to stop xenotransplantation in New Zealand back in 2001—now the Government wants to continue it until 2006. This bill is a serious indictment on Labour. The Prime Minister, her health Minister, and her science Minister all say they are committed to science and are committed to economic growth. We have a classic situation in which they have said: “Let’s focus on biotechnology as one of the main strands of economic growth in New Zealand.”, yet they have created in this country some of the most difficult hurdles to the carrying out of biotechnology in the Western World. We know that the Government’s own biotechnology task force has said exactly that—that the regulatory regime in New Zealand is very difficult and that it is forcing top New Zealand scientists to do their work overseas or to leave. I shall give two examples. The first is the Huntington’s chorea trial that was, basically, founded at the Auckland School of Medicine. The reason it did not continue in New Zealand was that it cost too much and would take too long. Consequently, it has gone to Adelaide. That is a tragedy for New Zealand science, a tragedy for New Zealand biotechnology. It is hugely important to have a complement of scientists in New Zealand who are capable in the new genetics. If we do not, we will not even recognise the problems until they have got here, and an example of that scenario was the varroa bee mite. We had only one bee scientist at the time, and the disease was endemic in New Zealand before it was recognised. It is vital that we have a complement of scientists who are competent and capable in the various biotechnology techniques involved with genetics, in order to be able to pick up on things at the time and also to be able to use the huge power of the new genetics and genomics to the betterment of New Zealand. There is no doubt that in areas such as agriculture and horticulture it is vital, but also it is vital in the area of medicine. Yet we have seen this Government putting on a blanket stop, using the crudest and only method it knows—that is, a moratorium. In the order of six cases of xenotransplantation have been carried out in New Zealand, until the abrupt stop was put to it by Labour and the Greens. I note that there was an application going through the process—a fairly stiff regulatory process that we had in New Zealand at the time—but it was turned down by an amendment of this Labour Government. As it turned out, Mai Chen, a very well-known lawyer, and a submitter to the select committee at the time, believed that the Supplementary Order Paper brought in by this Government was literally a constitutional outrage. The firm Diatranz did not even have the opportunity to have its application heard. It is extraordinary that only last week it was revealed in the newspapers that one of the individuals who had a transplant of pig islet cells intra-abdominally by way of laparoscope had, of his own volition, a further laparoscopy in February this year. It was fascinating to hear that the islet cells were still producing insulin. He was thrilled by it. The scientific community was thrilled by it, but it has been deeply disturbed by the fact that right around the world other such cases have been replicated and are showing huge promise. The major problem this Government was worried about was the pig endogenous retrovirus, which is inherent in the line of cells that was being used. We heard last week in Parliament, through the Royal Society lectures on science, that there is now a pig islet cell strain that is free of the retrovirus, giving huge hope for this area. We also heard from Dr Bruce Scoggins, the chief executive officer of the Health Research Council of New Zealand. He now says that there is undoubtedly a place for xenotransplantation in New Zealand. There is no reason why we should not at least have the opportunity for people to apply for xenotransplantation experiments in New Zealand, where we do have a very rigorous regulatory regime, so that at least we can get in place the decision as to whether the risk management is appropriate. But this Government has said that it is not interested in science; it will just put down a blank, blunt instrument. I can see members of the Government over there shaking their heads. This is the Government that says it is interested in economic growth, in biotechnology, and in moving New Zealand along—and what does it do? It puts in place massive hurdles that have prohibited progress in one of the most potentially important areas for New Zealand, and the recent Huntington’s chorea trail is not the only example of that. There was—I think it was in 2001—the AgResearch application for transgenic cows. That in itself cost AgResearch something like $600,000 and took 2 years before it was finally able to get on with it. Again, the Government has unnecessarily placed a huge inherent hurdle on New Zealand science, almost certainly because it has listened to the Greens, taken notice, and taken an absolutely Luddite approach to an area that is so important for New Zealand. There is no doubt that the technology here is innovative, clever, and can be used for a whole variety of reasons. There is no doubt that New Zealand should be at the forefront of this sort of innovative, clever biotechnology. The very wrong thing to do is to put in a moratorium. One would hope that any Government that professes to be interested in the knowledge economy would at least put in place a regime whereby any applicant can go through a rigorous risk management process and then have the experts decide—not politicians such as this Labour Government has produced—whether this very important technology can occur in New Zealand. What happened to Diatranz? It had to go offshore—it literally went to Australia. I accept the fact that the Australians have also had a somewhat Luddite approach to their regulatory regime in this particular instance. But in a vast variety of other areas, their regime around biotechnology and genomic research is much more enlightened than what we have seen under this Labour Government. That is why many of our scientists are going over there. That is why the Huntington’s chorea trial has gone to Adelaide, and that is why I am saying that this particular moratorium is totally unnecessary and an indictment on the Labour Government. STEVE CHADWICK (Labour—Rotorua) : I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am appalled, actually, at the rather arrogant attitude of the Opposition spokesman on health. The moratorium in this bill is very clear. If the member had listened to the Minister, he would know that the provisions that allow for the extension of the moratorium for 1 year are for two reasons—and the member needs to listen to this. The provisions here for xenotransplantation will be covered under the Human Tissue Bill, which is yet to be referred to the Health Committee. Also, we want to conclude the consultation from the Bioethics Council. It is for those two reasons alone that we seek an extension to the current moratorium. I support this bill and I know that the member for the Opposition realises that it was incredibly important that we set up the Bioethics Council. It would be disgusting to pre-empt any decision just because they are scientists and just because this technology is sorely needed, and not go through the consultation under the Bioethics Council. We are a Government that is prepared to wait. The scientific research is going on overseas, and for that reason I support this bill. DAIL JONES (NZ First) : I rise on behalf of New Zealand First. We have had a very interesting debate from all parties. As far New Zealand First is concerned, we will support the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill going to the Health Committee. Quite obviously, a high-powered debate is being undertaken at technological levels. We recognise that biotechnology is one of the most important economic aspects for New Zealand’s future, and we must be involved in the biotechnology economy. This is a relatively short bill and the matter can be considered by the select committee relatively quickly. We look forward to all those interested parties making submissions to the select committee, and New Zealand First will take note of what they have to say. So in the meantime, we support the bill going to the select committee. KATHERINE RICH (National) : The National Party, as my colleague said, will not support the bill because we do not see the need for a moratorium. We believe that we already know a lot about the science, and that this is a very blunt attempt to hold back the sea. The Government can pretend all it likes to be King Canute, but science will continue to progress and to provide solutions for many New Zealand families that are waiting for xenotransplantation technologies to be developed and to be available here. We have seen Willie Terpstra and her family go offshore to get the treatment she could not get here. Many New Zealanders watched that story and saw how much that technology made a difference to that New Zealander’s life. Who are we to stand in the way of that? Four members of my family have been on renal dialysis. Three of them have had transplants, and one is currently waiting for a transplant. I can tell members on the Government side of the House that if the technology existed to transplant a pig kidney, a baboon kidney, or any kind of kidney that would keep my family member alive and off renal dialysis, then that would be fine by me. We need to remember the human face of this argument. Labour can pontificate about the cultural issues and sensitivities, yet people are waiting for life-changing treatments. We need to trust the scientists, who are very careful, sensible, and ethical in the work that they have done and are doing. We know that the moratorium will not stop the work being done. It will just send our scientists offshore so that the work can be done there. Is it any wonder that we are seeing a brain drain of scientists right now? There are simply too many hurdles and barriers in their way when it comes to New Zealand science to do leading-edge work. There is no logic behind this decision.

This is the Government that says it is interested in economic growth, in biotechnology, and in moving New Zealand along—and what does it do? It puts in place massive hurdles that have prohibited progress in one of the most potentially important areas for New Zealand, and the recent Huntington’s chorea trail is not the only example of that. There was—I think it was in 2001—the AgResearch application for transgenic cows. That in itself cost AgResearch something like $600,000 and took 2 years before it was finally able to get on with it. Again, the Government has unnecessarily placed a huge inherent hurdle on New Zealand science, almost certainly because it has listened to the Greens, taken notice, and taken an absolutely Luddite approach to an area that is so important for New Zealand. There is no doubt that the technology here is innovative, clever, and can be used for a whole variety of reasons. There is no doubt that New Zealand should be at the forefront of this sort of innovative, clever biotechnology. The very wrong thing to do is to put in a moratorium. One would hope that any Government that professes to be interested in the knowledge economy would at least put in place a regime whereby any applicant can go through a rigorous risk management process and then have the experts decide—not politicians such as this Labour Government has produced—whether this very important technology can occur in New Zealand. What happened to Diatranz? It had to go offshore—it literally went to Australia. I accept the fact that the Australians have also had a somewhat Luddite approach to their regulatory regime in this particular instance. But in a vast variety of other areas, their regime around biotechnology and genomic research is much more enlightened than what we have seen under this Labour Government. That is why many of our scientists are going over there. That is why the Huntington’s chorea trial has gone to Adelaide, and that is why I am saying that this particular moratorium is totally unnecessary and an indictment on the Labour Government. STEVE CHADWICK (Labour—Rotorua) : I am pleased to speak on this bill. I am appalled, actually, at the rather arrogant attitude of the Opposition spokesman on health. The moratorium in this bill is very clear. If the member had listened to the Minister, he would know that the provisions that allow for the extension of the moratorium for 1 year are for two reasons—and the member needs to listen to this. The provisions here for xenotransplantation will be covered under the Human Tissue Bill, which is yet to be referred to the Health Committee. Also, we want to conclude the consultation from the Bioethics Council. It is for those two reasons alone that we seek an extension to the current moratorium. I support this bill and I know that the member for the Opposition realises that it was incredibly important that we set up the Bioethics Council. It would be disgusting to pre-empt any decision just because they are scientists and just because this technology is sorely needed, and not go through the consultation under the Bioethics Council. We are a Government that is prepared to wait. The scientific research is going on overseas, and for that reason I support this bill. DAIL JONES (NZ First) : I rise on behalf of New Zealand First. We have had a very interesting debate from all parties. As far New Zealand First is concerned, we will support the Medicines (Specified Biotechnical Procedures) Amendment Bill going to the Health Committee. Quite obviously, a high-powered debate is being undertaken at technological levels. We recognise that biotechnology is one of the most important economic aspects for New Zealand’s future, and we must be involved in the biotechnology economy. This is a relatively short bill and the matter can be considered by the select committee relatively quickly. We look forward to all those interested parties making submissions to the select committee, and New Zealand First will take note of what they have to say. So in the meantime, we support the bill going to the select committee. KATHERINE RICH (National) : The National Party, as my colleague said, will not support the bill because we do not see the need for a moratorium. We believe that we already know a lot about the science, and that this is a very blunt attempt to hold back the sea. The Government can pretend all it likes to be King Canute, but science will continue to progress and to provide solutions for many New Zealand families that are waiting for xenotransplantation technologies to be developed and to be available here. We have seen Willie Terpstra and her family go offshore to get the treatment she could not get here. Many New Zealanders watched that story and saw how much that technology made a difference to that New Zealander’s life. Who are we to stand in the way of that? Four members of my family have been on renal dialysis. Three of them have had transplants, and one is currently waiting for a transplant. I can tell members on the Government side of the House that if the technology existed to transplant a pig kidney, a baboon kidney, or any kind of kidney that would keep my family member alive and off renal dialysis, then that would be fine by me. We need to remember the human face of this argument. Labour can pontificate about the cultural issues and sensitivities, yet people are waiting for life-changing treatments. We need to trust the scientists, who are very careful, sensible, and ethical in the work that they have done and are doing. We know that the moratorium will not stop the work being done. It will just send our scientists offshore so that the work can be done there. Is it any wonder that we are seeing a brain drain of scientists right now? There are simply too many hurdles and barriers in their way when it comes to New Zealand science to do leading-edge work. There is no logic behind this decision. There is no reasoning or detailed scientific analysis for the extension of this moratorium. In fact, there is no indication that it will work at all, except to shut down an area of work and opportunity in New Zealand, when a lot of New Zealand families are waiting for the technologies that can arise as a result of this kind of work. It was interesting to hear the member opposite talk about arrogance. I think it is arrogance to stand in the way of some life-saving technologies that can make a difference to some New Zealanders’ lives. Unless one is in that situation and really knows what it is like to face those sorts of family difficulties, one does not know what one is talking about when pontificating about cultural sensitivities. I have had a look at some of the work put out by the Bioethics Council, and I have to say that it is an absolute load of tripe. Constituents of mine have been involved in the consultation process in Dunedin, and have been subjected to handholding exercises where people ask questions about what happens if someone takes on a pig kidney and suddenly starts to behave like a pig. That is absolute rubbish. There is no scientific base to that sort of discussion. There is no knowledge or detailed understanding of this extremely high-tech scientific area. So I think that holding back the tide here does not do the best for New Zealanders. It does not do the best for the many Kiwi families who are waiting for all sorts of solutions to very many debilitating diseases and health conditions that keep people from living full and active lives. It is very easy, I think, for the Government to bring up some basically extremely spurious reasons why this moratorium should be continued, but there is no logic to it. There is no reason or scientific base. I do not think the Government has listened to a lot of the groups—the patients and the families—who are waiting for some of these lifesaving techniques and technologies. I worry that so many of our best scientists are going offshore. There are a lot of areas where one cannot do leading-edge research now, because of the regulations and hurdles that have been put in place. The scientists in those areas have brains that are easily exportable. They can go offshore and get better salaries and greater continuity in their incomes and careers, rather than stay here and see artificial barriers put in place that disallow them from doing good scientific work. I do not think there are any mad scientists in New Zealand. There is a group of scientists who want to do some studies in an area that I think will make a huge difference to the lives of a lot of New Zealanders. Hon Maurice Williamson: A lot of them are under stress, though. KATHERINE RICH: My colleague says that some are under stress. That is no surprise. I think some members opposite wish that John Tamihere would be xenotransplanted into another party. But as he says that he will die a Labour man, despite apparently humbling himself before the caucus today—although he does not retract any of his comments—it seems that that will not be the case either, so they should think about putting a moratorium on John Tamihere. That might do them a better service than trying to put up artificial barriers that will just cause loss of life and remove opportunities for New Zealanders to have access to some of these technologies that will make a difference to their lives. Darren Hughes: Is this the same woman who got sacked? KATHERINE RICH: Until Darren Hughes faces a parent on dialysis or a family member who is looking for a transplant of some kind, he should keep his mouth shut because he has no idea what it is like. He can pontificate about the cultural sensitivities of xenotransplantation, but just wait until he sees a dialysis patient in his constituency office, who says: “Your rules are standing between me having a life and not being able to continue.” Then, I think, he might change his tune—once he understands the human face of these decisions. The Government is trying to hold back the tide of science. It is quite Luddite to pretend that science will stop its work in this area. It is only New Zealand that will stop work in this area, while the rest of the world will continue to provide opportunities for science. Science will march on and provide some life-giving solutions to a lot of people who are waiting for these opportunities—who are waiting for the second chance at life that might come from a pig kidney, a pig liver, or some other transplanted organ. So it is all very well for members opposite to be theoretical about this moratorium and pretend that it will not have an impact. We know that it will. Many, many New Zealanders will be worse off because the Labour Government thinks it can hold back the scientific tide and deny a lot of New Zealanders many lifesaving solutions that will make a difference to their lives and allow them to continue—if, of course, we have any scientists to continue this work once this moratorium is over. As we know, not many scientists who go to the United States or to the UK make the transition back into New Zealand. A few have, but not many come back once they get used to research grants, good salaries, better conditions, continuity in their work, and better opportunities. We are worse off because we lose those brains—those people who could do a huge amount of work within our Crown research institutes here in New Zealand.",summarize the following text: ,"Xenotransplantation is the implantation of living biological material from animals into humans The Bill extends controls on xenotransplantation This  is a serious indictment on this Government’s attitude towards science this bill is the instrument the Government put on science to stop xenotransplantation it is forcing top New Zealand scientists to do their work overseas It is hugely important to have a complement of scientists who are capable in the new genetics.

"Legalize and tax it has become a mantra of the pro- marijuana movement. It has proven to be a seductive message and a clever long-term strategy for making legalization more palatable to people who might not otherwise be inclined to tolerate drugs and drug use. The tempting idea that taxing marijuana can raise significant new revenues strikes a responsive chord. One major reason why Alcohol Prohibition was repealed was that repealers promised that alcohol taxes would make a federal income tax unnecessary as Daniel Okrent reported in his brilliant book, Last Call. But is that a realistic expectation? Will sufficient revenue be raised to offset the costs of the harms inflicted on individuals and society from wider marijuana use? When President Barack Obama was questioned in 2011, about whether he believed that taxing legal marijuana would help relieve the nations financial situation, he responded. No, I don’t think that is a good strategy to grow our economy.”2 His response was firmly grounded In the findings of many academic studies over the previous decade. The social costs of marijuana production and use will far exceed what state and local governments collect as actual tax revenue. We’ve been down this road with alcohol we’ve seen this pattern before. Society gains about $15 to $20 billion a year from the taxes imposed on alcohol, while It loses over $200 billion a year in health- care, criminal justice, and other costs directly related to alcohol use and abuse. That’s a ratio of 10 to 1 (or higher) of costs to revenue. Tobacco is hardly better. The $25 billion collected In tobacco taxes doesn’t even come close to offsetting the more than $200 billion in lost social costs from tobacco use. These sorts of trade-offs don’t benefit taxpayers or institutions of government, and they certainly don’t support the health needs of people unable to control their compulsion to abuse ""sin taxes"" substances as these become more widely available and socially accepted. Taxing legal marijuana won’t generate anywhere near the amount of government revenue that the pro-marijuana movement claims. At least five points support this contention. 1. Legalization Would Drive Marijuana Prices Down. If marijuana is legalized using models adopted by Colorado and Washington we will see the market price of marijuana fall considerably but this drop in price is not factored into estimates of marijuana-generated tax revenue. According to RAND Corporation economist Rosalie Pacula’s testimony before a committee of the California legislature marijuana prices will fall to less than half the figure often employed in revenue estimates by some government budget analysts (some more recent analyses take into account this price drop, but not consistently). In 2010, when a team of five RAND researchers analyzed California's 2010 effort to legalize marijuana, they Concluded that the pre-tax price of the drug could plummet (as much as 80 percent) and therefore marijuana consumption could increase. This was based on a scenario where the federal government did not intervene and Indoor home-production would be allowed. That sharp drop in price complicates any attempts to predict the actual revenues that will result from marijuana taxes. Furthermore, the fall in price will hinder efforts to collect those revenues as a black market springs up to take advantage of the gap between the taxed price of marijuana and the real production cost of marijuana. When legislation that would have legalized marijuana was introduced in the California legislature in 2010, the Proposed tax would have been $50 an Ounce paid at the point of retail, which equals $800 a pound. There would have also been a sales tax. Such a taxing structure would have created a huge incentive for home growers to undercut the state-sanctioned, state-taxed price per pound and avoid paying taxes altogether. If a pound of marijuana can be produced for $75 or less, but in the legal market, the tax alone is at least $800 per pound, one can easily imagine how this discrepancy might cause many producers to stay in the black market to undercut the taxed legal price. This huge gap in costs would also cause consumers to seek out the lower- priced black market marijuana whenever and wherever possible. Additionally, the other regulations that come with marijuana legalization will further strengthen the incentive for black market marijuana cultivation. If governments attempt to regulate the potency of state-sanctioned marijuana (Le.. to legally keep THC potency below a certain level), we can expect an underground market to furnish the higher-potency product that users seek. We can expect the underground market to flourish, which Is not such a stretch when you look at the fact that illegal gambling has filled the gaps where legal gambling has fallen short (e.g., illegal gambling formats such as poker rooms and sports bookmaking flourish because their legal counterparts are unable or unwilling to provide the same services or betting options). 2. Lower Prices Increase Use and Harm. As with any commodity, higher prices are associated with lower demand. That’s a simple rule of economics. And it’s especially the case with marijuana, because so much of the demand for the drug comes from teenagers and college students who are generally more limited in their incomes and access to financial resources. Given marijuana’s costly harms to costs, car crashes, and so forth—an increase in use rates corresponds directly to an increase in the attendant social harms of the drug. In other words, lower prices mean greater harm. It has been estimated that for every 10 percent reduction In the price of marijuana, there is a corresponding 3 percent increase in the number of users and a 5 percent increase in total quantity consumed, though it is impossible to know where those numbers “top our—this depends on many factors. As the price for an ounce of marijuana falls under legalized marijuana in the US, we can possibly expect hundreds of thousands of new users to enter the market place for marijuana, while thousands of current users increase their usage levels. Taxes can, of course, off-set this price collapse, but then high taxes could well invite gray and black markets to thrive. Holland’s experience with cannabis coffee shops provides an instructive example in this respect. After most legal penalties were removed from private possession and marijuana became more widely available through cannabis shops, usage doubled among young adults.’ In the United States, a 50 percent jump in the number of users would be substantial, with a ripple effect of repercussions. Again, taking the example of California as a model for the nation, that state has already seen a gigantic escalation in the number of marijuana users seeking treatment for marijuana abuse or dependence. Between 1992 and 2008, there was a near quintupling of the number of treatment admissions due to marijuana, from seven thousand three hundred to nearly thirty-five thousand, far In excess of the admission numbers for other illicit drugs. One explanation for the admissions upsurge is that THC potency intensified during that time frame, a situation that can only get worse under legalization as growers compete to offer more unique highs from their marijuana products. 3. Tax Revenues Would Be Exceeded by Harm Costs. Legalization would cost taxpayers a lot of money. There will be regulatory costs, legal costs, criminal justice and healthcare costs, a loss of productivity resulting from higher use, and so forth. These costs are rarely balanced adequately against the claim that marijuana will generate tax revenue. RAND economist Rosalie Pacula testified before a committee of the California State Assembly in 2009: “As an economist who has been conducting drug policy analyses for almost 15 years, it Is very Important to consider a full cost-benefit analysis before undertaking large reforms like marijuana legalization.’ She pointed out numerous instances where the largely unrecognized costs of legalization would weigh heavily on society.’ For example, researchers studied hospital admissions for people with marijuana dependence as a primary diagnosis and determined that their “median lengths of stay are twice to three times longer than those experienced by patients admitted for alcohol, cocaine or heroin and therefore result in higher average charges.”° For the uninsured, that means taxpayers are often called upon to pay for these costs through Medicaid and other health support programs. Under any marijuana legalization scheme there will still be criminal justice costs because there are expenses associated with regulating the industry. As I stated under the third myth, we already have almost 2.5 million arrests a year because of drunk driving violations, liquor law violations, and public intoxication. By contrast, marijuana-related arrests today stand at around eight hundred thousand. 4. Regulation and Tax Collection Costs Would Be High. Enforcing the regulatory and taxing provisions of a legalization law will require an expenditure of public resources, that much is certain. How much in the way of tax dollars will be needed remains a guesstimate depending on a wide variety of factors. As with alcohol and the alcohol beverage boards created by most states as regulatory authorities, there would be a need for the creation of marijuana regulation enforcement bureaucracies at the state level. There would be changes in state and local government expenditures on law enforcement and drug treatment. Quality and safety control bureaucracies composed of health inspectors would have to be expanded, especially for inspecting facilities that produce baked goods containing marijuana. And agencies would have to be set up to test legally grown and distributed marijuana for potency and contamination. In short, there will be new administrative, regulatory and law- enforcement costs of managing legalization, and these will impact budgets at all levels of government. Medical marijuana regimes are the closest regulatory models we have to a regime of full legalization. But the capacities of states to properly regulate medical marijuana have been greatly tested. In Colorado, a scathing report released in 2013 showed that the states bureaucracy could not handle its medical marijuana program. An audit found the medical marijuana division “rife with wasteful spending, shoddy enforcement and unfulfilled expectations. Systems that were supposed to track marijuana plants from seed to sale were incomplete. Measures that were supposed to prevent criminals from getting involved in the industry had failed. 5. Tax Evasion Would Be Widespread. Just because an excise tax is levied does not mean that it will be collected,0 pointed out the team of analysts who did the 2010 RAND study of how marijuana legalization would affect the California bud get. To help determine the extent to which a tax on marijuana might be evaded, they examined relatively recent studies of experiences with tobacco taxes. A 2000 study in (he British Medical Journal, for instance, looked at what happened when several Canadian provinces imposed $3 per pack cigarette tax In the 1990s. A black market for untaxed cigarettes and an enormous smuggling problem rapidly developed. The demand for lower-cost untaxed cigarettes soon resulted in 30 percent of all cigarette sales taking place on the black market. As a Consequence, these provinces repealed the tax.’ California Board of Equalization officials have recently estimated that cigarette excise tax revenue evasion was $182 million in fiscal year 2005—6. Around 15 percent of all cigarettes sold In that state have somehow avoided the excise taxes in place on each pack to raise revenues for the state budget,’ This is lower than evasion rates in other countries, according to the chief economist for the California Board of Equalization. For example, about 22 percent of the ILK, domestic cigarette market now consists of smuggled cigarettes. In Canada, smuggled cigarettes represented about 33 per cent of all domestic cigarette consumption at their peak.’ State by state data collected in 2008, indicates that states with the highest excise taxes on each pack or carton of cigarettes also experience the highest rates of tax evasion,’5 This should give us a strong clue about what will happen if and when taxes are imposed on legal marijuana. The case for evasion is stronger for marijuana than for cigarettes, especially because most proposals for taxing marijuana call for considerably greater amounts than the typical $5 an ounce tax on cigarettes. In 2010, the California Board of Equalization estimated that marijuana, taxed at $50 per ounce, could bring in $1.4 billion of revenue for the state, Advocates have touted this as badly needed revenue. But as the RAND researchers concluded, ‘Tax revenues could be dramatically lower or higher than the $1.4 billion estimate; for example, there Is uncertainty about potential tax revenues that California might derive from taxing marijuana used by residents of other states (e.g., from ‘drug tourism’).” The financial incentive to avoid paying marijuana taxes would be so great, especially at proposed levels ($50/ounce in California In 2009 or 25 percent each for processors, retailers, and consumers in Washington in 2012), that the black market In marijuana would equal or even dwarf the underground economy that already exists. THE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF LEGALIZATION. If not taxpayers or state and local governments, then who would profit most from the legalization of marijuana? The website Dallylinance.com did an analysis to identify’ this list of predictable winners in the marijuana profit game: Mainstream tobacco companies: that is firms “that already have a foothold in the smoking marker; Manufacturers of rolling papers, pipes, and bongs, several of which are also publicly held tobacco companies such as Nation al Tobacco, owner of Zig-Zag rolling papers; Junk food providers and major food industry corporations 111e Kraft Foods (owned. Incidentally, by Philip Morris from 1988 to 2007) are already well positioned to cash in on the munchies attacks that typically occur following marijuana consumption’ It could be argued that some additional tax revenue would result from the increased sale of products (e.g.. junk food or rolling papers) that are complements to marijuana, though there is no go way to predict how much. We have no reason to believe, however that such indirect revenues would even come close to matching the total costs of marijuana legalization. No matter how we look at it, legalizing marijuana will not solve government budgetary woes. If anything, it would make our fiscal situation worse: any revenue gained from taxing this drug would be quickly and substantially offset by the heavy costs associated with its increased prevalence. It’s a price we can’t afford to bear.
Status quo marijuana legalization proceeding slowly on state by state basis stopping the bubble from bursting – federal legalization bursts the Bubble on the industry
Copeland 13 (“Is Marijuana Legalization the Next Bubble Industry?”, Policy.Mic, Tripp, http://mic.com/articles/22612/is-marijuana-legalization-the-next-bubble-industry, analyst for a Washington DC-based defense company, and I hold a J.D. from University of Richmond School of Law and a B.A. in history from Hampden-Sydney College)
Trying to determine the next economic bubble is an unfortunate reality in America’s current economic environment. It has become a consideration when deciding whether or not to enter an industry either in a career or as an investment opportunity. However, this wasn’t always the reality. Although economic bubbles have always existed, in the last 25 years or so — from the savings and loan crisis to the dotcom bust to the real estate bubble — they have become more commonplace. Now that this determination is part of any due diligence, it is vital to understand the characteristics of a bubble in order to help identify the next one. I have some of my own thoughts about the creation of bubbles, including limited barriers to market penetration, perverse federal policy and the speedy entry of financial resources. But for this analysis let’s turn to an expert, Hyman Minsky, and his Theory of Financial Instability. According to Minsky, there are five elements to any bubble scenario. First, in the displacement stage, a new entity piques investor interest. Second, the boom stage ensues as prices and participants begin to rise. The third characteristic is euphoria where investors create justifications for increasingly higher market prices. Forth, the participants see a profit taking opportunity and money begins to leave the market. And last, the panic sets in when prices fall dramatically and investors sell out to protect against financial ruin. I believe the emerging pot industry is protected against this phenomenon — for now. The most important factor protecting the marijuana industry from economic bubble status is a conflict of laws. Conflict between federal prohibition and state legalization measures will allow the industry to grow at a reasonable pace, as large scale financial and insurance institutions will hesitate to support investors in a federally prohibited industry. Although the marijuana industry is not lacking financial resources due to private and venture capital money, creating a economic bust similar to the dotcom or housing market will require a much larger influx of financial resources and participants. Without legalization on a federal level, that influx is unlikely. Legal conflicts impose a scaling problem on the industry, limiting its growth. However, in the long run, those limitations may be exactly what create a lasting dynamic.  Additionally, the incremental implementation via a state-by-state federalism approach will allow the industry to learn from mistakes and determine best practices. Moreover, state governments will be able to study different implementation methods, as they already differ on how to regulate a nascent marijuana industry. Federalism also has the benefit of limiting federal policy intervention. Although the federal government has not yet determined how to proceed, it seems likely they will leave this issue to the states. And by limiting the invasion of federal policy through true federalism, there is less of a chance for broad, top-down policies to facilitate a bubble environment. Finally, the American marijuana industry is not new; it is just legal now. For decades an illegal market has existed, resulting in some of the highest rates of pot smoking in the world. While new rules and regulations will affect the existing market, many of the early participants will have experience and knowledge to apply to the new, legal pot start-ups. Furthermore, we already have industry models illustrating how to produce, market and sell vice products. Both the alcohol and cigarette industry are longstanding and thriving examples to those entrepreneurs exploring the marijuana economic landscape. In fact, the cigarette industry already has thoughts of applying their model to this newly legal substance — although they wont admit it. Longstanding demand, cultural knowledge and existing business models will help the marijuana industry develop sustainably over time. Even though I don’t see the emerging recreational marijuana industry as the next great American bubble, that doesn’t mean the industry will not experience its share of failures. That is part of American entrepreneurialism. Limited resources, other industry examples and Federalism can only safeguard an emerging industry so much; investors and other participants will inevitably assume too much risk and make costly mistakes. However, I do see an increasingly strong industry as more states legalize marijuana. But once this becomes a federal issue and large-scale investors get involved all bets are off.",summarize the following text: ,"Legalize and tax it has become a mantra of the pro- marijuana movement The tempting idea that taxing marijuana can raise significant new revenues strikes a responsive chord.

And agencies would have to be set up to test legally grown and distributed marijuana for potency and contamination there will be new administrative, regulatory and law- enforcement costs of managing legalization, and these will impact budgets at all levels of government. the capacities of states to properly regulate medical marijuana have been greatly tested. In Colorado, a scathing report released in 2013 showed that the states bureaucracy could not handle its medical marijuana program the medical marijuana division “rife with wasteful spending, shoddy enforcement and unfulfilled expectations. Systems that were supposed to track marijuana plants from seed to sale were incomplete. Measures that were supposed to prevent criminals from getting involved in the industry had failed. 5. Tax Evasion Would Be Widespread. Just because an excise tax is levied does not mean that it will be collected when several Canadian provinces imposed $3 per pack cigarette tax In the 1990s. A black market for untaxed cigarettes and an enormous smuggling problem rapidly developed The demand for lower-cost untaxed cigarettes soon resulted in 30 percent of all cigarette sales taking place on the black market. these provinces repealed the tax cigarette excise tax revenue evasion was $182 million in fiscal year 2005 Around 15 percent of all cigarettes sold In that state have somehow avoided the excise taxes in place on each pack to raise revenues for the state budget that states with the highest excise taxes on each pack or carton of cigarettes also experience the highest rates of tax evasion,’5 This should give us a strong clue about what will happen if and when taxes are imposed on legal marijuana. The case for evasion is stronger for marijuana than for cigarettes because proposals for taxing marijuana call for considerably greater amounts than the typical $5 an ounce tax on cigarettes. Tax revenues could be dramatically lower or higher than the $1.4 billion estimate; for example, there Is uncertainty about potential tax revenues that California might derive from taxing marijuana used by residents of other states The financial incentive to avoid paying marijuana taxes would be so great at proposed levels ($50/ounce in California In 2009 or 25 percent each for processors, retailers, and consumers in Washington in 2012), that the black market In marijuana would equal or even dwarf the underground economy that already exists. who would profit most from the legalization of marijuana? Mainstream tobacco companies Manufacturers of rolling papers, pipes, and bongs, several of which are also publicly held tobacco companies such as Nation al Tobacco, owner of Zig-Zag rolling papers; Junk food providers and major food industry corporations 111e Kraft Foods are already well positioned to cash in on the munchies attacks that typically occur following marijuana consumption’ It could be argued that some additional tax revenue would result from the increased sale of products that are complements to marijuana, though there is no go way to predict how much. We have no reason to believe, however that such indirect revenues would even come close to matching the total costs of marijuana legalization. No matter how we look at it, legalizing marijuana will not solve government budgetary woes. If anything, it would make our fiscal situation worse: any revenue gained from taxing this drug would be quickly and substantially offset by the heavy costs associated with its increased prevalence. It’s a price we can’t afford to bear.

The most important factor protecting marijuana from economic bubble status is a conflict of laws between federal prohibition and state legalization measures allow the industry to grow at a reasonable pace as large scale financial and insurance institutions will hesitate to support investors in a federally prohibited industry creating a economic bust will require a much larger influx of financial resources and participants Without legalization on a federal level that influx is unlikely Legal conflicts impose a scaling problem on the industry limiting its growth those limitations may be exactly what create a lasting dynamic the incremental implementation via a state-by-state federalism approach will allow the industry to learn from mistakes and determine best practices  federal government  likely will leave this issue to the states by limiting the invasion of federal policy through true federalism there is less of a chance for broad, top-down policies to facilitate a bubble environment Longstanding demand cultural knowledge and existing business models will help the marijuana industry develop sustainably over time I don’t see the emerging recreational marijuana industry as the next great American bubble I do see an increasingly strong industry as more states legalize marijuana. But once this becomes a federal issue and large-scale investors get involved all bets are off."
"Karen Hudson's essay on the global organ trade began life as her final research project for my Clark Honors College seminar on disability studies at the University of Oregon. This 25-student interdisciplinary colloquium included a diversity of majors, from hard sciences to the humanities. Many students had firsthand or familial knowledge of a broad spectrum of disabilities, and the course satisfied a University of Oregon multicultural requirement. There are important controversies involved in teaching disability as a cultural identity to fulfill multicultural requirements, as such courses can permit students to avoid education on race and thus reinscribe white privilege. I addressed this problem by assigning readings and films that show the intersections of disability with race, class, and gender identity. These Honors College juniors and seniors entered the course already skilled at research, and I encouraged students to design research projects that would fill gaps in existing disability studies scholarship. Karen Hudson's essay provides an excellent example of research that broadens the scope of disability studies through attention to the literature on globalization. Her approach reveals a structural inequality between rich and poor people with disabilities. She differentiates between ""the disability community entering the global organ trade and those who are products of it."" Hudson humanizes the vast scale of the underground market through her focus on the organ donors and their acquired disabilities. Describing the donors' postoperative lack of medical and social support, Hudson highlights what could be seen as an important area for international disability advocacy. In ""Universal Design: The Work of Disability in an Age of Globalization,"" Michael Davidson links disability to the negative impacts of globalization. He considers the organ trade, in which bodies become commodities in an international market reflecting wealth and poverty, and comments on the silence about disability in literature on globalization (121). So how are people with disabilities involved in — or products of — the organ trade, and what aspects of globalization are creating and exploiting this international community of disabled people? The implications of the silence in regard to disability and the organ trade are significant, because aspects of globalization — particularly the spreading of a competitive market-based economy and the resulting privatization of healthcare — are perpetuating a hierarchy based on wealth and privilege that is exploiting poverty-stricken individuals for their organs. These exploited individuals are now(VIEWED AS) disabled not only by the absence of an organ, but also productively within the community. This lowered productivity stems not from the state of disability itself, but rather from a lack of proper follow-up medical care that may result in further health complications. In turn, these health complications more often than not perpetuate the indebted state from which donors were hoping to free themselves in the first place. Despite the condemnation of selling organs, which dates back to a 1985 World Medical Association statement and principles forbidding commercial transactions relating to ""the human body and its parts"" set forth by the World Health Organization in 1991, money still exchanges hands for harvested organs on the black market (Wilkinson 104; Garwood 5). It is estimated that 10% of the 63,000 annual kidney transplants involve payment to a non-related donor of a different nationality, and this statistic not only highlights the practice of paying for organs, which is illegal in many countries, but introduces the international aspect of the organ trade (Garwood 5). Considering that a kidney can be bought from a donor for $1,000-3,000, and can be sold for up to $40,000, it is apparent that a huge market-driven divide exists between those involved in a transaction on which livelihoods are based (Cohen 663; Scheper-Hughes 5; Garwood 5). This discrepancy between the donor's compensation and the ultimate market value of a kidney is a product of the competitive, profit-focused market economy encouraged by globalization. Nancy Scheper-Hughes is a member of Organs Watch, a human rights group operating out of the University of California, Berkeley. The purpose of this organization is to investigate rumors, complaints, and allegations involving the trafficking of organs, human rights violations regarding the acquisition of organs, and related issues. In her report published on the Organs Watch website, Scheper-Hughes notes how organ transplantation follows ""modern routes of capital,"" ""from third world to first world, from poor to rich bodies, from black to brown to white bodies"" (5). As globalization promotes a market economy, the competitive nature of this market is reflected in many facets of society, including a nation's healthcare system. The currency of the exchange, be it in dollars or organs, often flows as Scheper-Hughes describes. As an example, Davidson refers to when Bayer sold large quantities of a blood-clotting factor to Asia and Latin America, because the product was not fit for sale in the United States or Europe. The result of this transaction was an HIV infection rate of 90% among those targeted by the company, and a profit of four million dollars for Bayer (Davidson 121). This is an example of money flowing out of developing nations to wealthier ones in a global economy and at a cost to the developing nation. When this occurs in the context of the organ trade, the results are similar — the exploitation of those without money and resources by those with money and resources. Lawrence Cohen, in a discussion about ""kidney zones"" in India, illustrates how social hierarchy and corporate competition interact to produce areas where the organ trade flourishes. He hypothesizes that ""kidney zones"" (areas where kidneys are sold in large numbers) ""emerge through interactions between surgical entrepreneurs, persons facing extraordinary debt, and medical brokers"" (676). Globalization has brought the once rare procedure of organ transplantation, before carried out only in developed nations, to countries around the world (Scheper-Hughes 4). This set the stage for the competition between public and private healthcare entities, and in combination with surgeons willing to take risks for money and a pool of indebted citizens willing to do whatever it takes to keep their family afloat, the organ trade thrives. In Brazil, the competitive economic pressures of a market-based economy have contributed to a healthcare system that fuels the supply and demand of organ trading. As discussed by Scheper-Hughes, there exists outside the free national healthcare system a private medical sector, resulting in a competition for organs between free health clinics and private ones. She also explains that the financial incentives are much higher in the private sector, and so it is the private clinics that are more aggressive about obtaining organs so that they can charge more — and thus profit more — from transplant surgeries (31). Of course, it is possible that the organs obtained are legitimately donated, but evidence exists of police investigations into the so-called ""body mafia"" that suggests otherwise. This group of criminals has links with hospital and ambulance staff, as well as within the police force in an underground ring designed to trade human organs (Scheper-Hughes 31). In this example, the flow of money remains in the country, but those who prosper are a select few, and those on waiting lists in public hospitals may be skipped over as newly available organs go to wealthy private clients (Scheper-Hughes 32). In 2007, China introduced a new set of regulations in an attempt to crack down on the sale of organs (Watts 1917). China is a unique example of the hierarchical flow of organs and money, as it is the only country that uses the organs of executed prisoners for organ transplantation (Scheper-Hughes 21). There has been much advocacy against this practice by international human rights activists, but China has held out. Why continue the internationally rejected practice of harvesting organs from executed prisoners? Perhaps because China has become a mecca for wealthy foreigners in need of transplants and who are capable of paying up to $30,000 for an organ (Watts 1917; Scheper-Hughes 22). With the Chinese healthcare system becoming increasingly market-driven, hospitals are under significant pressure to generate income, and therefore ask fewer ethical questions about the sources of the organs (Watts 1917). To better understand Scheper-Hughes' flowchart model of organs and capital, one must differentiate between the disabled parties involved in the organ trade. Effects of globalization affect two separate categories of people, both of which may identify as having disabilities. The first category consists of those in need of an organ, which can be further divided into wealthy private clientele and the locals who are often skipped over to serve these wealthier individuals. The second category is composed of those who sell their organs. This group of ""donors"" is most drastically exploited by economic and healthcare systems. These people are impaired due to the extraction of an organ and disabled because they are often left in debt and may be unable to be a productive member of society due to a lack of proper medical care, both preceding and following the removal of an organ. The wealthy, often foreign, recipients of organs cannot be left out of the disability discussion as it relates to the organ trade. They provide a striking contrast to the situation of ""disabled"" when compared to the donors, and they are a causal link in the situation of the neglected local recipients. The wealthy foreigner is literally buying his or her way to the front of the waiting list, taking an organ that should have gone to a local with the same chronic condition. This is a big problem in China, where 1.5 million Chinese wait for various transplants (Watts 1917). In South Africa, a nurse expresses her hostility towards those foreigners arriving in local hospitals in search of organs: ""[A]s far as I am concerned South African organs belong to South African citizens. And…before I see a white person from Namibia getting their hands on a heart or kidney that belongs to a little Black South African child, I myself will see to it that the bloody organ gets tossed into a bucket"" (Scheper-Hughes 11). Her statement encapsulates the flow of organs from the traditionally marginalized to the privileged and highlights a social aspect of disability. Though both the wealthy foreigner and the local might identify as having a disability due to the chronic condition for which organ transplantation is necessary to treat, there are social aspects that affect available options for both parties. The wealthy foreigner is in a position to travel long distances and pay large sums of money for an organ, while a local relying on public health care lies in a hospital bed on a waiting list. Able to pay at least double what the local insurance allows for locals, the wealthy foreigners are a target market for competitive companies in the healthcare industry (Scheper-Hughes 11). This inequality is not addressed by globalization; rather, it is exacerbated by the expansion of the international competitive economy as reflected in healthcare systems. Disability exists, to an arguable degree, when society instills it in an individual. The already trying conditions of the local on the waiting list are worsened by social support for the current systems of globalization. Even if a local on a waiting list is fortunate enough to receive an organ, there are other factors that may make that individual's situation worse than that of the line-cutting foreigner. While waiting for a transplant, dialysis might not be available due to a general lack of infrastructure in the area or because of financial concerns (Hoyer 1367). The recipients may also not be fully informed that they are not ""exchanging a death sentence for a new life, but that they are exchanging one mortal, chronic disease for another"" (Scheper-Hughes 9). This refers to the complications following transplantation and also to the medically-related maintenance required to maximize the benefit of the new organ. Donors often have little or no access to hospital care following the extraction of an organ, which is necessary to prevent complications after surgery (Cohen 668). A woman in Pakistan donated a kidney to support her family after her husband was unable to work after an accident, but her health became worse after the donation because she received no post-operative care (Garwood 5). Documentation on poor organ recipients in Brazil showed that they were unable to afford the costly immunosuppressant therapy to prevent organ rejection, and had to pool and taper their doses prematurely, as one month of the immunosuppressant drug costs more than most of those families earn in a month (Cohen 678). These impoverished recipients are forced to choose between maintaining their health and plummeting (possibly further) into debt. Though the donation of an organ in itself might not constitute a disability, being unable to work and live a healthy life because of a lack of available medical care following organ extraction does. The ""donors"" of the organs going to those wait-listed locals and wealthy travelers are the crux of disability and the black market organ trade. I will refer to these individuals as organ ""donors,"" but note that such a term denotes a voluntariness that is brought into question with the following arguments, as well as a false implication of no compensation for the ""donors."" However, I will use ""donor"" as a critical commentary on the continual denial of the role globalization is playing to worsen the situations of those in a position to ""donate"" their organs; primarily, how globalization is failing to address the issue of debt on the part of the donor, and the resulting acceptance of the use of body parts as currency to pay off these debts. Cohen, in his time spent in India studying the organ trade, summarizes the plight of kidney donors. The theme running through each story he heard was that of debt and poverty (666). Scheper-Hughes makes the statement, ""A market price — even a fair one — on body parts exploits the desperation of the poor"" (19). This is a desperation coming out of debt-ridden and poverty-stricken situations, even culminating in newspaper ads offering to sell body parts. A major paper in Brazil ran an ad ""offering to sell any organ of my body that is not vital to my survival and which could help save another person's life in exchange for an amount of money that will allow me to feed my family"" (Scheper-Hughes 30). A woman in Bangladesh placed an ad in the Sunday paper to sell one of her eyes in order to pay rent and feed her daughter (Zora 1). This problem of debt drives organ donations, but does not disappear once a body part has been sold (Cohen 676). All of the donors with whom Cohen spoke were back in debt despite having sold a kidney, possibly related to issues linked to their social status (676). Problems relating to social status are often related to oppression within a given system, reflecting less on the struggling individual and more on the system in which he or she lives. The organ trade has also changed the way bodies are seen by debt-collectors. The image of the mafia breaking the legs of someone who borrowed money is a familiar one, but in places like India, organs are seen as another form of collateral for debt-collectors (Cohen 676). This expectation that body parts can and should be traded for currency is also reflected in the thought processes of those in debt, as evidenced by the newspaper ads and the information compiled by Cohen about poverty as a common theme of donors. In Pakistan, often those who donate kidneys have no other way to make money because they live in a bonded labor system, tied to property owned by those financially better off (Garwood 6). Without the means of production, these Pakistanis sell their organs in an attempt to liberate themselves from this oppressive debt bondage. There have been a number of suggestions to improve conditions for organ donors in attempts to prevent individuals from becoming a disabled product of the organ trade. Cohen notes that no data exist on the long-term effects of kidney extractions, despite doctors insisting that risk is minimal (674). If studies could be done to examine the longitudinal effects of donating a kidney or other organ, donors could be more informed about their decisions. These studies would be particularly beneficial if conducted in situations outside the typical medical model of affluent white donors altruistically giving up kidneys to relatives in developed nations, as this typical situation is not the ""typical"" experience of those exploited by the organ trade. Knowing the risks, both physically and in regard to ending up back in debt, might not realistically make a difference for someone in as desperate of a situation as Cohen and Scheper-Hughes describe, but the effort going into such a project would raise awareness of pertinent issues. This process would work towards combating the silence Davidson describes between globalization and disability. There has also been significant effort put into developing measures that can be used to aid in the decision-making of an organ recipient that includes five supposedly quantifiable measures representing ""burden of disease,"" and this measure is designed to help a possible organ recipient decide if he or she wants to go through with the transplant and to further educate the recipient about the nature of his or her situation and possible outcomes (Krakauer 1555). The development of this measure illustrates the amount of focus placed on the organ recipient instead of the donor, despite the fact that such research could be used as a framework for donor decision-making as well. The constant refusal to acknowledge the needs of the organ donors — from simply investing time in gathering and conveying accurate and comprehensive information to addressing underlying societal problems of class hierarchies — is a significant problem. It is today's system of globalization that disregards the needs of impoverished individual donors both before and after organ transplantations, in turn creating an international community of (PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES)disabled people. The imposition of economic structures that fuel competition between private corporations and public entities (such as hospitals) only compounds already present inequalities and hierarchies in developing nations. Experts advocate developing clear regulations for healthcare systems on a global scale and shifting the focus to preventative medicine to avoid problems that lead to organ failure, but if these changes are made under the same systems that are praising globalization as we know it, then they might not really be changes at all (Hoyer 1367; Garwood 5). The disabled community entering into the organ trade, and those who are products of it, would greatly benefit from structural changes in society that work to break down class hierarchies, providing support for those in poverty and making healthcare available that is of the same quality as that received by the wealthy. Such changes could very well be brought about through the process of globalization, but not as globalization is progressing today. The black market organ trade itself could be curbed with proper advancements addressing the conditions of the donors, because, as an Indian report on the ethical considerations of the organ trade noted: ""In the final analysis, poverty and deprivation sustain the trade in human organs"" (Hoyer 1367).",summarize the following text: ,"how are people with disabilities involved in — or products of — the organ trade, and what aspects of globalization are creating and exploiting this international community of disabled people?

"The picaresque proves uncannily effective at dramatizing another critical dimension to the environmentalism of the urban poor—their relationship to time. Like the picaro, the environmentally embattled slum dwellers are hell-bent on immediate survival, improvising from day to day, from hour to hour. Their temporal element is ""now o'clock"" (Animal's 185), their lives subject to the ﬁckle tyranny of the eternal today. Yet collectively, the city's environmentally afﬂicted are bound in complex ways to past and future through the metamorphoses wrought by toxicity, the pursuit of social justice, and their collective relationship to apocalyptic time. The environmental picaresque of Animal's People pivots on two apocalypses: the horrors of ""that night"" (1) when the interminable narrative of poisoning began and the certainty that, over the long haul, as the activist Zafar insists, the poor possess ""the power of zero"" (214). 18 Global geopolitics may, in the short term, be skewed against them, but time is on their side: the Kampani has everything to fear from those with nothing to lose. Animal insists as much in the novel's closing lines: ""All things pass, but the poor remain. We are the people of the Apokalis. Tomorrow there will be more of us"" (366). Animal's ﬁnal words echo uncannily the end of Mike Davis's non-ﬁctional Planet of the Slums, the most arresting socio-political account of the contemporary neoliberal shantytown world from which, implicitly, the contemporary picaro emerges. ""If the empire can deploy Orwellian technologies of repression,"" Davis warns, ""its outcasts have the gods of chaos on their side"" (206). Reﬂecting on Hurricane Katrina, Michael Eric Dyson writes memorably of ""the color of disaster"" as integral to the ""neoliberal neglect"" that has plagued American politics for over twenty years (23). In keeping with Dyson's stance, we can refuse the unsustainable divide between human disasters (like Bhopal and Chernobyl) and natural ones (like Katrina), dissociating ourselves, for example, from ex-President George W. Bush's insistence that ""the storm didn't discriminate and neither will the recovery effort"" (qtd. In Weinberg 3). 19 Discrimination predates disaster: in failures to maintain protective structures, failures at pre-emergency hazard mitigation, failures to maintain infrastructure, failures to organize evacuation plans for those who lack private transport, all of which make the poor and racial minorities disproportionately vulnerable to catastrophe. As investigative Indian reporters writing for publications like the Hindustan Times and Statesmen were quick to reveal, the Union Carbide disaster was preceded by a long history of structural neglect and a reckless ﬂouting of elementary safety measures. 20 If we project Dyson's national ""color of disaster"" onto a transnational screen, his phrase can be seen—like Animal's ﬁnal words—to point backward to global crimes of environmental racism (that treat certain communities as more expendable than others) and forward as a global portent. The poor of the world are the uncontainable color of a future that cannot be held in check. Yet there is another way to read that future, as a wager—however idealistic—to those in power to embrace the project of more equitable risk distribution, within the nation and beyond. The South African writer, Njabulo Ndebele, puts this case most forcefully: We are all familiar with the global sanctity of the white body. Wherever the white body is violated in the world, severe retributions follow somehow for the perpetrators if they are non-white, regardless of the social status of the white body. The white body is inviolable, and that inviolability is in direct proportion to the vulnerability of the black body. This leads me to think that if South African whiteness is a beneﬁciary of the protectiveness assured by international whiteness, it has an opportunity to write a new chapter in world history. . . . Putting itself at risk, it will have to declare that it is home now, sharing in the vulnerability of other compatriot bodies. South African whiteness will declare that its dignity is inseparable from the dignity of black bodies. (137) Three points are worth underscoring here. First, international whiteness provides a second shield for national whiteness, a protective dynamic that has profound consequences for the way slow violence has unfolded across the global stage in a neoliberal age. Second, and relatedly, the internal distance between the inviolable body and the vulnerable body is widened by being routed through international circuits of power. Third, implicit in Ndebele's racial narrative of violation and retribution is the kind of environmental narrative that Sinha's novel tells, whereby a corporate bastion of white power deploys a battery of distancing strategies (temporal, legalistic, geographical, scientiﬁc, and euphemistic) in the long duree between the initial catastrophe and the aftermath. Through this battery of attritional, dissociative mechanisms the transnational company strives to wear down the environmental justice campaigns that seek compensation, remediation, and restored health and dignity. Under cover of a variety of temporal orders, the company can hope that public memory and demands for restitution will slowly seep out of sight, vanishing into the sands of time. 21 Yet the open-ended politics of catastrophic procrastination do not operate in isolation within the corporate realm. What of the roles of the state and science? If Ndebele exhorts the state to ""jealously and vigorously protect all bodies within its borders and beyond,"" he acknowledges this has seldom been the case (137). 22 In Khaufpur, the Chief Minister and the Minister for Poison Affairs, their palms well greased with bribes, provide local cover for the American Kampani while going through the motions of taking seriously the concerns of exposed locals. The role of science is more complex. In Khaufpur—as in Bhopal— the transnational corporation withheld from the afﬂicted community details about the chemical composition of the insecticides it was producing at the site, profoundly weakening remedial prospects by denying those exposed precise scientiﬁc information. Small wonder that, when an American doctor arrives to open a free clinic in Khaufpur, local activists mounted a boycott, viewing her as an agent of tendentious Kampani science—science whose long-term remit is to generate a circular narrative that will conﬁrm the larger narrative of corporate self-exculpation or, at the very least, oil the machinery of doubt. From this skeptical perspective, the scientiﬁc process, like the legal one, provides further temporal camouﬂage, ostensibly uncovering what happened while deferring and occluding any decisive, actionable narrative. Terror Time and Shadow Kingdoms Khaufpur, translated from the Urdu, means ""city of terror"" (""The Accidental Activist""). The city's poorest denizens inhabit a different terror time from the terror time projected by the Kampani. When the slum-dwellers rise up non-violently to protest the Kampani's inaction, the Kampani, invoking the fallback international rhetoric of terrorism, demands that the protestors be tried in the very Indian courts it has been evading. Back in America, the Kampani engages in corporate anti-terrorist exercises, staging mock abductions and executions of their employees by Khaufpuri ""terrorists"" (Animal's 283). Khaufpuris, by contrast, face a clear and present danger of an environmental kind: an immanent and imminent terror, faceless yet physically intimate, percolating through the penumbral time of the aftermath which is also the suspended time of the illimitable in-between. We all inhabit multiple temporal orders that often co-exist in frictional states, shifting and sliding like tectonic plates. The predominance—and our awareness of—some temporal orders as opposed to others are shaped by where and how we live. We need to ask how directly, how forcefully a given community is impacted by the cycles of sun and moon, by ebbing and ﬂowing tides, by shifts in the seasons, stars, and planets, by the arrivals and departures of migratory life, and by climate change in ways that are cross-hatched with the migratory cycles of transnational capital, electoral cycles (local, national, and foreign), digital time, and the dictates of sweatshop time. Sinha hints at, for example, the unpredictable interface between digital and seasonal time when Animal discovers the ""internest"" on a computer (92). We can gloss his malapropism as fusing different ecologies of time: the ""internest"" is, after all, where images go to breed. Animal's People exposes the uneven timelines, the multiple speeds, of environmental terror: the initial toxic event that kills thousands instantly; the fatal ﬁre that erupts years later when the deserted but still-polluted factory reignites; the contaminants that continue to leach into the communal bloodstream; and the monsoon season that each year washes abandoned chemicals into the aquifers, repoisoning wells and producing new cycles of deferred casualties. Thus the initial air-borne terror morphs into a water-borne terror that acquires its own seasonal rhythms of heightened risk. 23 Ordinarily, rural subsistence communities—""ecosystem people""— are attuned (and vulnerable) to different ecologies of time from those that impact the lives of the urban poor. 24 This is not to suggest that ecosystem people possess some romantic, timeless organic bond to the pulse of nature, but rather to acknowledge that their often precarious conditions of survival depend on different combinations of temporal awareness. However, both rural and urban communities share a vulnerability to the vagaries, the haunting uncertainties, of what Ulrich Beck depicts as a ""shadow kingdom"": Threats from civilization are bringing about a kind of new ""shadow kingdom,"" comparable to the realm of the gods and demons in antiquity, which is hidden behind the visible world and threatens human life on their Earth. People no longer correspond today with spirits residing in things but ﬁnd themselves exposed to ""radiation,"" ingest ""toxic levels,"" and are pursued into their very dreams by the anxiety of a ""nuclear holocaust"" . . . Dangerous, hostile substances lie concealed behind the harmless facades. Everything must be viewed with a double gaze, and can only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the visible must be investigated, relativized with respect to a second reality, only existent in thought and concealed in the world. (72) In Beck's depiction this imperceptible shadow kingdom is spatially recessed behind ""harmless facades."" But his spatial trope warrants a temporal gloss as well: beyond the optical façade of immediate peril what demons lurk in the penumbral realms of the long duree? What forces distract or discourage us from maintaining the double gaze across time? And what forces—imaginative, scientiﬁc, and activist—can help us extend the temporal horizons of our gaze not just retrospectively but prospectively as well? How, in other words, do we subject that shadow kingdom to a temporal optic that might allow us to see—and foresee—the lineaments of slow terror behind the façade of sudden spectacle? We need to question here Beck's assumption that ""people no longer correspond today with spirits residing in things,"" that, in other words, the divine and demonic shadow kingdom ""of antiquity"" has been superseded by the modern shadow kingdom of toxic and radiological hazards. This sequential narrative of threat does not adequately convey the persistent vitality of the numinous within modernity. For the majority of our planet's people (and this is something Sinha brings to life) the two kingdoms of toxic threat and spiritual threat interpenetrate and blend, creating a hybrid world of technonuminous fears. Sinha and Carson: Leakages and Corporate Evaporations Animal's People gives focus to the environmental politics of permeation and duration. Leakages suffuse the novel: gas leakages and category leakages, porous borders and permeable membranes, the living who are semi-dead and the dead who are living specters. 25 What, the novel asks across a variety of fronts, are the boundaries of identity? Where do identities part or merge? How much change must an entity (an individual, a community, a corporation) undergo before it can assume the name of categorical difference, drawing a line across time? On the subject of bounded and porous identities, it is worth noting one aspect of the Union Carbide story that Sinha, for whatever reasons, declined to enfold into his novel. In 2001, Union Carbide disappeared through that act of corporate necromancy known as the merger. Dow Chemical bought out Union Carbide; the name indelibly associated with disaster evaporated, further confounding the quest in Bhopal for environmental justice, compensation, remediation, and redress. Dow Chemical deployed this nominal vanishing act, this corporate shape shifting, as a rationale for disclaiming responsibility for a disaster committed by a now-extinct corporation. 26 If, with Chernobyl, the environmental fallout outlasted the empire responsible, with Union Carbide, the fallout outlasted the transnational company responsible. Thus Soviet imperial fracture and American corporate merger both effectively circumvented or ofﬂoaded historical culpability for the continued slow violence of delayed effects. The evaporation of Union Carbide exempliﬁes the gap between the relative immobility of environmentally afﬂicted populations and the mobility (in time and space) afforded transnational corporations. What the extinct company leaves behind is ongoing proof of the excellent durability of its products; as Animal notes sardonically, the Kampani clearly concocted ""wonderful poisons . . . so good it's impossible to get rid of them, after all these years they're still doing their work"" (Animal's 306). The factory may have been abandoned, but the invisible poisons remain dynamic, industrious, and alive—full time workers round the clock. The far less resilient biota, however, express themselves primarily through the sensuality of absence: ""Listen, how quiet,"" Animal observes as he wanders the factory grounds. ""No bird song. No hoppers in the grass. No bee hum. Insects can't survive here"" (185). Sinha's rhetorical strategy here—his summoning of ecological carnage through negative presence—echoes ""La Belle Dame sans Merci"" which Rachel Carson chose as the epigraph to Silent Spring: ""The sedge is wither'd from the lake, / And no birds sing."" Sinha's approach calls to mind, too, Carson's use of negative presence in the controversial ""Fable for Tomorrow"" that launches Silent Spring, where she evokes the plight of a devastated community. In a once harmonious American heartland town (dubbed ""Green Meadows"" in an early draft) ""There was a strange stillness. The birds, for example—where had they gone? . . . The hens brooded, but no chicks hatched. . . . The apple trees were coming into bloom but no bees droned among the blossoms, so there was no pollination and there would be no fruit"" (Carson 2–3). Both writers give the absence wrought by toxicity a sensory density; in so doing they strike a complex temporal note, inducing in us, through blended elegy and apocalypse, lamentation and premonition, a double gaze, backward in time to loss and forward to as-yet-unrealized-threats. Through this double gaze they restage environmental time, asserting its broad parameters against the myopic, fevered immediacy that governs the society of the catastrophe-as-spectacle. The blighted community Carson depicts in ""A Fable for Tomorrow"" did not exist in its entirety, although all the component disasters Carson fed into her composite, ﬁctionalized portrait had occurred at some point somewhere in America. By clustering these scattered micro-disasters into a single imaginary community, she sought to counter the dissociative thinking encouraged by the temporal and spatial dispersion of environmental violence, acts which in isolation would pass beneath the radar of the newsworthy. Like Carson, Sinha has clearly grappled with the imaginative dilemmas posed by the diffusion of slow violence across environmental time. But his response is differently inﬂected, given that all the disasters he summons to mind had indeed been concentrated in a single community. The problem he tackled, moreover, was one Carson never addressed directly: how, through the mechanisms of globalization, environmental racism, and class discrimination, some afﬂicted communities are afforded more visibility—and more access to remediation—than others. This discriminatory distribution of environmental visibility—intranationally and transnationally—lies at the heart of Sinha's ﬁctional endeavor. Forty-ﬁve years ago, Carson protested that the scattershot victims of ""herbicides"" and ""pesticides"" ought to be recognized as victims of indiscriminate ""biocides"" instead (8). Sinha develops this idea of biocidal risk in terms redolent of Carson: one old woman, bent double by the poisons, upbraids the Kampani lawyer thus: ""you told us you were making medicine for the ﬁelds. You were making poisons to kill insects, but you killed us instead. I would like to ask, was there ever much difference, to you?"" (Animal's 306). Yet Sinha departs from Carson in representing ""pesticides"" as both indiscriminate and discriminatory: their killing power exceeds their targeted task of eliminating troublesome insects, but they do discriminate in the unadvertised sense of saddling the local and global poor with the highest burden of risk. Thus, by implication, the biocidal assault on human life is unevenly universal. Extraordinary Events, Ordinary Forgettings Looking back at Chernobyl, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bhopal, Petryna laments how ""many persons who have survived these largescale technological disasters have been caught in a long-term and vicious bureaucratic cycle in which they carry the burden of proof of their physical damage while experiencing the risk of being delegitimated in legal, welfare, and medical institutional contexts"" (216). Such people, above all the illiterate poor, are thrust into a labyrinth of self-fashioning as they seek to ﬁt their bodily stories to the story lines that dangle hope of recognition, possibly, though elusively, even recompense. In so doing, the poor face the double challenge of invisibility and amnesia: numerically they may constitute the majority, but they remain on the margins in terms of visibility and ofﬁcial memory. From an environmental perspective, this marginality is perpetuated, in part, by what Davis terms ""the dialectic of ordinary disaster,"" whereby a calamity is incorporated into history and rendered forgettably ordinary precisely because the burden of risk falls unequally on the unsheltered poor (""Los Angeles"" 227). Such disasters are readily dismissed from memory and policy planning by framing them as accidental, random, and unforeseeable acts of God, without regard for the precautionary measures that might have prevented the catastrophe or have mitigated its effects. At stake here is the role of neoliberal globalization in exacerbating both uneven economic development and the uneven development of ofﬁcial memory. What we witness is a kind of fatal bigotry that operates through the spatializing of time, by ofﬂoading risk onto ""backward"" communities that are barely visible in the ofﬁcial media. Contemporary global politics, then, must be recognized ""as a struggle for crude, material dominance, but also (threaded ever closer into that struggle) as a battle for the control over appearances"" (Boal 31). That battle over spectacle becomes especially decisive for public memory—and for the foresight with which public policy can motivate and execute precautionary measures—when it comes to the attritional casualties claimed, as at Bhopal, by the forces of slow violence.",summarize the following text: ,"environmentally embattled slum dwellers are hell-bent on immediate survival Their temporal element is ""now o'clock subject to the ﬁckle tyranny of the eternal today. the environmentally afﬂicted are bound in complex ways to past and future through the metamorphoses wrought by toxicity, the pursuit of social justice, and their collective relationship to apocalyptic time Global geopolitics has everything to fear from those with nothing to lose All things pass, but the poor remain.

Everything must be viewed with a double gaze, and can only be correctly understood and judged through this doubling. The world of the visible must be investigated, with respect to a second reality, only existent in thought and concealed in the world How do we subject that shadow kingdom to a temporal optic that might allow us to see the lineaments of slow terror behind the façade of sudden spectacle?

"3. From securitisation to militarisation 3.1 Complicity This analysis thus calls for a broader approach to environmental security based on retrieving the manner in which political actors construct discourses of ‘scarcity’ in response to ecological, energy and economic crises (critical security studies) in the context of the historically-specific socio-political and geopolitical relations of domination by which their power is constituted, and which are often implicated in the acceleration of these very crises (historical sociology and historical materialism). Instead, both realist and liberal orthodox IR approaches focus on different aspects of interstate behaviour, conflictual and cooperative respectively, but each lacks the capacity to grasp that the unsustainable trajectory of state and inter-state behaviour is only explicable in the context of a wider global system concurrently over-exploiting the biophysical environment in which it is embedded. They are, in other words, unable to address the relationship of the inter-state system itself to the biophysical environment as a key analytical category for understanding the acceleration of global crises. They simultaneously therefore cannot recognise the embeddedness of the economy in society and the concomitant politically-constituted nature of economics.84 Hence, they neglect the profound irrationality of collective state behaviour, which systematically erodes this relationship, globalising insecurity on a massive scale – in the very process of seeking security.85 In Cox’s words, because positivist IR theory ‘does not question the present order [it instead] has the effect of legitimising and reifying it’.86 Orthodox IR sanitises globally destructive collective inter-state behaviour as a normal function of instrumental reason – thus rationalising what are clearly deeply irrational collective human actions that threaten to permanently erode state power and security by destroying the very conditions of human existence. Indeed, the prevalence of orthodox IR as a body of disciplinary beliefs, norms and prescriptions organically conjoined with actual policy-making in the international system highlights the extent to which both realism and liberalism are ideologically implicated in the acceleration of global systemic crises.87 By the same token, the incapacity to recognise and critically interrogate how prevailing social, political and economic structures are driving global crisis acceleration has led to the proliferation of symptom-led solutions focused on the expansion of state/regime military–political power rather than any attempt to transform root structural causes.88 It is in this context that, as the prospects for meaningful reform through inter-state cooperation appear increasingly nullified under the pressure of actors with a vested interest in sustaining prevailing geopolitical and economic structures, states have resorted progressively more to militarised responses designed to protect the concurrent structure of the international system from dangerous new threats. In effect, the failure of orthodox approaches to accurately diagnose global crises, directly accentuates a tendency to ‘securitise’ them – and this, ironically, fuels the proliferation of violent conflict and militarisation responsible for magnified global insecurity. ‘Securitisation’ refers to a ‘speech act’ – an act of labelling – whereby political authorities identify particular issues or incidents as an existential threat which, because of their extreme nature, justify going beyond the normal security measures that are within the rule of law. It thus legitimises resort to special extra-legal powers. By labelling issues a matter of ‘security’, therefore, states are able to move them outside the remit of democratic decision-making and into the realm of emergency powers, all in the name of survival itself. Far from representing a mere aberration from democratic state practice, this discloses a deeper ‘dual’ structure of the state in its institutionalisation of the capacity to mobilise extraordinary extra-legal military– police measures in purported response to an existential danger.89  The problem in the context of global ecological, economic and energy crises is that such levels of emergency mobilisation and militarisation have no positive impact on the very global crises generating ‘new security challenges’, and are thus entirely disproportionate.90 All that remains to examine is on the ‘surface’ of the international system (geopolitical competition, the balance of power, international regimes, globalisation and so on), phenomena which are dislocated from their structural causes by way of being unable to recognise the biophysically-embedded and politically-constituted social relations of which they are comprised. The consequence is that orthodox IR has no means of responding to global systemic crises other than to reduce them to their symptoms. Indeed, orthodox IR theory has largely responded to global systemic crises not with new theory, but with the expanded application of existing theory to ‘new security challenges’ such as ‘low-intensity’ intra-state conflicts; inequality and poverty; environmental degradation; international criminal activities including drugs and arms trafficking; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and international terrorism.91 Although the majority of such ‘new security challenges’ are non-military in origin – whether their referents are states or individuals – the inadequacy of systemic theoretical frameworks to diagnose them means they are primarily examined through the lenses of military-political power.92 In other words, the escalation of global ecological, energy and economic crises is recognised not as evidence that the current organisation of the global political economy is fundamentally unsustainable, requiring urgent transformation, but as vindicating the necessity for states to radicalise the exertion of their military–political capacities to maintain existing power structures, to keep the lid on.93 Global crises are thus viewed as amplifying factors that could mobilise the popular will in ways that challenge existing political and economic structures, which it is presumed (given that state power itself is constituted by these structures) deserve protection. This justifies the state’s adoption of extra-legal measures outside the normal sphere of democratic politics. In the context of global crisis impacts, this counter-democratic trend-line can result in a growing propensity to problematise potentially recalcitrant populations – rationalising violence toward them as a control mechanism. 3.2 From theory to policy Consequently, for the most part, the policy implications of orthodox IR approaches involve a redundant conceptualisation of global systemic crises purely as potential ‘threat-multipliers’ of traditional security issues such as ‘political instability around the world, the collapse of governments and the creation of terrorist safe havens’. Climate change will serve to amplify the threat of international terrorism, particularly in regions with large populations and scarce resources.94 The US Army, for instance, depicts climate change as a ‘stress-multiplier’ that will ‘exacerbate tensions’ and ‘complicate American foreign policy’; while the EU perceives it as a ‘threat-multiplier which exacerbates existing trends, tensions and instability’.95  In practice, this generates an excessive preoccupation not with the causes of global crisis acceleration and how to ameliorate them through structural transformation, but with their purportedly inevitable impacts, and how to prepare for them by controlling problematic populations. Paradoxically, this ‘securitisation’ of global crises does not render us safer. Instead, by necessitating more violence, while inhibiting preventive action, it guarantees greater insecurity. Thus, a recent US Department of Defense report explores the future of international conflict up to 2050. It warns of ‘resource competition induced by growing populations and expanding economies’, particularly due to a projected ‘youth bulge’ in the South, which ‘will consume ever increasing amounts of food, water and energy’. This will prompt a ‘return to traditional security threats posed by emerging near-peers as we compete globally for depleting natural resources and overseas markets’. Finally, climate change will ‘compound’ these stressors by generating humanitarian crises, population migrations and other complex emergencies.96 A similar study by the US Joint Forces Command draws attention to the danger of global energy depletion through to 2030. Warning of ‘the dangerous vulnerabilities the growing energy crisis presents’, the report concludes that ‘The implications for future conflict are ominous.’97 Once again, the subject turns to demographics: ‘In total, the world will add approximately 60 million people each year and reach a total of 8 billion by the 2030s’, 95 per cent accruing to developing countries, while populations in developed countries slow or decline. ‘Regions such as the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, where the youth bulge will reach over 50% of the population, will possess fewer inhibitions about engaging in conflict.’98 The assumption is that regions which happen to be both energy-rich and Muslim-majority will also be sites of violent conflict due to their rapidly growing populations. A British Ministry of Defence report concurs with this assessment, highlighting an inevitable ‘youth bulge’ by 2035, with some 87 per cent of all people under the age of 25 inhabiting developing countries. In particular, the Middle East population will increase by 132 per cent and sub-Saharan Africa by 81 per cent. Growing resentment due to ‘endemic unemployment’ will be channelled through ‘political militancy, including radical political Islam whose concept of Umma, the global Islamic community, and resistance to capitalism may lie uneasily in an international system based on nation-states and global market forces’. More strangely, predicting an intensifying global divide between a super-rich elite, the middle classes and an urban under-class, the report warns: ‘The world’s middle classes might unite, using access to knowledge, resources and skills to shape transnational processes in their own class interest.’99 3.3 Exclusionary logics of global crisis securitisation? Thus, the securitisation of global crisis leads not only to the problematisation of particular religious and ethnic groups in foreign regions of geopolitical interest, but potentially extends this problematisation to any social group which might challenge prevailing global political economic structures across racial, national and class lines. The previous examples illustrate how securitisation paradoxically generates insecurity by reifying a process of militarisation against social groups that are constructed as external to the prevailing geopolitical and economic order. In other words, the internal reductionism, fragmentation and compartmentalisation that plagues orthodox theory and policy reproduces precisely these characteristics by externalising global crises from one another, externalising states from one another, externalising the inter-state system from its biophysical environment, and externalising new social groups as dangerous ‘outsiders’. Hence, a simple discursive analysis of state militarisation and the construction of new ‘outsider’ identities is insufficient to understand the causal dynamics driving the process of ‘Otherisation’. As Doug Stokes points out, the Western state preoccupation with the ongoing military struggle against international terrorism reveals an underlying ‘discursive complex’, where representations about terrorism and non-Western populations are premised on ‘the construction of stark boundaries’ that ‘operate to exclude and include’. Yet these exclusionary discourses are ‘intimately bound up with political and economic processes’, such as strategic interests in proliferating military bases in the Middle East, economic interests in control of oil, and the wider political goal of ‘maintaining American hegemony’ by dominating a resource-rich region critical for global capitalism.100 But even this does not go far enough, for arguably the construction of certain hegemonic discourses is mutually constituted by these geopolitical, strategic and economic interests – exclusionary discourses are politically constituted. New conceptual developments in genocide studies throw further light on this in terms of the concrete socio-political dynamics of securitisation processes. It is now widely recognised, for instance, that the distinguishing criterion of genocide is not the pre-existence of primordial groups, one of which destroys the other on the basis of a preeminence in bureaucratic military–political power. Rather, genocide is the intentional attempt to destroy a particular social group that has been socially constructed as different.101 As Hinton observes, genocides precisely constitute a process of ‘othering’ in which an imagined community becomes reshaped so that previously ‘included’ groups become ‘ideologically recast’ and dehumanised as threatening and dangerous outsiders, be it along ethnic, religious, political or economic lines – eventually legitimising their annihilation.102 In other words, genocidal violence is inherently rooted in a prior and ongoing ideological process, whereby exclusionary group categories are innovated, constructed and ‘Otherised’ in accordance with a specific socio-political programme. The very process of identifying and classifying particular groups as outside the boundaries of an imagined community of ‘inclusion’, justifying exculpatory violence toward them, is itself a political act without which genocide would be impossible.103 This recalls Lemkin’s recognition that the intention to destroy a group is integrally connected with a wider socio-political project – or colonial project – designed to perpetuate the political, economic, cultural and ideological relations of the perpetrators in the place of that of the victims, by interrupting or eradicating their means of social reproduction. Only by interrogating the dynamic and origins of this programme to uncover the social relations from which that programme derives can the emergence of genocidal intent become explicable.104 Building on this insight, Semelin demonstrates that the process of exclusionary social group construction invariably derives from political processes emerging from deep-seated sociopolitical crises that undermine the prevailing framework of civil order and social norms; and Conclusions While recommendations to shift our frame of orientation away from conventional state-centrism toward a ‘human security’ approach are valid, this cannot be achieved without confronting the deeper theoretical assumptions underlying conventional approaches to ‘non-traditional’ security issues.106 By occluding the structural origin and systemic dynamic of global ecological, energy and economic crises, orthodox approaches are incapable of transforming them. Coupled with their excessive state-centrism, this means they operate largely at the level of ‘surface’ impacts of global crises in terms of how they will affect quite traditional security issues relative to sustaining state integrity, such as international terrorism, violent conflict and population movements. Global crises end up fuelling the projection of risk onto social networks, groups and countries that cross the geopolitical fault-lines of these ‘surface’ impacts – which happen to intersect largely with Muslim communities. Hence, regions particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts, containing large repositories of hydrocarbon energy resources, or subject to demographic transformations in the context of rising population pressures, have become the focus of state security planning in the context of counter-terrorism operations abroad. The intensifying problematisation and externalisation of Muslim-majority regions and populations by Western security agencies – as a discourse – is therefore not only interwoven with growing state perceptions of global crisis acceleration, but driven ultimately by an epistemological failure to interrogate the systemic causes of this acceleration in collective state policies (which themselves occur in the context of particular social, political and economic structures). This expansion of militarisation is thus coeval with the subliminal normative presumption that the social relations of the perpetrators, in this case Western states, must be protected and perpetuated at any cost – precisely because the efficacy of the prevailing geopolitical and economic order is ideologically beyond question. As much as this analysis highlights a direct link between global systemic crises, social polarisation and state militarisation, it fundamentally undermines the idea of a symbiotic link between natural resources and conflict per se. Neither ‘resource shortages’ nor ‘resource abundance’ (in ecological, energy, food and monetary terms) necessitate conflict by themselves. There are two key operative factors that determine whether either condition could lead to conflict. The first is the extent to which either condition can generate socio-political crises that challenge or undermine the prevailing order. The second is the way in which stakeholder actors choose to actually respond to the latter crises. To understand these factors accurately requires close attention to the political, economic and ideological strictures of resource exploitation, consumption and distribution between different social groups and classes. Overlooking the systematic causes of social crisis leads to a heightened tendency to problematise its symptoms, in the forms of challenges from particular social groups. This can lead to externalisation of those groups, and the legitimisation of violence towards them. Ultimately, this systems approach to global crises strongly suggests that conventional policy ‘reform’ is woefully inadequate. Global warming and energy depletion are manifestations of a civilisation which is in overshoot. The current scale and organisation of human activities is breaching the limits of the wider environmental and natural resource systems in which industrial civilisation is embedded. This breach is now increasingly visible in the form of two interlinked crises in global food production and the global financial system. In short, industrial civilisation in its current form is unsustainable. This calls for a process of wholesale civilisational transition to adapt to the inevitable arrival of the post-carbon era through social, political and economic transformation. Yet conventional theoretical and policy approaches fail to (1) fully engage with the gravity of research in the natural sciences and (2) translate the social science implications of this research in terms of the embeddedness of human social systems in natural systems. Hence, lacking capacity for epistemological self-reflection and inhibiting the transformative responses urgently required, they reify and normalise mass violence against diverse ‘Others’, newly constructed as traditional security threats enormously amplified by global crises – a process that guarantees the intensification and globalisation of insecurity on the road to ecological, energy and economic catastrophe. Such an outcome, of course, is not inevitable, but extensive new transdisciplinary research in IR and the wider social sciences – drawing on and integrating human and critical security studies, political ecology, historical sociology and historical materialism, while engaging directly with developments in the natural sciences – is urgently required to develop coherent conceptual frameworks which could inform more sober, effective, and joined-up policy-making on these issues.",summarize the following text: ,"orthodox IR approaches focus on different aspects of interstate behaviour,

"The classic social contract, as I have detailed, is primarily moral/political in nature. But it is also economic in the background sense that the point of leaving the state of nature is in part to secure a stable environment for the industrious appropriation of the world. (After all, one famous definition of politics is that it is about who gets what and why.) Thus even in Locke's moralized state of nature, where people generally do obey natural law, he is concerned about the safety of private property, indeed proclaiming that ""the great and chief end therefore, of Mens uniting into Commonwealths, and putting themselves under Government, is the Preservation of their Property.""42 And in Hobbes's famously amoral and unsafe state of nature, we are told that ""there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth.""43 So part of the point of bringing society into existence, with its laws and enforcers of the law, is to protect what you have accumulated. / What, then, is the nature of the economic system of the new society? The general contract does not itself prescribe a particular model or particular schedule of property rights, requiring only that the ""equality"" in the prepolitical state be somehow preserved. This provision may be variously interpreted as a self-interested surrender to an absolutist Hobbesian government that itself determines property rights, or a Lockean insistence that private property accumulated in the moralized state of nature be respected by the constitutionalist government. Or more radical political theorists, such as socialists and feminists, might argue that state-of-nature equality actually mandates class or gender economic egalitarianism in society. So, different political interpretations of the initial moral egalitarianism can be advanced, but the general background idea is that the equality of human beings in the state of nature is somehow (whether as equality of opportunity or as equality of outcome) supposed to carry over into the economy of the created sociopolitical order, leading to a system of voluntary human intercourse and exchange in which exploitation is precluded. / By contrast, the economic dimension of the Racial Contract is the most salient, foreground rather than background, since the Racial Contract is calculatedly aimed at economic exploitation. The whole point of establishing a moral hierarchy and juridically partitioning the polity according to race is to secure and legitimate the privileging of those individuals designated as white/persons and the exploitation of those individuals designated as nonwhite/subpersons. There are other benefits accruing from the Racial Contract—far greater political influence, cultural hegemony, the psychic payoff that comes from knowing one is a member of the Herrenvolk (what W. E. B. Du Bois once called ""the wages of whiteness"")44—but the bottom line is material advantage. Globally, the Racial Contract creates Europe as the continent that dominates the world; locally, within Europe and the other continents, it designates Europeans as the privileged race. / The challenge of explaining what has been called ""the European miracle""—the rise of Europe to global domination—has long exercised both academic and lay opinion.45 How is it that a formerly peripheral region on the outskirts of the Asian land mass, at the far edge of the trade routes, remote from the great civilizations of Islam and the East, was able in a century or two to achieve global political and economic dominance? The explanations historically given by Europeans themselves have varied tremendously, from the straightforwardly racist and geographically determinist to the more subtly environmentalist and culturalist. But what they have all had in common, even those influenced by Marxism, is their tendency to depict this development as essentially autochthonous, their tendency to privilege some set of internal variables and correspondingly-downplay or ignore altogether the role of colonial conquest and African slavery. Europe made it on its own, it is said, because of the peculiar characteristics of Europe and Europeans. / Thus whereas no reputable historian today would espouse the frankly biologistic theories of the past, which made Europeans (in both pre- and post-Darwinian accounts) inherently the most advanced race, as contrasted with the backward/less-evolved races elsewhere, the thesis of European specialness and exceptionalism is still presupposed. It is still assumed that rationalism and science, innovativeness and inventiveness found their special home here, as against the intellectual stagnation and traditionalism of the rest of the world, so that Europe was therefore destined in advance to occupy the special position in global history it has. James Blaut calls this the theory, or ""super-theory"" (an umbrella covering many different versions: theological, cultural, biologistic, geographical, technological, etc.), of ""Eurocentric diffusionism,"" according to which European progress is seen as ""natural"" and asymmetrically determinant of the fate of non-Europe."" Similarly, Sandra Harding, in her anthology on the ""racial"" economy of science, cites ""the assumption that Europe functions autonomously from other parts of the world; that Europe is its own origin, final end, and agent; and that Europe and people of European descent in the Americas and elsewhere owe nothing to the rest of the world.""47 / Unsurprisingly, black and Third World theorists have traditionally dissented from this notion of happy divine or natural European dispensation. They have claimed, quite to the contrary, that there is a crucial causal connection between European advance and the unhappy fate of the rest of the world. One classic example of such scholarship from a half century ago was the Caribbean historian Eric Williams's Capitalism and Slavery, which argued that the profits from African slavery helped to make the industrial revolution possible, so that internalist accounts were fundamentally mistaken.48 And in recent years, with decolonization, the rise of the New Left in the United States, and the entry of more alternative voices into the academy, this challenge has deepened and broadened. There are variations in the authors' positions—for example, Walter Rodney, Samir Amin, Andre Guilder Frank, Immanuel Wallerstein9—but the basic theme is that the exploitation of the empire (the bullion from the great gold and silver mines in Mexico and Peru, the profits from plantation slavery, the fortunes made by the colonial companies, the general social and economic stimulus provided by the opening up of the ""New World"") was to a greater or lesser extent crucial in enabling and then consolidating the takeoff of what had previously been an economic backwater. It was far from the case that Europe was specially destined to assume economic hegemony; there were a number of centers in Asia and Africa of a comparable level of development which could potentially have evolved in the same way. But the European ascent closed off this development path for others because it forcibly inserted them into a colonial network whose exploitative relations and extractive mechanisms prevented autonomous growth. / Overall, then, colonialism ""lies at the heart"" of the rise of Europe.50 The economic unit of analysis needs to be Europe as a whole, since it is not always the case that the colonizing nations directly involved always benefited in the long term. Imperial Spain, for example, still feudal in character, suffered massive inflation from its bullion imports. But through trade and financial exchange, others launched on the capitalist path, such as Holland, profited. Internal national rivalries continued, of course, but this common identity based on the transcontinental exploitation of the non-European world would in many cases be politically crucial, generating a sense of Europe as a cosmopolitan entity engaged in a common enterprise, underwritten by race. As Victor Kiernan puts it, ""All countries within the European orbit benefited however, as Adam Smith pointed out, from colonial contributions to a common stock of wealth, bitterly as they might wrangle over ownership of one territory or another... [T]here was a sense in which all Europeans shared in a heightened sense of power engendered by the successes of any of them, as well as in the pool of material wealth... that the colonies produced.""51 / Today, correspondingly, though formal decolonization has taken place and in Africa and Asia black, brown, and yellow natives are in office, ruling independent nations, the global economy is essentially dominated by the former colonial powers, their offshoots (Euro-United States, Euro-Canada), and their international financial institutions, lending agencies, and corporations. (As previously observed, the notable exception, whose history confirms rather than challenges the rule, is Japan, which escaped colonization and, after the Meiji Restoration, successfully embarked on its own industrialization.) Thus one could say that the world is essentially dominated by white capital.
Global figures on income and property ownership are, of course, broken down nationally rather than racially, but if a transnational racial disaggregation were to be done, it would reveal that whites control a percentage of the world's wealth grossly disproportionate to their numbers. Since there is no reason to think that the chasm between First and Third Worlds (which largely coincides with this racial division) is going to be bridged—vide the abject failure of various United Nations plans from the ""development decade"" of the 1960s onward—it seems undeniable that for years to come, the planet will be white dominated. With the collapse of communism and the defeat of Third World attempts to seek alternative paths, the West reigns supreme, as celebrated in a London Financial Times headline: ""The fall of the Soviet bloc has left the IMF and G7 to rule the world and create a new imperial age.""52 Economic structures have been set in place, causal processes established, whose outcome is to pump wealth from one side of the globe to another, and which will continue to work largely independently of the ill will/good will, racist/antiracist feelings of particular individuals. This globally color-coded distribution of wealth and poverty has been produced by the Racial Contract and in turn reinforces adherence to it in its signatories and beneficiaries. / Moreover, it is not merely that Europe and the former white settler states are globally dominant but that within them, where there is a significant nonwhite presence (indigenous peoples, descendants of imported slaves, voluntary nonwhite immigration), whites continue to be privileged vis-a-vis non-whites. The old structures of formal, de jure exclusion have largely been dismantled, the old explicitly biologistic ideologies largely abandoned53—the Racial Contract, as will be discussed later, is continually being rewritten—but opportunities for nonwhites, though they have expanded, remain below those for whites. The claim is not, of course, that all whites are better off than all nonwhites, but that, as a statistical generalization, the objective life chances of whites are significantly better. / As an example, consider the United States. A series of books has recently documented the decline of the integrationist hopes raised by the 1960s and the growing intransigence and hostility of whites who think they have ""done enough,"" despite the fact that the country continues to be massively segregated, median black family incomes have begun falling by comparison to white family incomes after some earlier closing of the gap, the so-called ""black underclass"" has basically been written off, and reparations for slavery and post-Emancipation discrimination have never been paid, or, indeed, even seriously considered.54 Recent work on racial inequality by Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro suggests that wealth is more important than income in determining the likelihood of future racial equalization, since it has a cumulative effect that is passed down through intergenerational transfer, affecting life chances and opportunities for one's children. Whereas in 1988 black households earned sixty two cents for every dollar earned by white households, the comparative differential with regard to wealth is much greater and, arguably, provides a more realistically negative picture of the prospects for closing the racial gap: ""Whites possess nearly twelve times as much median net worth as blacks,or $43,800 versus $3,700. In an even starker contrast, perhaps, the average white household controls $6,999 in net financial assets while the average black household retains no NFA nest egg whatsoever."" Moreover, the analytic focus on wealth rather than income exposes how illusory the much-trumpeted rise of a ""black middle class"" is: ""Middle class blacks, for example, earn seventy cents for every dollar earned by middle-class whites but they possess only fifteen cents for every dollar of wealth held by middle-class whites."" This huge disparity in white and black wealth is not remotely contingent, accidental, fortuitous; it is the direct outcome of American state policy and the collusion with it of the white citizenry. In effect, ""materially, whites and blacks constitute two nations,""55 the white nation being constituted by the American Racial Contract in a relationship of structured racial exploitation with the black (and, of course, historically also the red) nation. / A collection of papers from panels organized in the 1980s by the National Economic Association, the professional organization of black economists, provides some insight into the mechanics and the magnitude of such exploitative transfers and denials of opportunity to accumulate material and human capital. It takes as its title The Wealth of Races—an ironic tribute to Adam Smith's famous book The Wealth of Nations–and analyzes the different varieties of discrimination to which blacks have been subjected: slavery, employment discrimination, wage discrimination, promotion discrimination, white monopoly power discrimination against black capital, racial price discrimination in consumer goods, housing, services, insurance, etc.56 Many of these, by their very nature, are difficult to quantify; moreover, there are costs in anguish and suffering that can never really be compensated. Nonetheless, those that do lend themselves to calculation offer some remarkable figures. (The figures are unfortunately dated; readers should multiply by a factor that takes fifteen years of inflation into account.) If one were to do a calculation of the cumulative benefits (through compound interest) from labor market discrimination over the forty-year period from 1929 to 1969 and adjust for inflation, then in 1983 dollars, the figure would be over $1.6 trillion.57 An estimate for the total of ""diverted income"" from slavery, 1790 to 1860, compounded and translated into 1983 dollars, would yield the sum of $2.1 trillion to $4.7 trillion.58 And if one were to try to work out the cumulative value, with compound interest, of unpaid slave labor before 1863, underpayment since 1863, and denial of opportunity to acquire land and natural resources available to white settlers, then the total amount required to compensate blacks ""could take more than the entire wealth of the United States""59 / So this gives an idea of the centrality of racial exploitation to the U.S. economy and the dimensions of the payoff for its white beneficiaries from one nation's Racial Contract. But this very centrality, these very dimensions render the topic taboo, virtually undiscussed in the debates on justice of most white political theory. If there is such a backlash against affirmative action, what would the response be to the demand for the interest on the unpaid forty acres and a mule? These issues cannot be raised because they go to the heart of the real nature of the polity and its structuring by the Racial Contract. White moral theory's debates on justice in the state must therefore inevitably have a somewhat farcical air, since they ignore the central injustice on which the state rests. (No wonder a hypothetical contractarianism that evades the actual circumstances of the polity's founding is preferred!) / Both globally and within particular nations, then, white people, Europeans and their descendants, continue to benefit from the Racial Contract, which creates a world in their cultural image, political states differentially favoring their interests, an economy structured around the racial exploitation of others, and a moral psychology (not just in whites but sometimes in nonwhites also) skewed consciously or unconsciously toward privileging them, taking the status quo of differential racial entitlement as normatively legitimate, and not to be investigated further.
A totalizing approach to capitalism denies its very vulnerability – tanks alt solvency and proves the perm is best

(Katharine and Julie, The End of Capitalism (As We Know It), p. 263-64)
One of our goals as Marxists has been to produce a knowledge of capitalism.  Yet as “that which is known,” Capitalism has become the intimate enemy.  We have uncloaked the ideologically-clothed, obscure monster, but we have installed a naked and visible monster in its place.  In return for our labors of creation, the monster has robbed us of all force.  We hear – and find it easy to believe – that the left is in disarray.  Part of what produces the disarray of the left is the vision of what the left is arrayed against.  When capitalism is represented as a unified system coextensive with the nation or even the world, when it is portrayed as crowding out all other economic forms, when it is allowed to define entire societies, it becomes something that can only be defeated and replaced by a mass collective movement (or by a process of systemic dissolution that such a movement might assist).  The revolutionary task of replacing capitalism now seems outmoded and unrealistic, yet we do not seem to have an alternative conception of class transformation to take its place. The old political economic “systems” and “structures” that call forth a vision of revolution as systemic replacement still seem to be dominant in the Marxist political imagination.  The New World Order is often represented as political fragmentation founded upon economic unification.  In this vision the economy appears as the last stronghold of unity and singularity in a world of diversity and plurality.  But why can’t the economy be fragmented too?  If we theorized it as fragmented in the United States, we could being to see a huge state sector (incorporating a variety of forms of appropriation of surplus labor), a very large sector of self-employed and family-based producers (most noncapitalist), a huge household sector (again, quite various in terms of forms of exploitation, with some households moving towards communal or collective appropriation and others operating in a traditional mode in which one adult appropriates surplus labor from another).  None of these things is easy to see.  If capitalism takes up the available social space, there’s no room for anything else.  If capitalism cannot coexist, there’s no possibility of anything else.  If capitalism functions as a unity, it cannot be partially or locally replaced.  My intent is to help create the discursive conception under which socialist or other noncapitalist construction becomes “realistic” present activity rather than a ludicrous or utopian goal.  To achieve this I must smash Capitalism and see it in a thousand pieces.  I must make its unity a fantasy, visible as a denial of diversity and change.",summarize the following text: ,"The classic social contract is also economic in the background sense that the point of leaving the state of nature is in part to secure a stable environment for the industrious appropriation of the world. So part of the point of bringing society into existence, with its laws and enforcers of the law, is to protect what you have accumulated. different political interpretations of the initial moral egalitarianism can be advanced, but the general background idea is that the equality of human beings in the state of nature is somehow supposed to carry over into the economy of the created sociopolitical order, leading to a system of voluntary human intercourse and exchange in which exploitation is precluded. By contrast, the economic dimension of the Racial Contract is the most salient, foreground rather than background, since the Racial Contract is calculatedly aimed at economic exploitation. The whole point of establishing a moral hierarchy and juridically partitioning the polity according to race is to secure and legitimate the privileging of those individuals designated as white/persons and the exploitation of those individuals designated as nonwhite/subpersons. Globally, the Racial Contract creates Europe as the continent that dominates the world; locally, within Europe and the other continents, it designates Europeans as the privileged race. The challenge of explaining the rise of Europe to global domination has long exercised both academic and lay opinion. How is it that a formerly peripheral region on the outskirts of the Asian land mass, at the far edge of the trade routes, remote from the great civilizations of Islam and the East, was able in a century or two to achieve global political and economic dominance? explanations historically given have varied tremendously, from the straightforwardly racist and geographically determinist to the more subtly environmentalist and culturalist.

"Dealing with communist North Korea has become one of the most difficult challenges in global politics today. Totalitarian and reclusive, ideologically isolated and economically ruined, it is the inherent 'other' in a globalized and neoliberal world order. And yet North Korea goes on surviving, not least because its leaders periodically rely on threats to gain concessions from the international community. The latest such attempt was signalled in the autumn of 2002, when Pyongyang admitted to a secret nuclear weapons programme and subsequently withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT). Thereafter the situation rapidly deteriorated. By early 2003 both the US and North Korea were threatening each other with outright war. Even Japan, adopting its most militaristic posture in decades, publicly contemplated the possibility of a pre-emptive strike against North Korea.3 The dangers of North Korea's nuclear brinkmanship are evident. Miscalculation or a sudden escalation of tension could precipitate a human disaster at any moment. Equally dangerous, although much less evident, are the confrontational and militaristic attitudes with which some of the key regional and global players, most notably the United States, seek to contain the situation. The problems associated with these approaches have been largely obscured by Washington's apparent willingness to de-escalate the crisis through negotiations. 'I believe this is not a military show-down,' stressed President George W. Bush. 'This is a diplomatic show down.'4 Much has been made of the difference between this tolerant approach and the far more aggressive stance taken in respect of Iraq, where war was presented as the only possibility of preventing a dangerous escalationtowardsthe use by the Baghdadregime of weapons of massdestruction. The situation was particularly paradoxical since Pyongyang publicly admitted to its nuclear ambition and asked inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to leave the country. Baghdad, by contrast, denied possessing weapons of mass destruction and admitted inspectors for the specific purpose of verifying its claims.5 The reluctance to use force against North Korea obscures the fact that US foreign policy is guided by a largely consistent approach towards the phenomenon of so-called 'rogue' states. That war was not advocated in Korea is a reflection of diplomatic constraints and, above all, strategic limitations. South Korea's then newly elected president, Roh Moo-hyun, strongly opposed a military solution to the problem. Perhaps even more importantly, the consequences of an escalation in Korea would be hard to contain. One of the world's biggest cities, Seoul, is only 50 kilometres away from the heavily militarized 'Demilitarized Zone'(DMZ) that separatesNorth Korea from the South. Even if pre-emptive strikes were to neutralize North Korea's possible nuclear arsenal, they would not be able to destroy all its conventional weapons. The latter alone could easily trigger a second Korean war, with disastrous consequences on all sides. The purpose of this article is to examine the role of the United States in the Korean nuclear crisis, for no aspect of the past and present dilemmas on the peninsula can be addressed or even understood without recourse to the US. This is why China repeatedly stressed that the latest nuclear crisis was primarily an issue between North Korea and the United States.6 Kim Dae-jung, in his final speech as South Korea's president, reiterated the same theme: 'more than anything, dialogue between North Korea and the United States is the important key to a solution.'7 A solution is, however, far from reach. Both the US and North Korea see the other as a threat. And each has good reasons for doing so. But each is also implicated in the production of this threat. The problem is that these interactive dynamics are hard to see, for the West tends to project a very one-sided image of North Korea-one that sees it solely as a rogue outlaw, and thus a source of danger and instability. Nicolas Eberstadt, for instance, stresses that 'North Korean policies and practices have accounted for most of the volatility within the Northeast Asian region since the end of the Cold War.'8 Very few policy-makers, security analysts and journalists ever make the effort to imagine how threats are perceived from the North Korean perspective, or consider how these perceptions are part of an interactive security dilemma in which the West, and US foreign policy in particular, is implicated as deeply as the vilified regime in Pyongyang. The central argument of this article is that the image of North Korea as a 'rogue state' severely hinders both an adequate understanding and a possible resolution of the crisis. The rhetoric of rogue states is indicative of how US foreign policy continues to be driven by dualistic and militaristic Cold War thinking patterns. The 'Evil Empire' may be gone; not so the underlying need to define safety and security with reference to an external threat that must be warded off at any cost. Rogues are among the new threat-images that serve to demarcate the line between good and evil. As during the Cold War, military means are considered the key tool with which this line is to be defended. In the absence of a global power that matches the US, this militaristic attitude has, if anything, even intensified. Look at Washington's recent promulgation of a pre-emptive strike policy against rogue states. The consequences of this posture are particularly fateful in Korea, for it reinforces half a century of explicit and repeated nuclear threats against the government in Pyongyang. The impact of these threats has been largely obscured, not least because the highly technical and specialized discourse of security analysis has enabled the US to present the strategic situation on the peninsula in a manner that misleadingly attributes responsibility for the crisis solely to North Korea's actions. A brief disclaimer is in order at this point. I offer neither a comprehensive review of the Korean security situation nor a detailed analysis of the latest events. As a result, there will be little mention of some admittedly crucial issues, such as the role of China or the increasingly problematic rift between Washington and Seoul. Instead, I identify broad patterns of conflict and embark on a con- ceptual engagement with some of the ensuing dilemmas. Focusing on underlying trends inevitably entails glossing over nuances at times. For instance, there are heated debates between hawks and doves within Washington's policy circles, and as a result periods dominated by hard-line realist positions have alternated with periods during which softer and more liberal policies prevailed. But the persistent pattern of seeing North Korea as a rogue state is far more striking, and in many ways far more significant, than the strategic policy manoeuvring that takes place within these patterns. Focusing on the big picture also entails departing from some of the conventions that prevail in the field of strategic and security studies. Contrary to most treatments of the subject, I do not discuss the technical aspects of nuclear and other weapons, except to show, as indicated above, how these very discussions,jargon-ridden and inaccessible as they are to any but military experts, often serve to stifle debate about some of the underly- ing political and ethical issues.9
Contemporary proliferation rhetoric that focuses on the security implications shapes our responses to it by promoting militarized responses focused on security.

The Cold War security environment was thought of in terms of bipolarity and of Cold War. This image defined and ordered security problems—indeed, much of the new thinking in international security is a reaction against the exclusion and marginalization of other concerns by this image. In large part the tasks of definition and ordering are performed by the metaphorical content of the security images. Images comprise a series of metaphors, which shape our understanding of policy problems and thereby inform the solutions that are, and are not, attempted. In this chapter 1 consider one of the central images that is emerging from the rethinking of international security, the image of proliferation. I will show how this image is being constructed in the discourse and practice of (particularly Western) states. I will also examine the metaphors that are contained in the image and show how they are informing a particular, and flawed, policy response. REIMAGINING INTERNATIONAL SECURITY One noted and useful example of the rethinking of international security was provided by Charles Krauthammer, in the journal of record of the U.S. foreign policy elite, Foreign Affairs, in early 1991. He was responding directly to the collapse of the bipolar image of the Cold War: “Ever since it became clear that an exhausted Soviet Union was calling off the Cold War, the quest has been on for a new American role in the world. Roles, however, are not invented in the abstract; they are a response to a perceived world structure.”1 The structure Krauthammer perceived following bipolarity was a “unipolar moment.” In addition to redefining international security in terms of unipolarity, Krauthammer also gave an early statement of the proliferation problem as it would come to be understood: The post-Cold War era is thus perhaps better called the era of weapons of mass destruction. The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery will constitute the greatest single threat to world security for the rest of our lives. That is what makes a new international order not an imperial dream or a Wilsonian fantasy but a matter of the sheerest prudence. It is slowly dawning on the West that there is a need to establish some new regime to police these weapons and those who brandish them.2 Krauthammer’s article appeared as a United States-led coalition was using Iraq as a test range for its assortment of weapons of all kinds of destruction. The aftermath of this war in the Gulf saw the West pick up the pace of their realization that longer-term action was needed to address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. In addition, the massive conventional army that Iraq deployed (admittedly to little effect) was seen to tie conventional weapons to this new security agenda. Proliferation thus came to be seen as a wide-ranging problem, encompassing not only the spread of nuclear weapons, but of chemical and biological weapons, as well as the diffusion of conventional arms. Not only did Krauthammer sound the warning on proliferation, but he also foresaw the elements of a response to this new threat, a response that would be developed by the West in the years following the Gulf War: Any solution will have to include three elements: denying, disarming, and defending. First, we will have to develop a new regime, similar to COCOM (Coordinating Committee on Export Controls) to deny yet more high technology to such states. Second, those states that acquire such weapons anyway will have to submit to strict outside control or risk being physically disarmed. A final element must be the development of antiballistic missile and air defense systems to defend against those weapons that do escape Western control or preemption.3 Over the next four years, Western states have paid increasing attention to the various problems of proliferation and developed response strategies that can be well characterized as “denying, disarming, and defending.” The first line of attack is a regime based on technology denial. The COCOM was formally dissolved in March 1994, and its members have now joined with most of the states of former Eastern Europe in a new export-control regime for conventional weapons and related technologies. Preliminary agreement was reached in September 1995 among twenty-eight states, and what is being called the Wassenaar Arrangement was formally created in April 1996.4 More generally, regimes of technology denial are the foundation of the nonproliferation effort. Consider the communique of the North Atlantic Council, announcing an “Alliance Policy Framework on Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction” (9 June 1994): 3. Current international efforts focus on the prevention of WMD and missile proliferation through a range of international treaties and regimes....5 4. The aforementioned treaties are complemented on the supply side by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Zangger Committee, the Australia Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime. These regimes should be reinforced through the broadest possible adherence to them and enhancement of their effectiveness.6 The creation of the Wassenaar Arrangement means that there are in place technology-denial regimes for the three weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, chemical, and biological), missile-delivery systems, and conventional arms. With the exception of missile systems, there will also be some form of international mechanism addressing the spread of each of these technologies as well, as the United Nations has created a Register of Conventional Arms. Technology denial is the backbone of the response to proliferation. At least in the case of Iraq, however, attempts have also been made to respond to proliferation through enforced disarmament. On 9 April 1991 the UN Security Council passed Resolution 687, which outlined the forcible disarmament of Iraq. It mandated a Special Commission (UNSCOM) that, together with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), would oversee the declaration and destruction of the Iraqi chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons holdings and production capabilities, as well as their missile technology.7 Similarly, through May and June of 1994, North Korea was threatened with international sanction, and possible military conflict with South Korea and the United States, if it did not allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities. The final element, particularly in the United States, of a security policy to counter proliferation has been the development of military capabilities to defend against what has come to be called the post— proliferation environment. The recent U.S. threats of violence in the case of North Korea are one example of such a military response forming part of the reaction to the problem of proliferation. A second is found in the NATO declaration from which I quoted above: 12. Recent events in Iraq and North Korea have demonstrated that WMD proliferation can occur despite international non- proliferation norms and agreements. As a defensive Alliance, NATO must therefore address the military capabilities needed to discourage WMD proliferation and use, and if necessary, to protect NATO territory, populations and forces. 13. NATO will therefore...seek, if necessary, to improve defense capabilities of NATO and its members to protect NATO territory, populations and forces against WMD use, based on assessments of threats (including non-State actors), Allied military doctrine and planning, and Allied military capabilities.8 It would seem, then, that it has dawned on the West that proliferation is a serious security problem. Indeed, in January 1992, an unprecedented summit meeting of the UN Security Council declared proliferation—in its new, comprehensive guise—a threat to international peace and security, opening the way for multilateral military action to respond to proliferation, under the terms of the United Nations’ Charter: The members of the Council underline the need for all member states to fulfil their obligations in relation to arms control and disarmament; to prevent the proliferation in all its aspects of all weapons of mass destruction; to avoid excessive and destabilizing accumulations and transfers of arms, and to resolve peacefully in accordance with the Charter any problems concerning these matters threatening or disrupting the maintenance of regional and global stability.... The proliferation of all weapons of mass destruction constitutes a threat to international peace and security. The members of the Council commit themselves to working to prevent the spread of technology related to the research for or production of such weapons and to take appropriate action to that end.9 This statement contains all of the key elements of the new image of proliferation in international security: a problem of all forms of weapons of mass destruction and of “excessive and destabilizing” accumulations of conventional arms. This image has been deepened and developed in the pronouncements and practices of (particularly Western) policy makers since the end of the Gulf War.10 The importance of this new image is reflected in the academic literature on foreign and security problems. I conducted a review of the issues between 1985 and 1994 in five of the leading U.S. foreign policy journals, journals that reflect and inform the policy debate within the United States. This review bears out the contention advanced here that proliferation is a problem enunciated to fill the gap left by the Cold War and catalyzed by the experience in the Gulf. There were only seven articles on the problem between 1985 and the fall of the Berlin Wall, of which five were concerned with nuclear proliferation. There were nine articles in the year between 1989 and the Gulf War. In the three years following the end of the Gulf War, there were fifty—six articles in these journals that were concerned with proliferation.11In addition to the new image, there is also a clear pattern to the strategy being employed in response. It is a three—tiered strategy, anchored at the global level by formal multilateral nonproliferation arrangements. At present there are four such arrangements: the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the Chemical Weapons Convention (cwc), the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC), and the UN Register of Conventional Arms. This leaves only missile technology (of the identified concerns), without a global arrangement but only a supplier—control regime, the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).12 The second tier of the control strategy is a collection of supplier—control regimes. The MTCR is joined by the Australia Group, which controls chemical and biological technology, the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) and the Zangger Committee, which controls nuclear technology, and the Wassenaar Arrangement, which is to control conventional and dual-use technology. Finally, these supplier controls are implemented nationally by export-control systems. The international security environment is thus being reimagined. The image that guided international security policy and scholarship during the Cold War has given way to a new image centered on proliferation. This image is informing both policy and academic debate and is found reflected in the instruments and institutions of international arms control and security, as well as in the written record of the academy. What are the implications of this image? How can we understand the way in which this image informs policy, reshaping instruments, institutions, and even interests? The images of security comprise a number of metaphors that shape our thinking about problems and solutions; in the present case, the key metaphors are “proliferation,” “stability,” and its related metaphor “balance.” In order to consider the role that image plays in international security, it is necessary to appreciate the way in which metaphors constitute our understandings and thereby inform the conception we hold of a policy problem, and the solutions we develop to address that problem.",summarize the following text: ,"Dealing with North Korea has become one of the most difficult challenges in global politics today it is the inherent 'other' in a globalized and neoliberal world order Pyongyang withdrew from the NPT he situation rapidly deteriorated. By early 2003 both the US and North Korea were threatening each other with outright war. Even Japan, adopting its most militaristic posture in decades, publicly contemplated the possibility of a pre-emptive strike against North Korea Miscalculation or a sudden escalation of tension could precipitate a human disaster at any moment. Equally dangerous, although much less evident, are the confrontational and militaristic attitudes with which some of the key regional and global players, most notably the United States, seek to contain the situation. The problems associated with these approaches have been largely obscured by Washington's apparent willingness to de-escalate the crisis through negotiations The reluctance to use force against North Korea obscures the fact that US foreign policy is guided by a largely consistent approach towards the phenomenon of so-called 'rogue' states. That war was not advocated in Korea is a reflection of strategic limitations the consequences of an escalation in Korea would be hard to contain Even if pre-emptive strikes were to neutralize North Korea's possible nuclear arsenal, they would not be able to destroy all its conventional weapons Both the US and North Korea see the other as a threat each is also implicated in the production of this threat these interactive dynamics are hard to see, for the West tends to project a very one-sided image of North Korea-one that sees it solely as a rogue outlaw, and thus a source of danger and instability Very few policy-makers, security analysts and journalists ever make the effort to imagine how threats are perceived from the North Korean perspective, or consider how these perceptions are part of an interactive security dilemma in which the West, and US foreign policy in particular, is implicated as deeply as the vilified regime in Pyongyang. the image of North Korea as a 'rogue state' severely hinders both an adequate understanding and a possible resolution of the crisis. The rhetoric of rogue states is indicative of how US foreign policy continues to be driven by dualistic and militaristic Cold War thinking patterns underlying need to define security with reference to an external threat that must be warded off at any cost. Rogues are among the new threat-images that serve to demarcate the line between good and evil. Look at Washington's recent promulgation of a pre-emptive strike policy against rogue states. The consequences of this posture are particularly fateful in Korea, for it reinforces half a century of explicit and repeated nuclear threats against the government in Pyongyang. The impact of these threats has been largely obscured because the highly technical and specialized discourse of security analysis has enabled the US to present the strategic situation on the peninsula in a manner that misleadingly attributes responsibility for the crisis solely to North Korea's actions the persistent pattern of seeing North Korea as a rogue state is far more striking, and in many ways far more significant, than the strategic policy manoeuvring that takes place within these patterns. Focusing on the big picture also entails departing from some of the conventions that prevail in the field of strategic and security studies.

the tasks of definition and ordering are performed by the metaphorical content of the security images. Images comprise a series of metaphors, which shape our understanding of policy problems and thereby inform the solutions the central images that is emerging from the rethinking of international security, the image of proliferation is being constructed in the discourse and practice of (particularly Western) states the metaphors that are contained in the image and show how they are informing a particular, and flawed, policy response. Roles are not invented in the abstract; they are a response to a perceived world structure the proliferation problem as it would come to be understood the greatest single threat to world security Proliferation thus came to be seen as a wide-ranging problem, encompassing not only the spread of nuclear weapons, but of chemical and biological weapons the response to this new threat would be developed by the West Any solution will include three elements: denying, disarming, and defending to deny high technology to such states. Second, those states that acquire such weapons anyway will have to submit to strict outside control or risk being physically disarmed. A final element must be the development of antiballistic missile and air defense systems to defend against those weapons that do escape Western control or preemption The final element, particularly in the United States, of a security policy to counter proliferation has been the development of military capabilities to defend against what has come to be called the post— proliferation environment.

For one thing, as Bourbeau rightly criticises, securitisation theory ‘treats the sequence of the securitization process in a unidirectional fashion in which audience stands only at the very end’.17 In other words, the audience is a preliminary formed body, whose primary, if not sole role, is limited to hearing, and then approving or rejecting, a securitisation process. Moving beyond the notion of a generic audience, and nuancing between different possible audiences (into ‘popular, elite, technocratic, and scientific’ as Salter proposes, or into ‘sufficient’ or ‘significant’ audiences as Buzan et al. do) is important.18 Nevertheless, it still does not resolve this problem either, as it still presupposes a pre- formed public or space to be identified. The notion of audience is also limited because it grants a rather restricted form of agency to its subjects. What of all those situations in which the subjects of security practices are engaged, not primarily as audiences who watch, listen, and interpret, but as users who act? For example, this would seem to be the case with certain everyday strategies to secure public health. Consider the case of the hand sanitiser dispenser. These modest devices became ubiquitous from 2009 onwards as a response to the swine flu epidemic. As they spread throughout the social space of airports, malls, and other places of mobility, they became ‘palpable signs of a population on zoonotic alert’.19 These little technologies of hygiene certainly engage a population, but not primarily in its capacity as an audience. After all, often the public at stake might not even share a common language or customs. If these soap dispensers play an ongoing function in the governance of public health amongst circulatory populations, it is not through appealing to the latter as audiences, but as user-publics.20 Elbe is right to high- light how pandemic disease increasingly became perceived by national security experts as a security issue from the 1990s onwards.21 However, moving beyond a public policy focus to consider the cultural history of hand sanitisers would surely illuminate key aspects of the capillary nature of this securitisation of health, and in particular how it connects with publics on the scale of their hands, through the sense of touch and via the mechanism of routine gestures. Aside from debates about audience, another way that security studies has tangentially addressed publics is in the guise of public sphere theory. We mentioned Habermas earlier, and his work has proved influential for IR and European integration scholars examining the rise of transnational public spheres. While such work has had a direct bearing on theories of sovereignty, democracy, and citizenship,22 it has yet to connect in a sustained way with the study of security. We should also mention in this regard scholarship that situates security and foreign policy in the political tradition of Republicanism. For example, Tjalve has made a strong case for connecting debates in securitisation theory to the kinds of public sphere theory that developed in the US in the first half of the 20th century, debates associated with such names as Lippmann, Dewey, Arendt and Morgenthau.23 In such debates the public sphere came to be understood as a site of Republican democracy capable of exercising important checking and restraining effects on the conduct of security policy. Public sphere theory has lessons to teach security studies, she suggests, not least the value of cultivating ‘a public sphere with a public language in which [security] acts may be contemplated or opposed’.24 Given that a culture of state secrecy as much as publicity has characterised the climate in which security policy in the post-Cold War era continues to be organised, Tjalve’s plea for a thicker space of political deliberation and opacity is timely. Yet, as we argue below, were we to stake all our political hopes on the cultivation of a more rational- critical public sphere, we would probably be disappointed. It is better, we suggest, to consider some of the other ways in which publics can be figured as zones of political communication, engagement, and understanding.¶ With this point about the limits of the rationalist version of public sphere theory in mind we turn now to discuss recent research on material publics that is emerging beyond security studies. This is investigating ways in which publics – understood as lively, affective and creative assemblies, and as modalities of engaging, mobilising and informing subjects – can bring energy to democratic life, albeit not always in ways that conform to the Habermasian ideal of a rational-deliberative space.¶ Rethinking the Public: Some Lessons from Materialist Approaches¶ We have argued that in critical security studies the question of publics has neither been accorded sufficient theoretical attention nor engaged with enough reflexivity. When publics do come up it is typically as a public sector that forms the backdrop in studies of privatisation (e.g. of military force), as an audience that (mis)interprets security messages, or as a particular realm of deliberation and discussion – for example, the space constituted through parliaments, media, etc. – where policy goals might be assessed and debated. These are valid observations. Yet this seems to us an unnecessarily restricted and thin account of what publics are and how they function in contemporary politics. What might critical security studies gain by rethinking the public? What might a more nuanced account of the nature, character, making and unmaking of publics bring to our understanding of practices, regimes and politics of security? To answer these questions we need to take stock of certain recent theoretical developments in the study of publics.¶ Over the last decade there has been a renewed interest on the part of scholars in a num- ber of disciplinary and interdisciplinary sites – but in particular, geography, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, and science studies – to move beyond the old idea of a public as a transcendental subject or fixed space, and to understand publics as material entities. Borrowing a term from Marres and Lezaun, we refer to this work as material publics.25 Building on queer theory,26 actor-network theory,27 feminist thought,28 Foucauldian genealogies,29 democratic theory,30 and cultural studies of transparency and secrecy,31 material publics research is showing that the public is not a given or a self-evident phenomenon. Instead, it can be understood as the correlate and the effect of a whole range of historically conditioned and socially structured practices, ranging from petitions32 to opinion polls,33 and from the Victorian idea of a library or museum34 to Twitter.35 If genealogy and critical political economy has demonstrated to us that such seemingly self-evident phe- nomena as ‘the economy’,36 ‘the state’37 and ‘the international’38 are not universals but are historically and socially-constituted effects within power relations, then it seems the same should now be said for ‘the public’.¶ It would be a mistake to imagine that a material perspective on publics is particularly recent or entirely unprecedented. We mentioned Habermas’s Structural Transformation at the start of this article. That work was notable for the empirical nuance with which it did situate the birth of the modern bourgeois public, and the idea of publicity in the 17th century within a matrix of class dynamics, economic processes (e.g. the spread of print media), cultural practices (e.g. literary criticism), and urban spaces (e.g. coffee houses and salons). The approaches we highlight in this section share this sensitivity towards material practices. However, a key way they depart from Habermas is that they do not assume his task of locating these practices in an overarching developmental trajectory of modern capitalism and class struggle. Instead, and at the risk of generalising, we could say they are closer to the more situated form of analysis associated with Foucault, and the task of accounting for the emergence of practices in terms of polymorphous power rela- tions and contingent events. ¶ Space precludes the kind of elaboration of material publics research that it deserves. For the purpose of this article it will suffice to highlight three themes, and elaborate their relevance for critical security studies. First, a point about what we might call the transi- tory mode of existence of publics. It is that publics are better understood as convened or assembled than as transcendental actors who are always already there. This point has been underscored by Marres who stresses that ‘issues spark a public into being’.39 Building on the immanent and pragmatist conception of publics first elaborated by Dewey and Lippmann, she insists that research into publics should start with issues. It should begin with events, incidents, and controversies – the kinds of phenomena that are the everyday stuff of political life but which political science and IR often devalue as mere ephemera. It should then consider how publics attend to these issues. As we see it, the value of a focus on issues is that it brings out the aleatory quality of publics: how they come and go, how they gather and disperse. In this view, the public is not ever present. Instead, publics only exist as long as an issue is being attended to. But as we know, there is nothing automatic or guaranteed about attention. Hence the question becomes: by what means and modalities, with what devices and mediators is attention sought, captured, diverted, engineered and/or lost?¶ To illustrate this point, and to highlight its relevance for the study of issues of security, consider the elegant study which anthropologist Joseph Masco offers of a billboard campaign and its role in the making of what he calls a nuclear public sphere.40 Masco examines the case of the Los Alamos Study Group (LASG), a peace activism and nonproliferation organisation operating in New Mexico, and the tactics they used to draw a public’s attention to the issue of the nuclear weapons research complex. LASG rented billboard space along some of the major highways crossing the state. Using eye-catching graphics and slogans like ‘Welcome to New Mexico: America’s Nuclear Weapons Colony’, they sought to repurpose a device normally dedicated to advertising accident lawyers or hamburgers into a political tool for drawing attention to US nuclear policy and its effects on the regional environment. Masco notes that sometimes the billboards would be ripped and vandalised.41 The point is interesting from a material publics point of view. Bringing attention to issues is never effortless but takes hard work and inventiveness. It must also grapple with the fact that material forms of communication are themselves prone to decay or destruction, and thus require a work of upkeep. This captures nicely the idea that publics do not float effortlessly, but depend for their existence on the ongoing work of creating and remaking a material world.¶ This example of the billboard campaign can be used to show how a material publics perspective addresses some of the limitations of the more linguistic, social-constructivist framing that has characterised much work in securitisation theory. Social constructivist and narrowly discursive approaches would probably not reflect on the materiality of the billboard itself. Their attention would focus largely on the images it conveys, and no doubt the framing it offers of nuclear weapons policy. While a material publics approach takes this work of framing and interpreting seriously, it refuses to treat it in isolation from the practical and infrastructural work that might locate, sustain, or constrain that interpretive work in social space. Put simply, someone had to make a calculation that high- ways are an effective place to catch the eye of a moving population (and perhaps more effective than newspaper advertisements); someone had to raise funds to pay for the billboard space; and someone had to repair the billboards, which, like all things, are subject to processes of decay. Flows of funding and volunteered work, desert and high- way geographies, passing cars, catchy slogans and jarring images, metal, glue, paper and electric light – all are brought together to modulate public concern over nuclear weap- onry in New Mexico. In highlighting these connections – fragile connections since they are easily damaged – it is not a question of asserting the pre-eminence of material over ideational or symbolic factors. Rather, the emphasis of the material publics focus that we propose here is that the symbolic and the material are imbricated in one another, and that the circulation of symbols, images, and ideas in the public domain, cannot be assumed but demands precise explanation.¶ The second point that we draw from recent research on material publics is that publics are a matter of things as much as they are a matter of opinions and speech. Publics attend to issues, but the issues typically involve things. Ask a social scientist what publics are made from and she might reply with a list that includes listeners, pundits, values, opinion polls, and perhaps TV. Such a list would suggest a rather impoverished ontology of publics. It leaves out the very heterogeneous domain of things that so often animate the issues that concern a public. And here we don’t just mean the things like billboards or tweets through which communications are relayed. We mean also the things that form the stuff of public controversies, whether it be an oil slick, leaked intelligence papers, or diseased cattle.¶ Consider how issues capture a public’s attention, or how public disputes find a point of focus and dis/agreement. Bruno Latour’s work on Dingpolitik has been particularly important in clarifying how things interact with and shape the making of publics.42 He reminds us that public debate about the appropriate course of, say, foreign policy, is shaped not just by rival political arguments or appeals to interests, but through disputes about things – including, most infamously, the absent things that were Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Of course, the things never speak for themselves. Instead, they require mediators and translators who speak (or claim to speak) for them in public forums. Through the testimony of forensic scientists human remains become lively participants in debates about war crimes;43 through the speech of metallurgists oil pipelines play an active role in environmental and geopolitical disputes.44 In these and myriad other ways, a focus on material publics reveals how things, and not just human actors, have an irreducible role in shaping publics in the security domain.¶ While the implications of a material turn for security studies and IR have by now been debated at considerable length, our sense is that its consequences for understand- ings of politics have not been adequately addressed. Hence the point that material objects like files, maps, and infrastructures, shape relations of power and governance, and that the specific and unpredictable agency of objects can sometimes confound the best laid plans of experts. Indeed, these important arguments are by now firmly estab- lished.45 We argue that a focus on things and publics brings something valuable to the material turn: it offers security studies a better understanding of how things become entangled in political disputes. As such, it offers a path to expand the debate about the material turn from governance and assemblages of power, to more fully encompass questions of politics.46¶ The third and final lesson we draw from recent material approaches to publics and publicity comes from feminist approaches, which bring bodies and affects into the explanatory picture. For our present purposes such work is important not only for the way it unsettles the rationalist assumption that publics are, or should be, configured in terms of disembodied deliberative processes. It is important because they also show public and private distinctions to be not static or fixed, but relational and shaped by social identities. This point can be elaborated by considering feminist scholar Susan Gal’s argu- ment about what she calls ‘fractal thinking’.47¶ To think the relationship of public and private in fractal terms means that ‘whatever the local, historically specific content of the dichotomy, the distinction between public and private can be reproduced repeatedly by projecting it onto narrower contexts or broader ones’.48 To illustrate this more concretely she gives the example of street clean- ing. The street is usually thought of as public space. Yet, the distinction between a store-front swept and cleaned by a proprietor as opposed to the sidewalk and road that are ideally the city’s or public’s responsibility also relies on a public/ private difference, this time projected onto spaces that, when calibrated to a more encompassing context [i.e. “the street”], are all “public.” Thus spaces that are undoubtedly public (in one context) can be turned into private ones by indexical gestures (the sweeping and caretaking) which are recalibrations that bring them into new contrast sets.49¶ Gal’s discussion builds on an insight that feminists have long discussed, namely the fact that who does what directly participates in the spatial quality of what is deemed public or private. This example of street-sweeping might seem far removed from the sombre world of security, but just consider some of its implications. Some bodies doing some things (sometimes involving some objects) create for others a sense of place or out-of-placeness, reflected in feeling shock, disgust, admiration, solidarity, etc. Moving bodies in space are always racialised and gendered, and the implications far exceed identifying differential social markers. This means that each body’s affective registers, and its capacity to affect others in certain ways, varies greatly, thus creating different geographies.50 ‘[R]acial hier- archies continue to exist and thus influence the material ways in which marked bodies shape modern social space, thus assuring the different capacities, rhythms and resistances afforded them’.51 A Muslim man murmuring his prayers while reading the Qur’an and a nun softly praying her rosary while waiting for their connection at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the attacks of 9/11 might elicit quite different affective responses from fellow passengers waiting. So, when empirically studying a phenomenon, can we identify the objects, technologies, emotions, and gestures that might connect bodies and relationships to space in such a way that different understanding and deployments of public and private are enacted and deployed in relation to security? With what political conse- quences? This attention paid to marked bodies and emotions involved in the creation of ‘public’ and ‘private’ spaces allows for a less dichotomous or static understanding of the public and private in relation to security, and decompartmentalises them from their traditional relation, if not confinement, to the idea of public deliberations.¶ A focus on issues and the material work of convening publics and generating attention; attunement to things and the powerful ways they participate in the shaping of public controversies; and a concern with bodies, affects and the uneven and fluctuating geographies of public/private spaces and boundaries – these are three insights we take from new materialist approaches that are rethinking the public. We could have drawn out many other points. Our point is as much exemplary as anything else: to suggest the great poten- tial of a greater dialogue between security studies and material publics.",summarize the following text: ,"securitisation theory  still presupposes a pre- formed public space The notion grants a rather restricted form of agency to its subjects another way that security studies has tangentially addressed publics is in the guise of public sphere theory IR scholars examining the rise of transnational public spheres situates security and foreign policy in the political tradition of Republicanism. the public sphere came to be understood as a site of Republican democracy capable of exercising checking and restraining effects on security policy Yet, as we argue below, were we to stake all our political hopes on the cultivation of a more rational- critical public sphere, we would be disappointed It is better to consider other zones of political communication, engagement, and understanding With this point about the limits of the rationalist version of public sphere theory in mind recent research on material publics understood as lively, affective and creative assemblies, and as modalities of engaging, mobilising and informing subjects can bring energy to democratic life, albeit not always in ways that conform to the Habermasian ideal of a rational-deliberative space.¶ the question of publics has neither been accorded sufficient theoretical attention nor engaged with enough reflexivity.

Public sphere theory has lessons to teach security studies, she suggests, not least the value of cultivating ‘a public sphere with a public language in which [security] acts may be contemplated or opposed’.24 Given that a culture of state secrecy as much as publicity has characterised the climate in which security policy in the post-Cold War era continues to be organised, Tjalve’s plea for a thicker space of political deliberation and opacity is timely. Yet, as we argue below, were we to stake all our political hopes on the cultivation of a more rational- critical public sphere, we would probably be disappointed. It is better, we suggest, to consider some of the other ways in which publics can be figured as zones of political communication, engagement, and understanding.¶ With this point about the limits of the rationalist version of public sphere theory in mind we turn now to discuss recent research on material publics that is emerging beyond security studies. This is investigating ways in which publics – understood as lively, affective and creative assemblies, and as modalities of engaging, mobilising and informing subjects – can bring energy to democratic life, albeit not always in ways that conform to the Habermasian ideal of a rational-deliberative space.¶ Rethinking the Public: Some Lessons from Materialist Approaches¶ We have argued that in critical security studies the question of publics has neither been accorded sufficient theoretical attention nor engaged with enough reflexivity. When publics do come up it is typically as a public sector that forms the backdrop in studies of privatisation (e.g. of military force), as an audience that (mis)interprets security messages, or as a particular realm of deliberation and discussion – for example, the space constituted through parliaments, media, etc. – where policy goals might be assessed and debated. These are valid observations. Yet this seems to us an unnecessarily restricted and thin account of what publics are and how they function in contemporary politics. What might critical security studies gain by rethinking the public? What might a more nuanced account of the nature, character, making and unmaking of publics bring to our understanding of practices, regimes and politics of security? To answer these questions we need to take stock of certain recent theoretical developments in the study of publics.¶ Over the last decade there has been a renewed interest on the part of scholars in a num- ber of disciplinary and interdisciplinary sites – but in particular, geography, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, and science studies – to move beyond the old idea of a public as a transcendental subject or fixed space, and to understand publics as material entities. Borrowing a term from Marres and Lezaun, we refer to this work as material publics.25 Building on queer theory,26 actor-network theory,27 feminist thought,28 Foucauldian genealogies,29 democratic theory,30 and cultural studies of transparency and secrecy,31 material publics research is showing that the public is not a given or a self-evident phenomenon. Instead, it can be understood as the correlate and the effect of a whole range of historically conditioned and socially structured practices, ranging from petitions32 to opinion polls,33 and from the Victorian idea of a library or museum34 to Twitter.35 If genealogy and critical political economy has demonstrated to us that such seemingly self-evident phe- nomena as ‘the economy’,36 ‘the state’37 and ‘the international’38 are not universals but are historically and socially-constituted effects within power relations, then it seems the same should now be said for ‘the public’.¶ It would be a mistake to imagine that a material perspective on publics is particularly recent or entirely unprecedented. We mentioned Habermas’s Structural Transformation at the start of this article. That work was notable for the empirical nuance with which it did situate the birth of the modern bourgeois public, and the idea of publicity in the 17th century within a matrix of class dynamics, economic processes (e.g. the spread of print media), cultural practices (e.g. literary criticism), and urban spaces (e.g. coffee houses and salons). The approaches we highlight in this section share this sensitivity towards material practices. However, a key way they depart from Habermas is that they do not assume his task of locating these practices in an overarching developmental trajectory of modern capitalism and class struggle. Instead, and at the risk of generalising, we could say they are closer to the more situated form of analysis associated with Foucault, and the task of accounting for the emergence of practices in terms of polymorphous power rela- tions and contingent events. ¶ Space precludes the kind of elaboration of material publics research that it deserves. For the purpose of this article it will suffice to highlight three themes, and elaborate their relevance for critical security studies. First, a point about what we might call the transi- tory mode of existence of publics. It is that publics are better understood as convened or assembled than as transcendental actors who are always already there. This point has been underscored by Marres who stresses that ‘issues spark a public into being’.39 Building on the immanent and pragmatist conception of publics first elaborated by Dewey and Lippmann, she insists that research into publics should start with issues. It should begin with events, incidents, and controversies – the kinds of phenomena that are the everyday stuff of political life but which political science and IR often devalue as mere ephemera. It should then consider how publics attend to these issues. As we see it, the value of a focus on issues is that it brings out the aleatory quality of publics: how they come and go, how they gather and disperse. In this view, the public is not ever present. Instead, publics only exist as long as an issue is being attended to. But as we know, there is nothing automatic or guaranteed about attention. Hence the question becomes: by what means and modalities, with what devices and mediators is attention sought, captured, diverted, engineered and/or lost?¶ To illustrate this point, and to highlight its relevance for the study of issues of security, consider the elegant study which anthropologist Joseph Masco offers of a billboard campaign and its role in the making of what he calls a nuclear public sphere.40 Masco examines the case of the Los Alamos Study Group (LASG), a peace activism and nonproliferation organisation operating in New Mexico, and the tactics they used to draw a public’s attention to the issue of the nuclear weapons research complex. LASG rented billboard space along some of the major highways crossing the state. Using eye-catching graphics and slogans like ‘Welcome to New Mexico: America’s Nuclear Weapons Colony’, they sought to repurpose a device normally dedicated to advertising accident lawyers or hamburgers into a political tool for drawing attention to US nuclear policy and its effects on the regional environment. Masco notes that sometimes the billboards would be ripped and vandalised.41 The point is interesting from a material publics point of view. Bringing attention to issues is never effortless but takes hard work and inventiveness. It must also grapple with the fact that material forms of communication are themselves prone to decay or destruction, and thus require a work of upkeep. This captures nicely the idea that publics do not float effortlessly, but depend for their existence on the ongoing work of creating and remaking a material world.¶ This example of the billboard campaign can be used to show how a material publics perspective addresses some of the limitations of the more linguistic, social-constructivist framing that has characterised much work in securitisation theory. Social constructivist and narrowly discursive approaches would probably not reflect on the materiality of the billboard itself. Their attention would focus largely on the images it conveys, and no doubt the framing it offers of nuclear weapons policy. While a material publics approach takes this work of framing and interpreting seriously, it refuses to treat it in isolation from the practical and infrastructural work that might locate, sustain, or constrain that interpretive work in social space. Put simply, someone had to make a calculation that high- ways are an effective place to catch the eye of a moving population (and perhaps more effective than newspaper advertisements); someone had to raise funds to pay for the billboard space; and someone had to repair the billboards, which, like all things, are subject to processes of decay. Flows of funding and volunteered work, desert and high- way geographies, passing cars, catchy slogans and jarring images, metal, glue, paper and electric light – all are brought together to modulate public concern over nuclear weap- onry in New Mexico. In highlighting these connections – fragile connections since they are easily damaged – it is not a question of asserting the pre-eminence of material over ideational or symbolic factors. Rather, the emphasis of the material publics focus that we propose here is that the symbolic and the material are imbricated in one another, and that the circulation of symbols, images, and ideas in the public domain, cannot be assumed but demands precise explanation.¶ The second point that we draw from recent research on material publics is that publics are a matter of things as much as they are a matter of opinions and speech. Publics attend to issues, but the issues typically involve things. Ask a social scientist what publics are made from and she might reply with a list that includes listeners, pundits, values, opinion polls, and perhaps TV. Such a list would suggest a rather impoverished ontology of publics. It leaves out the very heterogeneous domain of things that so often animate the issues that concern a public. And here we don’t just mean the things like billboards or tweets through which communications are relayed. We mean also the things that form the stuff of public controversies, whether it be an oil slick, leaked intelligence papers, or diseased cattle.¶ Consider how issues capture a public’s attention, or how public disputes find a point of focus and dis/agreement. Bruno Latour’s work on Dingpolitik has been particularly important in clarifying how things interact with and shape the making of publics.42 He reminds us that public debate about the appropriate course of, say, foreign policy, is shaped not just by rival political arguments or appeals to interests, but through disputes about things – including, most infamously, the absent things that were Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Of course, the things never speak for themselves. Instead, they require mediators and translators who speak (or claim to speak) for them in public forums. Through the testimony of forensic scientists human remains become lively participants in debates about war crimes;43 through the speech of metallurgists oil pipelines play an active role in environmental and geopolitical disputes.44 In these and myriad other ways, a focus on material publics reveals how things, and not just human actors, have an irreducible role in shaping publics in the security domain.¶ While the implications of a material turn for security studies and IR have by now been debated at considerable length, our sense is that its consequences for understand- ings of politics have not been adequately addressed. Hence the point that material objects like files, maps, and infrastructures, shape relations of power and governance, and that the specific and unpredictable agency of objects can sometimes confound the best laid plans of experts. Indeed, these important arguments are by now firmly estab- lished.45 We argue that a focus on things and publics brings something valuable to the material turn: it offers security studies a better understanding of how things become entangled in political disputes. As such, it offers a path to expand the debate about the material turn from governance and assemblages of power, to more fully encompass questions of politics.46¶ The third and final lesson we draw from recent material approaches to publics and publicity comes from feminist approaches, which bring bodies and affects into the explanatory picture. For our present purposes such work is important not only for the way it unsettles the rationalist assumption that publics are, or should be, configured in terms of disembodied deliberative processes. It is important because they also show public and private distinctions to be not static or fixed, but relational and shaped by social identities. This point can be elaborated by considering feminist scholar Susan Gal’s argu- ment about what she calls ‘fractal thinking’.47¶ To think the relationship of public and private in fractal terms means that ‘whatever the local, historically specific content of the dichotomy, the distinction between public and private can be reproduced repeatedly by projecting it onto narrower contexts or broader ones’.48 To illustrate this more concretely she gives the example of street clean- ing. The street is usually thought of as public space. Yet, the distinction between a store-front swept and cleaned by a proprietor as opposed to the sidewalk and road that are ideally the city’s or public’s responsibility also relies on a public/ private difference, this time projected onto spaces that, when calibrated to a more encompassing context [i.e. “the street”], are all “public.” Thus spaces that are undoubtedly public (in one context) can be turned into private ones by indexical gestures (the sweeping and caretaking) which are recalibrations that bring them into new contrast sets.49¶ Gal’s discussion builds on an insight that feminists have long discussed, namely the fact that who does what directly participates in the spatial quality of what is deemed public or private. This example of street-sweeping might seem far removed from the sombre world of security, but just consider some of its implications. Some bodies doing some things (sometimes involving some objects) create for others a sense of place or out-of-placeness, reflected in feeling shock, disgust, admiration, solidarity, etc. Moving bodies in space are always racialised and gendered, and the implications far exceed identifying differential social markers. This means that each body’s affective registers, and its capacity to affect others in certain ways, varies greatly, thus creating different geographies.50 ‘[R]acial hier- archies continue to exist and thus influence the material ways in which marked bodies shape modern social space, thus assuring the different capacities, rhythms and resistances afforded them’.51 A Muslim man murmuring his prayers while reading the Qur’an and a nun softly praying her rosary while waiting for their connection at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the attacks of 9/11 might elicit quite different affective responses from fellow passengers waiting. So, when empirically studying a phenomenon, can we identify the objects, technologies, emotions, and gestures that might connect bodies and relationships to space in such a way that different understanding and deployments of public and private are enacted and deployed in relation to security? With what political conse- quences? This attention paid to marked bodies and emotions involved in the creation of ‘public’ and ‘private’ spaces allows for a less dichotomous or static understanding of the public and private in relation to security, and decompartmentalises them from their traditional relation, if not confinement, to the idea of public deliberations.¶ A focus on issues and the material work of convening publics and generating attention; attunement to things and the powerful ways they participate in the shaping of public controversies; and a concern with bodies, affects and the uneven and fluctuating geographies of public/private spaces and boundaries – these are three insights we take from new materialist approaches that are rethinking the public. We could have drawn out many other points. Our point is as much exemplary as anything else: to suggest the great poten- tial of a greater dialogue between security studies and material publics.",summarize the following text: ,"securitisation theory  still presupposes a pre- formed public space The notion grants a rather restricted form of agency to its subjects another way that security studies has tangentially addressed publics is in the guise of public sphere theory IR scholars examining the rise of transnational public spheres situates security and foreign policy in the political tradition of Republicanism. the public sphere came to be understood as a site of Republican democracy capable of exercising checking and restraining effects on security policy Yet, as we argue below, were we to stake all our political hopes on the cultivation of a more rational- critical public sphere, we would be disappointed It is better to consider other zones of political communication, engagement, and understanding With this point about the limits of the rationalist version of public sphere theory in mind recent research on material publics understood as lively, affective and creative assemblies, and as modalities of engaging, mobilising and informing subjects can bring energy to democratic life, albeit not always in ways that conform to the Habermasian ideal of a rational-deliberative space.¶ the question of publics has neither been accorded sufficient theoretical attention nor engaged with enough reflexivity.

"(William & Anne-Marie, ‘Bringing Publics into Critical Security Studies: Notes for a Research Strategy,’ Millennium: Journal of International Studies, Vol. 44, No. 1, pp. 45–68)
For one thing, as Bourbeau rightly criticises, securitisation theory ‘treats the sequence of the securitization process in a unidirectional fashion in which audience stands only at the very end’.17 In other words, the audience is a preliminary formed body, whose primary, if not sole role, is limited to hearing, and then approving or rejecting, a securitisation process. Moving beyond the notion of a generic audience, and nuancing between different possible audiences (into ‘popular, elite, technocratic, and scientific’ as Salter proposes, or into ‘sufficient’ or ‘significant’ audiences as Buzan et al. do) is important.18 Nevertheless, it still does not resolve this problem either, as it still presupposes a pre- formed public or space to be identified. The notion of audience is also limited because it grants a rather restricted form of agency to its subjects. What of all those situations in which the subjects of security practices are engaged, not primarily as audiences who watch, listen, and interpret, but as users who act? For example, this would seem to be the case with certain everyday strategies to secure public health. Consider the case of the hand sanitiser dispenser. These modest devices became ubiquitous from 2009 onwards as a response to the swine flu epidemic. As they spread throughout the social space of airports, malls, and other places of mobility, they became ‘palpable signs of a population on zoonotic alert’.19 These little technologies of hygiene certainly engage a population, but not primarily in its capacity as an audience. After all, often the public at stake might not even share a common language or customs. If these soap dispensers play an ongoing function in the governance of public health amongst circulatory populations, it is not through appealing to the latter as audiences, but as user-publics.20 Elbe is right to high- light how pandemic disease increasingly became perceived by national security experts as a security issue from the 1990s onwards.21 However, moving beyond a public policy focus to consider the cultural history of hand sanitisers would surely illuminate key aspects of the capillary nature of this securitisation of health, and in particular how it connects with publics on the scale of their hands, through the sense of touch and via the mechanism of routine gestures. Aside from debates about audience, another way that security studies has tangentially addressed publics is in the guise of public sphere theory. We mentioned Habermas earlier, and his work has proved influential for IR and European integration scholars examining the rise of transnational public spheres. While such work has had a direct bearing on theories of sovereignty, democracy, and citizenship,22 it has yet to connect in a sustained way with the study of security. We should also mention in this regard scholarship that situates security and foreign policy in the political tradition of Republicanism. For example, Tjalve has made a strong case for connecting debates in securitisation theory to the kinds of public sphere theory that developed in the US in the first half of the 20th century, debates associated with such names as Lippmann, Dewey, Arendt and Morgenthau.23 In such debates the public sphere came to be understood as a site of Republican democracy capable of exercising important checking and restraining effects on the conduct of security policy.

Some bodies doing some things (sometimes involving some objects) create for others a sense of place or out-of-placeness, reflected in feeling shock, disgust, admiration, solidarity, etc. Moving bodies in space are always racialised and gendered, and the implications far exceed identifying differential social markers. This means that each body’s affective registers, and its capacity to affect others in certain ways, varies greatly, thus creating different geographies.50 ‘[R]acial hier- archies continue to exist and thus influence the material ways in which marked bodies shape modern social space, thus assuring the different capacities, rhythms and resistances afforded them’.51 A Muslim man murmuring his prayers while reading the Qur’an and a nun softly praying her rosary while waiting for their connection at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the attacks of 9/11 might elicit quite different affective responses from fellow passengers waiting. So, when empirically studying a phenomenon, can we identify the objects, technologies, emotions, and gestures that might connect bodies and relationships to space in such a way that different understanding and deployments of public and private are enacted and deployed in relation to security? With what political conse- quences? This attention paid to marked bodies and emotions involved in the creation of ‘public’ and ‘private’ spaces allows for a less dichotomous or static understanding of the public and private in relation to security, and decompartmentalises them from their traditional relation, if not confinement, to the idea of public deliberations.¶ A focus on issues and the material work of convening publics and generating attention; attunement to things and the powerful ways they participate in the shaping of public controversies; and a concern with bodies, affects and the uneven and fluctuating geographies of public/private spaces and boundaries – these are three insights we take from new materialist approaches that are rethinking the public.

For one thing, as Bourbeau rightly criticises, securitisation theory ‘treats the sequence of the securitization process in a unidirectional fashion in which audience stands only at the very end’.17 In other words, the audience is a preliminary formed body, whose primary, if not sole role, is limited to hearing, and then approving or rejecting, a securitisation process. Moving beyond the notion of a generic audience, and nuancing between different possible audiences (into ‘popular, elite, technocratic, and scientific’ as Salter proposes, or into ‘sufficient’ or ‘significant’ audiences as Buzan et al. do) is important.18 Nevertheless, it still does not resolve this problem either, as it still presupposes a pre- formed public or space to be identified. The notion of audience is also limited because it grants a rather restricted form of agency to its subjects. What of all those situations in which the subjects of security practices are engaged, not primarily as audiences who watch, listen, and interpret, but as users who act? For example, this would seem to be the case with certain everyday strategies to secure public health. Consider the case of the hand sanitiser dispenser. These modest devices became ubiquitous from 2009 onwards as a response to the swine flu epidemic. As they spread throughout the social space of airports, malls, and other places of mobility, they became ‘palpable signs of a population on zoonotic alert’.19 These little technologies of hygiene certainly engage a population, but not primarily in its capacity as an audience. After all, often the public at stake might not even share a common language or customs. If these soap dispensers play an ongoing function in the governance of public health amongst circulatory populations, it is not through appealing to the latter as audiences, but as user-publics.20 Elbe is right to high- light how pandemic disease increasingly became perceived by national security experts as a security issue from the 1990s onwards.21 However, moving beyond a public policy focus to consider the cultural history of hand sanitisers would surely illuminate key aspects of the capillary nature of this securitisation of health, and in particular how it connects with publics on the scale of their hands, through the sense of touch and via the mechanism of routine gestures. Aside from debates about audience, another way that security studies has tangentially addressed publics is in the guise of public sphere theory. We mentioned Habermas earlier, and his work has proved influential for IR and European integration scholars examining the rise of transnational public spheres. While such work has had a direct bearing on theories of sovereignty, democracy, and citizenship,22 it has yet to connect in a sustained way with the study of security. We should also mention in this regard scholarship that situates security and foreign policy in the political tradition of Republicanism. For example, Tjalve has made a strong case for connecting debates in securitisation theory to the kinds of public sphere theory that developed in the US in the first half of the 20th century, debates associated with such names as Lippmann, Dewey, Arendt and Morgenthau.23 In such debates the public sphere came to be understood as a site of Republican democracy capable of exercising important checking and restraining effects on the conduct of security policy. Public sphere theory has lessons to teach security studies, she suggests, not least the value of cultivating ‘a public sphere with a public language in which [security] acts may be contemplated or opposed’.24 Given that a culture of state secrecy as much as publicity has characterised the climate in which security policy in the post-Cold War era continues to be organised, Tjalve’s plea for a thicker space of political deliberation and opacity is timely. Yet, as we argue below, were we to stake all our political hopes on the cultivation of a more rational- critical public sphere, we would probably be disappointed. It is better, we suggest, to consider some of the other ways in which publics can be figured as zones of political communication, engagement, and understanding.¶ With this point about the limits of the rationalist version of public sphere theory in mind we turn now to discuss recent research on material publics that is emerging beyond security studies. This is investigating ways in which publics – understood as lively, affective and creative assemblies, and as modalities of engaging, mobilising and informing subjects – can bring energy to democratic life, albeit not always in ways that conform to the Habermasian ideal of a rational-deliberative space.¶ Rethinking the Public: Some Lessons from Materialist Approaches¶ We have argued that in critical security studies the question of publics has neither been accorded sufficient theoretical attention nor engaged with enough reflexivity. When publics do come up it is typically as a public sector that forms the backdrop in studies of privatisation (e.g. of military force), as an audience that (mis)interprets security messages, or as a particular realm of deliberation and discussion – for example, the space constituted through parliaments, media, etc. – where policy goals might be assessed and debated. These are valid observations. Yet this seems to us an unnecessarily restricted and thin account of what publics are and how they function in contemporary politics. What might critical security studies gain by rethinking the public? What might a more nuanced account of the nature, character, making and unmaking of publics bring to our understanding of practices, regimes and politics of security? To answer these questions we need to take stock of certain recent theoretical developments in the study of publics.¶ Over the last decade there has been a renewed interest on the part of scholars in a num- ber of disciplinary and interdisciplinary sites – but in particular, geography, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, and science studies – to move beyond the old idea of a public as a transcendental subject or fixed space, and to understand publics as material entities. Borrowing a term from Marres and Lezaun, we refer to this work as material publics.25 Building on queer theory,26 actor-network theory,27 feminist thought,28 Foucauldian genealogies,29 democratic theory,30 and cultural studies of transparency and secrecy,31 material publics research is showing that the public is not a given or a self-evident phenomenon. Instead, it can be understood as the correlate and the effect of a whole range of historically conditioned and socially structured practices, ranging from petitions32 to opinion polls,33 and from the Victorian idea of a library or museum34 to Twitter.35 If genealogy and critical political economy has demonstrated to us that such seemingly self-evident phe- nomena as ‘the economy’,36 ‘the state’37 and ‘the international’38 are not universals but are historically and socially-constituted effects within power relations, then it seems the same should now be said for ‘the public’.¶ It would be a mistake to imagine that a material perspective on publics is particularly recent or entirely unprecedented. We mentioned Habermas’s Structural Transformation at the start of this article. That work was notable for the empirical nuance with which it did situate the birth of the modern bourgeois public, and the idea of publicity in the 17th century within a matrix of class dynamics, economic processes (e.g. the spread of print media), cultural practices (e.g. literary criticism), and urban spaces (e.g. coffee houses and salons). The approaches we highlight in this section share this sensitivity towards material practices. However, a key way they depart from Habermas is that they do not assume his task of locating these practices in an overarching developmental trajectory of modern capitalism and class struggle. Instead, and at the risk of generalising, we could say they are closer to the more situated form of analysis associated with Foucault, and the task of accounting for the emergence of practices in terms of polymorphous power rela- tions and contingent events. ¶ Space precludes the kind of elaboration of material publics research that it deserves. For the purpose of this article it will suffice to highlight three themes, and elaborate their relevance for critical security studies. First, a point about what we might call the transi- tory mode of existence of publics. It is that publics are better understood as convened or assembled than as transcendental actors who are always already there. This point has been underscored by Marres who stresses that ‘issues spark a public into being’.39 Building on the immanent and pragmatist conception of publics first elaborated by Dewey and Lippmann, she insists that research into publics should start with issues. It should begin with events, incidents, and controversies – the kinds of phenomena that are the everyday stuff of political life but which political science and IR often devalue as mere ephemera. It should then consider how publics attend to these issues. As we see it, the value of a focus on issues is that it brings out the aleatory quality of publics: how they come and go, how they gather and disperse. In this view, the public is not ever present. Instead, publics only exist as long as an issue is being attended to. But as we know, there is nothing automatic or guaranteed about attention. Hence the question becomes: by what means and modalities, with what devices and mediators is attention sought, captured, diverted, engineered and/or lost?¶ To illustrate this point, and to highlight its relevance for the study of issues of security, consider the elegant study which anthropologist Joseph Masco offers of a billboard campaign and its role in the making of what he calls a nuclear public sphere.40 Masco examines the case of the Los Alamos Study Group (LASG), a peace activism and nonproliferation organisation operating in New Mexico, and the tactics they used to draw a public’s attention to the issue of the nuclear weapons research complex. LASG rented billboard space along some of the major highways crossing the state. Using eye-catching graphics and slogans like ‘Welcome to New Mexico: America’s Nuclear Weapons Colony’, they sought to repurpose a device normally dedicated to advertising accident lawyers or hamburgers into a political tool for drawing attention to US nuclear policy and its effects on the regional environment. Masco notes that sometimes the billboards would be ripped and vandalised.41 The point is interesting from a material publics point of view. Bringing attention to issues is never effortless but takes hard work and inventiveness. It must also grapple with the fact that material forms of communication are themselves prone to decay or destruction, and thus require a work of upkeep. This captures nicely the idea that publics do not float effortlessly, but depend for their existence on the ongoing work of creating and remaking a material world.¶ This example of the billboard campaign can be used to show how a material publics perspective addresses some of the limitations of the more linguistic, social-constructivist framing that has characterised much work in securitisation theory. Social constructivist and narrowly discursive approaches would probably not reflect on the materiality of the billboard itself. Their attention would focus largely on the images it conveys, and no doubt the framing it offers of nuclear weapons policy. While a material publics approach takes this work of framing and interpreting seriously, it refuses to treat it in isolation from the practical and infrastructural work that might locate, sustain, or constrain that interpretive work in social space. Put simply, someone had to make a calculation that high- ways are an effective place to catch the eye of a moving population (and perhaps more effective than newspaper advertisements); someone had to raise funds to pay for the billboard space; and someone had to repair the billboards, which, like all things, are subject to processes of decay. Flows of funding and volunteered work, desert and high- way geographies, passing cars, catchy slogans and jarring images, metal, glue, paper and electric light – all are brought together to modulate public concern over nuclear weap- onry in New Mexico. In highlighting these connections – fragile connections since they are easily damaged – it is not a question of asserting the pre-eminence of material over ideational or symbolic factors. Rather, the emphasis of the material publics focus that we propose here is that the symbolic and the material are imbricated in one another, and that the circulation of symbols, images, and ideas in the public domain, cannot be assumed but demands precise explanation.¶ The second point that we draw from recent research on material publics is that publics are a matter of things as much as they are a matter of opinions and speech. Publics attend to issues, but the issues typically involve things. Ask a social scientist what publics are made from and she might reply with a list that includes listeners, pundits, values, opinion polls, and perhaps TV. Such a list would suggest a rather impoverished ontology of publics. It leaves out the very heterogeneous domain of things that so often animate the issues that concern a public. And here we don’t just mean the things like billboards or tweets through which communications are relayed. We mean also the things that form the stuff of public controversies, whether it be an oil slick, leaked intelligence papers, or diseased cattle.¶ Consider how issues capture a public’s attention, or how public disputes find a point of focus and dis/agreement. Bruno Latour’s work on Dingpolitik has been particularly important in clarifying how things interact with and shape the making of publics.42 He reminds us that public debate about the appropriate course of, say, foreign policy, is shaped not just by rival political arguments or appeals to interests, but through disputes about things – including, most infamously, the absent things that were Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Of course, the things never speak for themselves. Instead, they require mediators and translators who speak (or claim to speak) for them in public forums. Through the testimony of forensic scientists human remains become lively participants in debates about war crimes;43 through the speech of metallurgists oil pipelines play an active role in environmental and geopolitical disputes.44 In these and myriad other ways, a focus on material publics reveals how things, and not just human actors, have an irreducible role in shaping publics in the security domain.¶ While the implications of a material turn for security studies and IR have by now been debated at considerable length, our sense is that its consequences for understand- ings of politics have not been adequately addressed. Hence the point that material objects like files, maps, and infrastructures, shape relations of power and governance, and that the specific and unpredictable agency of objects can sometimes confound the best laid plans of experts. Indeed, these important arguments are by now firmly estab- lished.45 We argue that a focus on things and publics brings something valuable to the material turn: it offers security studies a better understanding of how things become entangled in political disputes. As such, it offers a path to expand the debate about the material turn from governance and assemblages of power, to more fully encompass questions of politics.46¶ The third and final lesson we draw from recent material approaches to publics and publicity comes from feminist approaches, which bring bodies and affects into the explanatory picture. For our present purposes such work is important not only for the way it unsettles the rationalist assumption that publics are, or should be, configured in terms of disembodied deliberative processes. It is important because they also show public and private distinctions to be not static or fixed, but relational and shaped by social identities. This point can be elaborated by considering feminist scholar Susan Gal’s argu- ment about what she calls ‘fractal thinking’.47¶ To think the relationship of public and private in fractal terms means that ‘whatever the local, historically specific content of the dichotomy, the distinction between public and private can be reproduced repeatedly by projecting it onto narrower contexts or broader ones’.48 To illustrate this more concretely she gives the example of street clean- ing. The street is usually thought of as public space. Yet, the distinction between a store-front swept and cleaned by a proprietor as opposed to the sidewalk and road that are ideally the city’s or public’s responsibility also relies on a public/ private difference, this time projected onto spaces that, when calibrated to a more encompassing context [i.e. “the street”], are all “public.” Thus spaces that are undoubtedly public (in one context) can be turned into private ones by indexical gestures (the sweeping and caretaking) which are recalibrations that bring them into new contrast sets.49¶ Gal’s discussion builds on an insight that feminists have long discussed, namely the fact that who does what directly participates in the spatial quality of what is deemed public or private. This example of street-sweeping might seem far removed from the sombre world of security, but just consider some of its implications. Some bodies doing some things (sometimes involving some objects) create for others a sense of place or out-of-placeness, reflected in feeling shock, disgust, admiration, solidarity, etc. Moving bodies in space are always racialised and gendered, and the implications far exceed identifying differential social markers. This means that each body’s affective registers, and its capacity to affect others in certain ways, varies greatly, thus creating different geographies.50 ‘[R]acial hier- archies continue to exist and thus influence the material ways in which marked bodies shape modern social space, thus assuring the different capacities, rhythms and resistances afforded them’.51 A Muslim man murmuring his prayers while reading the Qur’an and a nun softly praying her rosary while waiting for their connection at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the attacks of 9/11 might elicit quite different affective responses from fellow passengers waiting. So, when empirically studying a phenomenon, can we identify the objects, technologies, emotions, and gestures that might connect bodies and relationships to space in such a way that different understanding and deployments of public and private are enacted and deployed in relation to security? With what political conse- quences? This attention paid to marked bodies and emotions involved in the creation of ‘public’ and ‘private’ spaces allows for a less dichotomous or static understanding of the public and private in relation to security, and decompartmentalises them from their traditional relation, if not confinement, to the idea of public deliberations.¶ A focus on issues and the material work of convening publics and generating attention; attunement to things and the powerful ways they participate in the shaping of public controversies; and a concern with bodies, affects and the uneven and fluctuating geographies of public/private spaces and boundaries – these are three insights we take from new materialist approaches that are rethinking the public.

To answer these questions we need to take stock of certain recent theoretical developments in the study of publics.¶ Over the last decade there has been a renewed interest on the part of scholars in a num- ber of disciplinary and interdisciplinary sites – but in particular, geography, sociology, anthropology, cultural studies, and science studies – to move beyond the old idea of a public as a transcendental subject or fixed space, and to understand publics as material entities. Borrowing a term from Marres and Lezaun, we refer to this work as material publics.25 Building on queer theory,26 actor-network theory,27 feminist thought,28 Foucauldian genealogies,29 democratic theory,30 and cultural studies of transparency and secrecy,31 material publics research is showing that the public is not a given or a self-evident phenomenon. Instead, it can be understood as the correlate and the effect of a whole range of historically conditioned and socially structured practices, ranging from petitions32 to opinion polls,33 and from the Victorian idea of a library or museum34 to Twitter.35 If genealogy and critical political economy has demonstrated to us that such seemingly self-evident phe- nomena as ‘the economy’,36 ‘the state’37 and ‘the international’38 are not universals but are historically and socially-constituted effects within power relations, then it seems the same should now be said for ‘the public’.¶ It would be a mistake to imagine that a material perspective on publics is particularly recent or entirely unprecedented. We mentioned Habermas’s Structural Transformation at the start of this article. That work was notable for the empirical nuance with which it did situate the birth of the modern bourgeois public, and the idea of publicity in the 17th century within a matrix of class dynamics, economic processes (e.g. the spread of print media), cultural practices (e.g. literary criticism), and urban spaces (e.g. coffee houses and salons). The approaches we highlight in this section share this sensitivity towards material practices. However, a key way they depart from Habermas is that they do not assume his task of locating these practices in an overarching developmental trajectory of modern capitalism and class struggle. Instead, and at the risk of generalising, we could say they are closer to the more situated form of analysis associated with Foucault, and the task of accounting for the emergence of practices in terms of polymorphous power rela- tions and contingent events. ¶ Space precludes the kind of elaboration of material publics research that it deserves. For the purpose of this article it will suffice to highlight three themes, and elaborate their relevance for critical security studies. First, a point about what we might call the transi- tory mode of existence of publics. It is that publics are better understood as convened or assembled than as transcendental actors who are always already there. This point has been underscored by Marres who stresses that ‘issues spark a public into being’.39 Building on the immanent and pragmatist conception of publics first elaborated by Dewey and Lippmann, she insists that research into publics should start with issues. It should begin with events, incidents, and controversies – the kinds of phenomena that are the everyday stuff of political life but which political science and IR often devalue as mere ephemera. It should then consider how publics attend to these issues. As we see it, the value of a focus on issues is that it brings out the aleatory quality of publics: how they come and go, how they gather and disperse. In this view, the public is not ever present. Instead, publics only exist as long as an issue is being attended to. But as we know, there is nothing automatic or guaranteed about attention. Hence the question becomes: by what means and modalities, with what devices and mediators is attention sought, captured, diverted, engineered and/or lost?¶ To illustrate this point, and to highlight its relevance for the study of issues of security, consider the elegant study which anthropologist Joseph Masco offers of a billboard campaign and its role in the making of what he calls a nuclear public sphere.40 Masco examines the case of the Los Alamos Study Group (LASG), a peace activism and nonproliferation organisation operating in New Mexico, and the tactics they used to draw a public’s attention to the issue of the nuclear weapons research complex. LASG rented billboard space along some of the major highways crossing the state. Using eye-catching graphics and slogans like ‘Welcome to New Mexico: America’s Nuclear Weapons Colony’, they sought to repurpose a device normally dedicated to advertising accident lawyers or hamburgers into a political tool for drawing attention to US nuclear policy and its effects on the regional environment. Masco notes that sometimes the billboards would be ripped and vandalised.41 The point is interesting from a material publics point of view. Bringing attention to issues is never effortless but takes hard work and inventiveness. It must also grapple with the fact that material forms of communication are themselves prone to decay or destruction, and thus require a work of upkeep. This captures nicely the idea that publics do not float effortlessly, but depend for their existence on the ongoing work of creating and remaking a material world.¶ This example of the billboard campaign can be used to show how a material publics perspective addresses some of the limitations of the more linguistic, social-constructivist framing that has characterised much work in securitisation theory. Social constructivist and narrowly discursive approaches would probably not reflect on the materiality of the billboard itself. Their attention would focus largely on the images it conveys, and no doubt the framing it offers of nuclear weapons policy. While a material publics approach takes this work of framing and interpreting seriously, it refuses to treat it in isolation from the practical and infrastructural work that might locate, sustain, or constrain that interpretive work in social space. Put simply, someone had to make a calculation that high- ways are an effective place to catch the eye of a moving population (and perhaps more effective than newspaper advertisements); someone had to raise funds to pay for the billboard space; and someone had to repair the billboards, which, like all things, are subject to processes of decay. Flows of funding and volunteered work, desert and high- way geographies, passing cars, catchy slogans and jarring images, metal, glue, paper and electric light – all are brought together to modulate public concern over nuclear weap- onry in New Mexico. In highlighting these connections – fragile connections since they are easily damaged – it is not a question of asserting the pre-eminence of material over ideational or symbolic factors. Rather, the emphasis of the material publics focus that we propose here is that the symbolic and the material are imbricated in one another, and that the circulation of symbols, images, and ideas in the public domain, cannot be assumed but demands precise explanation.¶ The second point that we draw from recent research on material publics is that publics are a matter of things as much as they are a matter of opinions and speech. Publics attend to issues, but the issues typically involve things. Ask a social scientist what publics are made from and she might reply with a list that includes listeners, pundits, values, opinion polls, and perhaps TV. Such a list would suggest a rather impoverished ontology of publics. It leaves out the very heterogeneous domain of things that so often animate the issues that concern a public. And here we don’t just mean the things like billboards or tweets through which communications are relayed. We mean also the things that form the stuff of public controversies, whether it be an oil slick, leaked intelligence papers, or diseased cattle.¶ Consider how issues capture a public’s attention, or how public disputes find a point of focus and dis/agreement. Bruno Latour’s work on Dingpolitik has been particularly important in clarifying how things interact with and shape the making of publics.42 He reminds us that public debate about the appropriate course of, say, foreign policy, is shaped not just by rival political arguments or appeals to interests, but through disputes about things – including, most infamously, the absent things that were Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction. Of course, the things never speak for themselves. Instead, they require mediators and translators who speak (or claim to speak) for them in public forums. Through the testimony of forensic scientists human remains become lively participants in debates about war crimes;43 through the speech of metallurgists oil pipelines play an active role in environmental and geopolitical disputes.44 In these and myriad other ways, a focus on material publics reveals how things, and not just human actors, have an irreducible role in shaping publics in the security domain.¶ While the implications of a material turn for security studies and IR have by now been debated at considerable length, our sense is that its consequences for understand- ings of politics have not been adequately addressed. Hence the point that material objects like files, maps, and infrastructures, shape relations of power and governance, and that the specific and unpredictable agency of objects can sometimes confound the best laid plans of experts. Indeed, these important arguments are by now firmly estab- lished.45 We argue that a focus on things and publics brings something valuable to the material turn: it offers security studies a better understanding of how things become entangled in political disputes. As such, it offers a path to expand the debate about the material turn from governance and assemblages of power, to more fully encompass questions of politics.46¶ The third and final lesson we draw from recent material approaches to publics and publicity comes from feminist approaches, which bring bodies and affects into the explanatory picture. For our present purposes such work is important not only for the way it unsettles the rationalist assumption that publics are, or should be, configured in terms of disembodied deliberative processes. It is important because they also show public and private distinctions to be not static or fixed, but relational and shaped by social identities. This point can be elaborated by considering feminist scholar Susan Gal’s argu- ment about what she calls ‘fractal thinking’.47¶ To think the relationship of public and private in fractal terms means that ‘whatever the local, historically specific content of the dichotomy, the distinction between public and private can be reproduced repeatedly by projecting it onto narrower contexts or broader ones’.48 To illustrate this more concretely she gives the example of street clean- ing. The street is usually thought of as public space. Yet, the distinction between a store-front swept and cleaned by a proprietor as opposed to the sidewalk and road that are ideally the city’s or public’s responsibility also relies on a public/ private difference, this time projected onto spaces that, when calibrated to a more encompassing context [i.e. “the street”], are all “public.” Thus spaces that are undoubtedly public (in one context) can be turned into private ones by indexical gestures (the sweeping and caretaking) which are recalibrations that bring them into new contrast sets.49¶ Gal’s discussion builds on an insight that feminists have long discussed, namely the fact that who does what directly participates in the spatial quality of what is deemed public or private. This example of street-sweeping might seem far removed from the sombre world of security, but just consider some of its implications. Some bodies doing some things (sometimes involving some objects) create for others a sense of place or out-of-placeness, reflected in feeling shock, disgust, admiration, solidarity, etc. Moving bodies in space are always racialised and gendered, and the implications far exceed identifying differential social markers. This means that each body’s affective registers, and its capacity to affect others in certain ways, varies greatly, thus creating different geographies.50 ‘[R]acial hier- archies continue to exist and thus influence the material ways in which marked bodies shape modern social space, thus assuring the different capacities, rhythms and resistances afforded them’.51 A Muslim man murmuring his prayers while reading the Qur’an and a nun softly praying her rosary while waiting for their connection at Chicago O’Hare International Airport after the attacks of 9/11 might elicit quite different affective responses from fellow passengers waiting. So, when empirically studying a phenomenon, can we identify the objects, technologies, emotions, and gestures that might connect bodies and relationships to space in such a way that different understanding and deployments of public and private are enacted and deployed in relation to security? With what political conse- quences? This attention paid to marked bodies and emotions involved in the creation of ‘public’ and ‘private’ spaces allows for a less dichotomous or static understanding of the public and private in relation to security, and decompartmentalises them from their traditional relation, if not confinement, to the idea of public deliberations.¶ A focus on issues and the material work of convening publics and generating attention; attunement to things and the powerful ways they participate in the shaping of public controversies; and a concern with bodies, affects and the uneven and fluctuating geographies of public/private spaces and boundaries – these are three insights we take from new materialist approaches that are rethinking the public. We could have drawn out many other points. Our point is as much exemplary as anything else: to suggest the great poten- tial of a greater dialogue between security studies and material publics.",summarize the following text: ,"securitisation theory  still presupposes a pre- formed public space The notion grants a rather restricted form of agency to its subjects another way that security studies has tangentially addressed publics is in the guise of public sphere theory IR scholars examining the rise of transnational public spheres situates security and foreign policy in the political tradition of Republicanism. the public sphere came to be understood as a site of Republican democracy capable of exercising checking and restraining effects on security policy Yet, as we argue below, were we to stake all our political hopes on the cultivation of a more rational- critical public sphere, we would be disappointed It is better to consider other zones of political communication, engagement, and understanding With this point about the limits of the rationalist version of public sphere theory in mind recent research on material publics understood as lively, affective and creative assemblies, and as modalities of engaging, mobilising and informing subjects can bring energy to democratic life, albeit not always in ways that conform to the Habermasian ideal of a rational-deliberative space.¶ the question of publics has neither been accorded sufficient theoretical attention nor engaged with enough reflexivity. When publics do come up it is typically as a particular realm of deliberation and discussion – for example, the space constituted through parliaments, media, etc. – where policy goals might be assessed and debated this seems an unnecessarily restricted and thin account of contemporary politics What might a more nuanced account of the character, making and unmaking of publics bring to our understanding of practices, regimes and politics of security? to move beyond the old idea of a public as a transcendental or fixed space, and to understand publics as material entities. the public is not a given or a self-evident phenomenon. Instead, it can be understood as the correlate  of a whole range of historically conditioned and socially structured practices If such seemingly self-evident phe- nomena as ‘the economy’ the state’ and ‘the international’ are not universals but historically and socially-constituted effects within power relations, then it seems the same should now be said for ‘the public’.¶ research into publics should start with the kinds of phenomena that are the everyday stuff of political life but which political science and IR often devalue as mere ephemera the focus brings out the aleatory quality of publics: how they come and go, gather and disperse the public is not ever present publics only exist as long as an issue is But there is nothing automatic or guaranteed about attention Hence the question becomes: by what means and modalities, with what devices and mediators is attention sought, captured, diverted, engineered and/or lost?¶ To illustrate this point, Masco examines a peace activism and nonproliferation organisation and the tactics they used to draw a public’s attention to the issue of the nuclear weapons research complex. billboard graphics and slogans like ‘Welcome to New Mexico: America’s Nuclear Weapons Colony sought to repurpose a device into a political tool for drawing attention to US nuclear policy and its effects on the regional environment Bringing attention to issues takes hard work and inventiveness publics do not float effortlessly, but depend for their existence on the ongoing work of creating and remaking a material world.¶ Social constructivist approaches would not reflect on the materiality of the billboard itself. Their attention would focus on the images and the framing of nuclear weapons policy. While a material publics approach takes this framing and interpreting seriously, it refuses to treat it in isolation from the practical and infrastructural work that might sustain, or constrain that interpretive work in social space it is not a question of asserting the pre-eminence of material over ideational or symbolic factors.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier.

Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility

The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea.

Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase.

A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support this thinking is flawed.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.

But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.

More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation.

The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening.

There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction.

The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views.

Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces might not be a full answer to the dilemma either Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above.

Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces might not be a full answer to the dilemma either Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited
The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific a number of the relevant systems could also be very helpful in a major overland operation More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated As Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis Overconfidence could result
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination
none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario"
"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.

But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier.

A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support this thinking is flawed.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.

But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.

More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation.

The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening.

There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction.

The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then: South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000 North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000 South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies. However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action. In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious. North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces might not be a full answer to the dilemma either Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above.

Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces might not be a full answer to the dilemma either Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited
The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific a number of the relevant systems could also be very helpful in a major overland operation More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated As Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis Overconfidence could result
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination
none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario"
"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion////
of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil. Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies. The Nuclear Dimension Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33 Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional. As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment. On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario. The China Dimension How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity. However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38 Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40 Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government. China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula. A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash. For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45 The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang. But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces these scenarios could lead to a major conflict The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea with an eye toward securing w of m  d These goals would be most realistically achieved by overthrowing the North Korean government There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow These considerations put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces While South Korea has a fine army its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role Thus, an American maneuver capability would help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces might not be a full answer to the dilemma either Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians.

"It is undeniable that some in the socialist and Marxist traditions--primarily in the 19th and early 20th century--assumed that because African Americans were overrepresented as workers, simply focusing on the class struggle would by itself liberate Black workers and the poor from their oppression. But Marxist theory on the ""Black question"" has certainly evolved since then. Marxism should not be conceived of as an unchanging dogma. It is a guide to social revolution and political action, and has been built upon by successive generations of Marxists. But theory doesn't precede material and social conditions--it flows from them. In the mid-1920s, when hundreds of thousands of African Americans made their way to the urban North, socialists and communists were forced to theorize how they would relate to Black workers on a mass scale--something that had never been an issue before. Black revolutionary Claude McKay reported as a delegate to the Communist International in 1922: In associating with the comrades of America, I have found demonstrations of prejudice on the various occasions when the white and black comrades had to get together, and this is the greatest obstacle that the Communists of America have got to overcome--the fact that they first have got to emancipate themselves from the ideas they entertained toward Negroes before they can be able to reach the Negroes with any kind of radical propaganda. The Russian revolutionary Lenin directly intervened in the American Communist Party (CP) and directed it to immediately begin political agitation among African Americans. Thus, the founding convention of the Communist Party in 1919 stated merely that the ""racial oppression of the Negro is simply the expression of his economic bondage and oppression, each intensifying the other."" By 1921, after Lenin's involvement on the question, the stated approach of the CP had shifted, with its program stating: The Negro workers in American are exploited and oppressed more ruthlessly than any other group. The history of the Southern Negro is the history of a reign of terror--of persecution, rape and murder...Because of the anti-Negro policies of organized labor, the Negro has despaired of aid from this source, and he has either been driven into the camp of labor's enemies, or has been compelled to develop purely racial organizations which seek purely racial aims. The Workers Party will support the Negroes in their struggle for Liberation, and will help them in their fight for economic, political and social equality...Its task will be to destroy altogether the barrier of race prejudice that has been used to keep apart the Black and white workers, and bind them into a solid union of revolutionary forces for the overthrow of our common enemy. By the early 1940s, thousands of Blacks had joined the Communist Party. The politics of communism became the dominant political framework for most of the nonwhite world as hundreds of millions of people of color across the globe were inspired by the writings of Lenin on the rights of oppressed nations to fight for their own freedom. Lenin wrote: The proletariat must struggle against the enforced retention of oppressed nations within the bounds of the given state...The proletariat must demand freedom of political separation for the colonies and nations oppressed by ""their own"" nation. Otherwise, the internationalism of the proletariat would be nothing but empty words; neither confidence nor class solidarity would be possible between the workers of the oppressed and the oppressor nations... On the other hand, the socialists of the oppressed nation must, in particular, defend and implement the full and unconditional unity, including organizational unity, of the workers of the oppressed nation and those of the oppressor nation. Without this it is impossible to defend the independent policy of the proletariat and their class solidarity with the proletariat of other countries. So it is an odd charge that Marxism is incapable of comprehending the racialized nature of capitalism, while simultaneously becoming the politics that led the vast majority of non-white national liberation movements in the 20th century. The critique of Marxism also minimizes the extent to which Black revolutionaries and the Black struggle itself shaped and impacted the trajectory of Marxist thought. Thus, C.L.R. James, the Black revolutionary from the Caribbean and collaborator with Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, advanced Marxist theory when he wrote--presciently in 1948, years before the emergence of the civil rights movement in the U.S. South: We say, number one, that the Negro struggle, the independent Negro struggle, has a vitality and a validity of its own; that it has deep historic roots in the past of America and in present struggles; it has an organic political perspective, along which it is traveling, to one degree or another, and everything shows that at the present time it is traveling with great speed and vigor. We say, number two, that this independent Negro movement is able to intervene with terrific force upon the general social and political life of the nation, despite the fact that it is waged under the banner of democratic rights and is not led necessarily either by the organized labor movement or the Marxist party. We say, number three, and this is the most important, that it is able to exercise a powerful influence upon the revolutionary proletariat, that it has got a great contribution to make to the development of the proletariat in the United States, and that it is in itself a constituent part of the struggle for socialism. In this way we challenge directly any attempt to subordinate or to push to the rear the social and political significance of the independent Negro struggle for democratic rights. That is our position. It was the position of Lenin 30 years ago. It was the position of Trotsky which he fought for during many years. It has been concretized by the general class struggle in the United States, and the tremendous struggles of the Negro people. The question of white workers Much of the controversy about Marxism and race is over whether Marxist theory appropriately comprehends the centrality of race in U.S. society and beyond. But what is really at the heart of the debate is the view of revolutionary Marxists that: one, white workers do not have a privileged status in this country; two, white workers can gain revolutionary consciousness; and three, therefore a multiracial and united working-class revolution is possible. Marxists start with the premise that all workers under capitalism are oppressed, but some workers face further oppression because of additional discrimination like racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-immigrant ideas, religious oppression, etc. Thus, in the United States, white workers are oppressed, but not to the same degree as non-white workers. Oppression is not just an ideological tool to divide groups of workers, but has real material consequences as well. Because of racism, for example, the median household income for white families as of 2006 was over $50,000 a year. For Blacks, it was just under $32,000. By every measure of the quality of life in the U.S., whites are on the top and Blacks are on the bottom. Marxists do not deny that these differences exist, nor do we deny that oppression means the lives of some workers are actually worse than others. For Marxists, the question is the cause of the differences. Are the disparities the result of white workers benefiting directly from the oppression of Black workers? That is, do white workers make more on average because Black workers make less? To accept this explanation means to ignore the biggest beneficiary in the disparity in wages--employers and bosses. That employers are able to use racism to justify paying Black workers less brings the wages of all workers down--the employers enjoy the difference. This is not to deny that white workers receive some advantages in U.S. society because they are white in a racist society. If they did not get some advantage--and with it, the illusion that the system works for them--then racism would not be effective in dividing Black and white workers. The distinctions and differences among workers function to create a distorted view of reality that turns the traits attributed to the oppressed into a kind of ""common sense,"" which in turn deepens those divisions. African Americans are poorer, have worse housing, go to worse schools, have a shorter life span and generally live in worse conditions, which helps to perpetuate the image in the minds of white workers that African Americans are inferior. But the problem with so-called ""common sense"" is that it is based on surface appearances and information, and does not reach deeper to give a systemic explanation for the disparities that exist in society. Instead, it creates what Frederick Engels was the first to call ""false consciousness."" False consciousness is simply ruling-class ideology that is used to explain away or cover up material reality. The point is that white workers, to the extent that they accept white supremacy, contribute to capitalism's ability to exploit them more effectively. The purely ""psychological"" advantage obscures the very real material deficit that racist oppression helps reinforce. Du Bois explained how ""false consciousness"" worked in the South and why a labor movement never developed there in the aftermath of slavery: The race element was emphasized in order that property holders could get the support of the majority of white laborers and make it more possible to exploit Negro labor. But the race philosophy came as a new and terrible thing to make labor unity or labor class-consciousness impossible. So long as the Southern white laborers could be induced to prefer poverty to equality with the Negro, just so long was a labor movement in the South made impossible. For Du Bois, racism wasn't metaphysical, nor did it exist autonomously from class. Its development is a result of one class' efforts to keep power away from another. Du Bois did come up with a famous formulation of poor whites gaining a ""psychological wage""--as opposed to a material wage--from racism. But the psychological wage was to make the white worker feel superior because he wasn't Black, even though he would have nothing material to show for it. This leads to the question: If it isn't in the interest of white workers to be racist, then why do they accept racist ideas? But the same question could be asked of any group of workers. Why do men accept sexist ideas? Why do Black workers accept racist anti-immigrant ideas? Why do many Black Caribbean and African immigrant workers think that Black Americans are lazy? Why do American workers of all races accept many racist ideas about Arabs and Muslims? If most people agree that it would be in the interest of any group of workers to be more united than divided, then why do workers accept reactionary ideas? There are two primary reasons. The first is competition. Capitalism operates under the laws of false scarcity, which simply means that we are all told there isn't enough to go around, so we must compete with each other for housing, education, jobs and anything else valued in society. While the scarcity is false, the competition is real, and workers fighting over these items to better themselves or their families are often willing to believe the worst about other workers to justify why they should have something and others should not. The other reason is, as Marx wrote in the German Ideology, that the ruling ideas of any society are the ideas of the ruling class. We live in a racist society, and therefore people hold racist ideas. The more important question is whether or not those ideas can change. The consciousness of workers is both fluid and contradictory because of the clash between the ""ruling ideas"" in society and people's lived experience. So, for example, while the media inundates people with constant images of Blacks as criminals or on welfare, people's experience with Blacks at work completely contradicts the stereotype. The Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci explained the phenomenon of mixed consciousness this way: The active man-in-the-mass has a practical activity but has no clear theoretical consciousness of his practical activity which nonetheless involves understanding the world in so far as it transforms it. His theoretical consciousness can...be historically in opposition to his activity. One might almost say that he has two theoretical consciousnesses (or one contradictory consciousness): one which is implicit in his activity and which in reality unites him with all fellow workers in the practical transformation of the real world; and one superficially explicit or verbal, which he has inherited from the past and uncritically absorbed. The person is strangely composite: it contains Stone Age elements and principles of a more advanced science, prejudices all past phases of history at the local level and intuitions of a future philosophy which will be that of a human race united the world over. Whether or not a group of workers has reactionary, mixed or even revolutionary consciousness does not change their objective and real function as exploited and oppressed labor. The question of consciousness affects whether or not workers are in a position to fundamentally alter that function through collective action. Just because white workers, to take a specific example, may at different times fully accept reactionary ideas about African Americans does not change the objective fact that the majority of the poor in the U.S. are white, the majority of people without health insurance are white and the majority of the homeless are white. While Blacks and Latinos are disproportionately affected by the economic reality of the U.S. today, in a country that is more than 65 percent white, it is a reality they share with the majority of white workers. This shared reality shows the potential for a united struggle to better the conditions of all workers. But by the same token, losing the battle against racism undermines the overall project of working-class revolution. As Du Bois explained in Black Reconstruction about the defeat of the post-Civil War Reconstruction policies that briefly put the power of the federal government behind equal rights for the freed slaves: The political success of the doctrine of racial separation, which overthrew Reconstruction by uniting the planter and the poor white, was far exceeded by its astonishing economic results. The theory of laboring class unity rests upon the assumption that laborers, despite internal jealousies, will unite because of their opposition to exploitation by the capitalists. According to this, even after a part of the poor white laboring class became identified with the planters, and eventually displaced them, their interests would be diametrically opposed to those of the mass of white labor, and of course to those of the black laborers. This would throw white and black labor into one class, and precipitate a united fight for higher wage and better working conditions. Most persons do not realize how far this failed to work in the South, and it failed to work because the theory of race was supplemented by a carefully planned and slowly evolved method, which drove such a wedge between the white and black workers that there probably are not today in the world two groups of workers with practically identical interests who hate and fear each other so deeply and persistently and who are kept so far apart that neither sees anything of common interest. Marxism and Black America today Today, the need for a revolutionary alternative to the failures of capitalism has never been greater. The election of Barack Obama came 40 years after the passage of the 1968 Civil Rights Act, the last piece of civil rights legislation from the civil rights era of the 1960s. Despite the enormous shift in racial attitudes symbolized by the election of a Black president in a country built in large part on the enslavement of Black people, the condition of the vast majority of African Americans today is perilous. For almost two years, Black unemployment has fluctuated between 15 and 17 percent. Almost 20 percent of African Americans under the age of 65 are without health insurance compared to 15 percent for the rest of the population. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, a home owned by an African American or Latino family is 76 percent more likely to be foreclosed upon than a white-owned home. The wipeout of home ownership among African Americans threatens to widen even more the gap in median family net worth. In 2007, the average white family had a net worth of more than $171,000 compared to less than $29,000 for African American and Latino families. More than 25 percent of Blacks and Latinos languish below the official poverty line, and more than a third of Black and Latino children live in poverty. The distressing numbers that document the full impact of racism and discrimination in the United States have no end. But while conditions across Black America threaten to wipe out the economic gains made possible by the civil rights movement, millions of white workers are meeting their Black brothers and sisters on the way down. Tens of millions of white workers are stuck in long-term joblessness, without health insurance and waiting for their homes to be foreclosed upon. Thus, the question of Black, Latino and white unity is not abstract or academic, but must be a concrete discussion about how to collectively go forward. For most of the 20th century, legal racism both North and South created a tension-filled cross-class alliance in the African American community that was focused on freedom and equal treatment. The legislative fruition of that in the form of legal civil rights removed the barriers to advance for a small section of Black America. To be sure, the ""Black middle class"" is tenuous, fragile and, for many, a paycheck or two away from oblivion, but a more stable and ambitious Black elite most definitely exists, and their objectives and aspirations are anathema to the future of the mass of Black people. No serious Marxist organization demands that Black and Latino workers put their struggles on the backburner while some mythical class struggle is waged beforehand. This impossible formulation rests on the ridiculous notion that the working class is white and male, and thus incapable of taking up issues of race, class and gender. In fact, the American working class is female, immigrant, Black and white. Immigrant issues, gender issues and anti-racism are working-class issues and to miss this is to be operating with a completely anachronistic idea of the working class. Genuine Marxist organizations understand that the only way of achieving unity in the working class over time is to fight for unity today and every day. Workers will never unite to fight for state power if they cannot unite to fight for workplace demands today. If white workers are not won to anti-racism today, they will never unite with Black workers for a revolution tomorrow. If Black workers are not won to being against anti-immigrant racism today, they will never unite with Latino workers for a revolution tomorrow. This is why Lenin said that a revolutionary party based on Marxism must be a ""tribune of the oppressed,"" willing to fight against the oppression of any group of people, regardless of the class of those affected. And this is why, despite the anti-Marxist slurs from academics and even some who consider themselves part of the left, the idea that Marxism has been on the outside of the struggle against racism in the U.S. and around the world defies history and the legacy of Black revolutionaries who understood Marxism as a strategy for emancipation and liberation.",summarize the following text: ,"Marxist theory on the ""Black question"" has certainly evolved theory doesn't precede material and social conditions--it flows from them. I have found demonstrations of prejudice on the various occasions when the white and black comrades had to get together, and this is the greatest obstacle that the Communists of America have got to overcome racial oppression of the Negro is simply the expression of his economic bondage and oppression, each intensifying the other The Negro workers in American are exploited and oppressed more ruthlessly than any other group. it is an odd charge that Marxism is incapable of comprehending the racialized nature of capitalism, while simultaneously becoming the politics that led the vast majority of non-white national liberation movements in the 20th century. Much of the controversy about Marxism and race is over whether Marxist theory appropriately comprehends the centrality of race in U.S. society and beyond. But what is really at the heart of the debate is the view of revolutionary Marxists that: one, white workers do not have a privileged status in this country; two, white workers can gain revolutionary consciousness; and three, therefore a multiracial and united working-class revolution is possible. in the United States, white workers are oppressed, but not to the same degree as non-white workers. Oppression is not just an ideological tool to divide groups of workers, but has real material consequences as well. Marxists do not deny that these differences exist For Marxists, the question is the cause of the differences That employers are able to use racism to justify paying Black workers less brings the wages of all workers down This is not to deny that white workers receive some advantages in U.S. society because they are white in a racist society. If they did not get some advantage--and with it, the illusion that the system works for them--then racism would not be effective in dividing Black and white workers. The distinctions and differences among workers function to create a distorted view of reality that turns the traits attributed to the oppressed into a kind of ""common sense, But the problem with so-called ""common sense"" is that it creates  ""false consciousness."" ruling-class ideology that is used to explain away or cover up material reality. The point is that white workers, to the extent that they accept white supremacy, contribute to capitalism's ability to exploit them more effectively Du Bois explained how The race element was emphasized in order that property holders could get the support of the majority of white laborers and make it more possible to exploit Negro labor. racism wasn't metaphysical, nor did it exist autonomously from class. Its development is a result of one class' efforts to keep power away from another. Capitalism operates under the laws of false scarcity, which simply means that we are all told there isn't enough to go around, so we must compete with each other . While the scarcity is false, the competition is real, and workers fighting over these items to better themselves are often willing to believe the worst about other workers the ruling ideas of any society are the ideas of the ruling class. We live in a racist society, and therefore people hold racist ideas. The more important question is whether or not those ideas can change. the need for a revolutionary alternative to the failures of capitalism has never been greater No serious Marxist organization demands that Black and Latino workers put their struggles on the backburner while some mythical class struggle is waged beforehand. , the American working class is female, immigrant, Black and white. Immigrant issues, gender issues and anti-racism are working-class issues and to miss this is to be operating with a completely anachronistic idea Workers will never unite to fight for state power if they cannot unite to fight for workplace demands today. This is why Lenin said that a revolutionary party based on Marxism must be a ""tribune of the oppressed,"" willing to fight against the oppression of any group of people despite the anti-Marxist slurs from academics and even some who consider themselves part of the left, the idea that Marxism has been on the outside of the struggle against racism in the U.S. and around the world defies history and the legacy of Black revolutionaries who understood Marxism as a strategy for emancipation and liberation."
"The ethics of affirmation, with its emphasis on moving across the pain and transforming it into activity, may seem counter-intuitive. In our culture people go to great lengths to ease all pain, but especially the pain of uncertainty about identity, origin, and belonging. Great distress follows from not knowing or not being able to articulate the source of one’s suffering, or from knowing it all too well, all the time. People who have been confronted by the irreparable, the unbearable, the insur-mountable, the traumatic and inhuman event will do anything to find solace, resolution, and also compensation. The yearning for these mea-sures—solace, closure, justice—is all too understandable and worthy of respect. Nowadays, this longing is both supported and commercially ex-ploited by genetics and its application to tracking of racial and territorial origins. The ethical dilemma was already posed by Jean-François Lyotard in Le Differend and, much earlier, by Primo Levi about the survivors of Nazi concentration camps: the kind of vulnerability human beings experience in face of events on the scale of high horror is something for which no adequate compensation is even thinkable, let alone applicable. There is an incommensurability of the suffering involved for which no measure of compensation is possible—a hurt or wound beyond repair. This means that the notion of justice in the sense of a logic of rights and reparation is not applicable in a quantifiable manner. For Lyotard, in keeping with the poststructuralist emphasis on the ethical dimension on the problem, ethics consists in accepting the impossibility of adequate compensation, and living with the open wound. On the contrary, contemporary culture has taken the opposite direction: it has favored, encouraged, and re-warded a public morality based on the twin principles of claims and compensation, as if financial settlements could provide the answer to the injury suffered, the pain endured, and the long-lasting effects of the injustice. Cases that exemplify this trend are the compensation for the Shoah in the sense of restitution of stolen property, artworks, and bank deposits. Similar claims have been made by the descendants of slaves forcefully removed from Africa to North America (Gilroy, 2000), and more recently compensation for damages caused by Soviet communism, no-tably the confiscation of properties across eastern Europe, from Jewish and other former citizens. The ethics of affirmation is about suspending the quest for both claims and compensation, resisting the logic of retribution of rights and taking instead a different road. In order to understand this move it is important to de-psychologize the discussion of affirmation. Affectivity is intrinsically understood as positive: it is the force that aims at fulfilling the subject’s capacity for interaction and freedom. It is Spinoza’s cona-tus, or the notion of potentia as the affirmative aspect of power. It is joyful and pleasureprone, and it is immanent in that it coincides with the terms and modes of its expression. This means concretely that ethical behavior confirms, facilitates, and enhances the subject’s potentia, as the capacity to express his/her freedom. The positivity of this desire to ex-press one’s innermost and constitutive freedom (conatus, potentia, or becoming) is conducive to ethical behavior, however, only if the subject is capable of making it endure, thus allowing it to sustain its own im-petus. Unethical behavior achieves the opposite: it denies, hinders, and diminishes that impetus or is unable to sustain it. Affirmation is therefore not naive optimism or Candide-like unrealism. It is about endurance and transformation. Endurance is self affirmation. It is also an ethical prin-ciple of affirmation of the positivity of the intensive subject—its joyful affirmation as potentia. The subject is a spatiotemporal compound which frames the boundaries of processes of becoming. This works by transforming negative into positive passions through the power of an understanding that is no longer indexed upon a phallogocentric set of standards, but is rather unhinged and therefore affective. This sort of turning of the tide of negativity is the transformative process of achieving freedom of understanding through the awareness of our limits, of our bondage. This results in the freedom to affirm one’s essence as joy, through encounters and minglings with other bodies, entities, beings, and forces. Ethics means faithfulness to this potentia, or the desire to become. Deleuze defines the latter with reference to Bergson’s concept of “duration,” thus proposing the notion of the subject as an entity that lasts, that endures sustainable changes and trans-formation and enacts them around him/herself in a community or collectivity. Affirmative ethics rests on the idea of sustainability as a principle of containment and tolerable development of a subject’s re-sources, understood environmentally, affectively, and cognitively. A sub-ject thus constituted inhabits a time that is the active tense of continuous “becoming.” Endurance has therefore a temporal dimension: it has to do with lasting in time—hence duration and selfperpetuation. But it also has a spatial side to do with the space of the body as an enfleshed field of actualization of passions or forces. It evolves affectivity and joy, as in the capacity for being affected by these forces, to the point of pain or extreme pleasure, which come to the same; it means putting up with hardship and physical pain. The point, however, is that extreme pleasure or extreme pain—which may score the same on a Spinozist scale of ethology of affects—are of course not the same. On the reactive side of the equation, endurance points to the struggle to sustain the pain without being annihilated by it. It also introduces a temporal dimension about duration in time. This is linked to memory: intense pain, a wrong, a betrayal, a wound are hard to forget. The traumatic impact of painful events fixes them in a rigid, eternal present tense out of which it is difficult to emerge. This is the eternal return of that which precisely cannot be endured and returns in the mode of the unwanted, the untimely, the un-assimilated or in-appro-priate/d. They are also, however, paradoxically difficult to remember, insofar as re-membering entails retrieval and repetition of the pain itself. Psychoanalysis, of course, has been here before (Laplanche, 1976). The notion of the return of the repressed is the key to the logic of unconscious remembrance, but it is a secret and somewhat invisible key which condenses space into the spasm of the symptom and time into a short-circuit that mines the very thinkability of the present. Kristeva’s notion of the abject (1980) expresses clearly the temporality involved in psychoanalysis—by stressing the structural function played by the neg-ative, the incomprehensible, the unthinkable, the other of under-standable knowledge. Deleuze calls this alterity “Chaos” and defines it ontologically as the virtual formation of all possible form. Lacan, on the other hand—and Derrida with him, I would argue—defines Chaos epis-temologically as that which precedes form, structure, and language. This makes for two radicallydivergent conceptions of time and negativity. That which is incomprehensible for Lacan, following Hegel, is the virtual for Deleuze, following Spinoza, Bergson, and Leibnitz. This produces a number of significant shifts: from negative to affirmative; from entropic to generative; from incomprehensible, meaning-less, and crazy to virtual waiting to be actualized; from constituting constitutive outsides to a geometry of affects that require mutual syn-chronization; from a melancholy and split to an open-ended web-like subject; from the epistemological to the ontological turn in post-structuralist philosophy. This introduces a temporal dimension into the discussion that leads to the very conditions of possibility of the future, to futurity as such. For an ethics of sustainability, the expression of positive affects is that which makes the subject last or endure. It is like a source of long-term energy at the affective core of subjectivity (Grosz, 2004). Nietzsche has also been here before, of course. The eternal return in Nietzsche is the repetition, yet neither in the compulsive mode of neurosis nor in the negative erasure that marks the traumatic event. It is the eternal return of and as positivity (AnsellPearson, 1999). This kind of ethics addresses the affective structure of pain and suffering but does not locate the ethical instance within it, be it in the mode of compassionate witnessing (Bauman 1993; 1998) or empathic copresence. In a nomadic, Deleuz-ian-Nietzschean perspective, ethics is essentially about transformation of negative into positive passions, that is, about moving beyond the pain. This does not mean denying the pain but rather activating it, working it through. Again, the positivity here is not supposed to indicate a facile optimism or a careless dismissal of human suffering. What is positive in the ethics of affirmation is the belief that negative affects can be transformed. This implies a dynamic view of all affects, even those that freeze us in pain, horror, or mourning. Affirmative nomadic ethics puts the motion back into e-motion and the active back into activism, introducing movement, process, and becoming. This shift makes all the difference to the patterns of repetition of negative emo-tions. What is negative about negative affects is not a value judgment (any more than it is for the positivity of difference), but rather the effect of arrest, blockage, and rigidification that comes as a result of an act of violence, betrayal, a trauma—or which can be self-perpetuated through practices that our culture simultaneously chastises as self-destructive and cultivates as a mode of discipline and punishment: all forms of mild and extreme addictions, differing degrees of abusive practices that mortify and glorify the bodily matter, from binging to bodily modifications. Abu-sive, addictive, or destructive practices do not merely destroy the self but harm the self’s capacity to relate to others, both human and non-human others. Thus they harm the capacity to grow in and through others and become others. Negative passions diminish our capacity to express the high levels of interdependence, the vital reliance on others, which is the key to a non- unitary and dynamic vision of the subject. What is negated by negative passions is the power of life itself, as the dynamic force, vital flows of connections and becomings. This is why they should not be en-couraged, nor should we be rewarded for lingering around them too long. Negative passions are black holes. An ethics of affirmation involves the transformation of negative into positive passions: resentment into affirmation, as Nietzsche put it. The practice of transforming negative into positive passions is the process of reintroducing time, movement, and transformation into a stifling enclo-sure saturated with unprocessed pain. It is a gesture of affirmation of hope in the sense of affirming the possibility of moving beyond the stultifying effects of the pain, the injury, the injustice. This is a gesture of displacement of the hurt, which fully contradicts the twin logic of claims and compensation. This is achieved through a sort of de-personalization of the event, which is the ultimate ethical challenge. The displacement of the ego-indexed negative passions or affects reveals the fundamental senselessness of the hurt, the injustice, or injury one has suffered. “Why me?” is the refrain most commonly heard in situations of extreme dis-tress. This expresses rage as well as anguish at one’s ill fate. The answer is plain: for no reason at all. Examples of this are the banality of evil in large-scale genocides like the Holocaust (Arendt,1963), and the ran-domness of surviving them (think of Primo Levi who could/not endure his own survival). There is something intrinsically senseless about the pain or injustice: lives are lost or saved for all and no reason at all. Why did some go to work in the WTC on 9/11 while others missed the train? Why did Frida Kahlo take that tram which crashed so that she was impaled by a metal rod, and not the next one? For no reason at all. Reason has nothing to do with it. That is precisely the point. Contrary to the traditional morality that follows a rationalist and legalistic model of possible interpretation of the wrongs one suffered to a logic of responsibility, claim, and compensation, affirmative ethics rests on the notion of the random access to the phenomena that cause pain (or pleasure). This is not fatalism, and even less resignation, but rather amor fati. This is a crucial difference: we have to be worthy of what happens to us and rework it within an ethics of relation. Of course, repugnant and unbearable events do happen. Ethics consists, however, in reworking these events in the direction of positive relations. This is not carelessness or lack of compassion, but rather a form of lucidity that acknowledges the impossibility of finding an adequate answer to the question about the source, the origin, the cause of the ill fate, the painful event, the violence suffered. Acknowledging the futility of even trying to answer that question is a starting point. Edouard Glissant (1991) provides a perfect example of this productive ethics in his work on race and racism. An ethical relation cannot be based on resentment or resignation, but rather on the affirmation of positivity. Every event contains within it the potential for being overcome and overtaken; its negative charge can be transposed. The moment of the actualization is also the moment of its neutralization. “Every event is like death, double and impersonal in its double,” argues Deleuze (1990, 152). The free subject, the ethical subject is the one with the ability to grasp the freedom to depersonalize the event and transform its negative charge. The focus thus shifts to asking the adequate questions. Adequateness, both the logic of claim and compensation, lies at the heart of the ethical stance. This requires a double shift: of the pain itself—from the frozen or reactive effect to proactive affirmation—and of the line of questioning—from the quest for the origin or source to a process of elaboration of the kind of questions that express and enhance a subject’s capacity to achieve freedom through the understanding of its limitations. What is an adequate ethical question? One that is capable of sus-taining the subject in his/her quest for more interrelations with others, that is, more Life, motion, change, transformation, and potentia. The ad-equate ethical question provides the subject with a frame for interaction and change, growth and movement. It affirms life as difference-at-work. An ethical question had to be adequate in relation to how much a body can take, which is the notion of sustainability. How much can an em-bodied entity take in the mode of interrelations and connections, that is, how much freedom of action can we endure? That is the question. It assumes, following Nietzsche, that humanity does not stem from free-dom, but rather that freedom is extracted out of the awareness of lim-itations. Ethics is about freedom from the weight of negativity, freedom through the understanding of our bondage. A certain amount of pain, the knowledge about vulnerability and pain, is actually useful. It forces one to think about the actual material conditions of being interconnected and thus being in the world. It frees one from the stupidity of perfect health, and the full-blown sense of existential entitlement that comes with it. Paradoxically, it is those who have already cracked up a bit, those who have suffered pain and injury, who are better placed to take the lead in the process of ethical transformation. Because they are already on the other side of some existential divide, they are anomalous in some way —but in a positive way, for Deleuze (1969, 1988). Their anomaly deter-ritorializes the force of habit and introduces a powerful element of productive difference. They know about endurance, adequate forces, and the importance of Relations. Marxist epistemology and feminist standpoint theory have always acknowledged the privileged knowing position of those in the “margins.” Postcolonial theory displaces the dialectics of center-margin and locates the force of discursive production. Affirmative ethics is on the same wavelength: only those who have been hurt are in a position not to return the violence and hence make a positive difference. In order to do so, however, they have to become-minoritarian, that is, transcend the logic of negativity (claim and compensation) and transform the negative affect into something active and productive. The center being dead and empty of active force, it is on the margins that the processes of be-coming can be initiated. It is also crowded on the margins. he figure of Nelson Mandela—a contemporary secular saint—comes to mind, as does the world-historical phenomenon that is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in post-apartheid South Africa. This is a case of repetition that engenders difference and does not install the eternal return of revenge and negative affects, a massive exercise in trans-formation of negativity into something more livable, more life-enhancing. Christianity has tried to be here before. It has had an important input in the work of Cornell West, bell hooks, and other spiritually-minded acti-vists today, especially in reconstituting a sense of community and mutual responsibility in places devastated by hatred and mutual suspicion. Affirmative nomadic ethics is profoundly secular and it refuses simply to turn the other cheek. It proclaims the need to construct collectively positions of active, positive interconnections and relations that can sustain a web of mutual dependence, an ecology of multiple belongings. It is a case of extracting freedom from the awareness of limits. For the affirmative ethics of sustainability, it is always already a question of life and death. Being on the edge of too-muchness, or of unsus-tainability, surfing on the borders of the intolerable is another way of describing the process of becoming. Becoming marks a qualitative leap in the transformation of subjectivity and of its constitutive affects. It is a trip across different fields of perception, different spatio-temporal co-ordinates. Mostly it transforms negativity into affirmative affects: pain into compassion, loss into a sense of bonding, isolation into care. It is simultaneously a slowing down of the rhythm of daily frenzy and an acceleration of awareness, connection to others, self-knowledge and sen-sorial perception. Ethics includes the acknowledgment of and compassion for pain, as well as the activity of working through it. Any process of change must do some sort of violence to deeply engrained habits and dispositions which got consolidated in time. Overcoming these engrained habits is a nec-essary disruption, without which there is no ethical awakening. Con-sciousnessraising is not free of pain. The utterance: “I can’t take it anymore!” far from being an admission of defeat, marks the threshold and hence the condition of possibility for creative encounters and pro-ductive changes. This is how the ethical dimension appears through the mass of fragments and shreds of discarded habits that are characteristic of our times. The ethical project is not the same as the implementation of ruling standards of morality. It rather concerns the norms and values, the standards and criteria that can be applied to the quest for sus-tainable, that is to say for newly negotiated limits. Limits are to be rethought in terms of an ethics of becoming, through a non-Hegelian notion of “limits” as thresholds, that is to say points of encounter and not of closure, living boundaries and not fixed walls.",summarize the following text: ,"affirmation with its emphasis on moving across pain and transforming it into activity may seem counter-intuitive Great distress follows from not knowing or not being able to articulate the source of one’s suffering, or from knowing it all too well People who have been confronted by the irreparable will do anything to find solace this longing is commercially ex-ploited and its application to tracking of racial origins There is an incommensurability of the suffering involved for which no measure of compensation is possible a wound beyond repair logic of rights and reparation is not applicable ethics consists in accepting the impossibility of adequate compensation and living with the open wound contemporary culture has taken the opposite direction: it has favored morality based on the twin principles of claims and compensation as if financial settlements could provide the answer claims have been made by the descendants of slaves forcefully removed from Africa to North America ethics of affirmation is about suspending the quest for claims and compensation resisting retribution of rights Affirmation is not naive optimism It is about transformation its joyful affirmation as potentia which frames the boundaries of processes of becoming turning of the tide of negativity is the transformative process of achieving freedom through the awareness of our limits of our bondage results in the freedom to affirm one’s essence as joy through encounters with other bodies and forces A sub-ject thus constituted inhabits a time that is the active tense of continuous “becoming.” it also has a spatial side to do with the space of the body as an enfleshed field of actualization of passions it means putting up with hardship and physical pain. traumatic impact of painful events fixes them in a rigid, eternal present tense out of which it is difficult to emerge This is the eternal return of that which cannot be endured This introduces a temporal dimension into the discussion that leads to the very conditions of possibility of the future, to futurity as such expression of positive affects is that which makes the subject last This kind of ethics addresses the affective structure of pain and suffering but does not locate the ethical instance within it ethics is essentially about transformation of negative into positive passions, that is, about moving beyond the pain not mean denying the pain but rather activating it, working it through. negative affects can be transformed nomadic ethics puts the motion back into e-motion and the active back into activism, introducing movement, process, and becoming What is negative about negative affects is the effect of rigidification that comes as a result of an act of violence a trauma which can be self-perpetuated through practices that our culture simultaneously chastises as self-destructive and cultivates as a mode of discipline Abu-sive do not merely destroy the self but harm the self’s capacity to relate to others which is the key to a non- unitary and dynamic vision of the subject ethics of affirmation involves the transformation of resentment into affirmation transforming negative into positive passions is the process of reintroducing time into a stifling enclo-sure saturated with unprocessed pain It is a gesture of affirmation of hope in the sense of affirming the possibility of moving beyond the stultifying effects of the pain the injury This is a gesture of displacement of the hurt, which contradicts the twin logic of claims and compensation reveals the fundamental senselessness of injustice Why me?” is the refrain most commonly heard in situations of extreme dis-tress For no reason at all.

"Abstract∂ Shani and Arad (2014) claimed that tourism scholars tend to endorse the most pessimistic assessments regarding climate change, and that anthropogenic climate change was a “fashionable” and “highly controversial scientific topic”. This brief rejoinder provides the balance that is missing from such climate change denial and skepticism studies on climate change and tourism. Recent research provides substantial evidence that reports on anthropogenic climate change are accurate, and that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, including from the tourism industry, play a significant role in climate change. Some positive net effects may be experienced by some destinations in the short-term, but in the long-term all elements of the tourism system will be impacted. The expansion of tourism emissions at a rate greater than efficiency gains means that it is increasingly urgent that the tourism sector acknowledge, accept and respond to climate change. Debate on tourism-related adaptation and mitigation measures is to be encouraged and welcomed. Climate change denial is not.∂ 1. Introduction∂ Climate change is one of the most contentious areas of public debate of science. However, in scientific terms it is not, what Shani and Arad (2014, p. 82) incorrectly refer to as, “highly controversial”. Anthropogenic climate change is now clearly accepted within the scientific community (Anderegg et al., 2010, Cook et al., 2013, Doran and Zimmerman, 2009 and Oreskes, 2004). As with all areas of scientific knowledge there is systematic interrogation and debate of knowledge claims, results, models, methods, and procedures. However, to dismiss scientific knowledge claims by discrediting climate change science is to deliberately misrepresent both the scientific literature and scientific consensus on the subject. The recent ‘research’ paper in Tourism Management on it being a “time for environmental skepticism” on climate change and tourism ( Shani & Arad, 2014), or to what they refer as “climate change hype” ( Shani & Arad, 2014, p. 83) is such a misrepresentation.∂ Shani and Arad (2014) claim that.∂ •∂ “virtually all” [“tourism scholars and researchers”] “ignore the critical debate on the accurateness and implications of the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW), which in actual fact is far from being conclusive” (p. 82);∂ •∂ “the theory of AGW is, in fact, under intense scientific dispute” (p. 83);∂ •∂ “there are shaky scientific foundations to the hypothesis that CO2 concentration in the earth's atmosphere accounts for significant temperature fluctuations, empirical evidence indicates that the sun activity is a more plausible cause for climate variation” (as well as “natural factors” including “changes in the galactic environment”) (p. 83);∂ •∂ “no definitive evidence exists to verify that climate is driven by the concentration of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere” (p. 83); and∂ •∂ “the theory of AGW is highly controversial among climate scientists” (p. 84).∂ This paper provides a brief response to these statements and to their litany of climate change denial and misrepresentation. Throughout the paper the terms climate change and anthropogenic climate change (ACC) are preferred to AGW given that increases in globally averaged atmospheric and ocean temperatures are one part of the broader changes within the climate system and, hence, global climate change (IPCC, 2013a).∂ 2. The ‘unequivocal’ consensus on anthropogenic climate change∂ There is scientific consensus with respect to the reality of ACC. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2013b, p. 2) concluded, “Warming of the climate system is unequivocal, and since the 1950s, many of the observed changes are unprecedented over decades to millennia. The atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amounts of snow and ice have diminished, sea level has risen, and the concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased”. The conclusions of the IPCC along with many other scientists are that climate change is real and well advanced. It is not just a future possibility. Evidence for climate change is observational as well as predictive ( IPCC, 2013a).∂ The IPCC concludes it is extremely likely (>95% level of certainty) “that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century” (IPCC, 2013b, p. 15). It is also “extremely likely that more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in greenhouse gas concentrations and other anthropogenic forcings together” (IPCC, 2013b, p. 15).∂ The extent of the scientific consensus on ACC in peer-reviewed scientific literature, which is also the source material for the IPCC (e.g. Anderegg et al., 2010 and Doran and Zimmerman, 2009); as well as supporting statements from scientific associations (Science, 2001); is substantial. Cook et al. (2013) examined 11,944 climate abstracts of peer-reviewed articles from 1991 to 2011 matching the topics 'global climate change' or 'global warming'. They found that 66.4% of abstracts expressed no position on ACC/AGW, 32.6% endorsed ACC/AGW, 0.7% rejected ACC/AGW and 0.3% were uncertain about the cause of climate change. Among abstracts expressing a position on ACC/AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing climate change. Cook et al. (2013) also invited authors to rate their own work. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on ACC/AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on ACC/AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus. For both abstract ratings and authors' self-ratings, the percentage of endorsements among papers expressing a position on ACC/AGW marginally increased. The quantum of peer-reviewed papers rejecting the consensus on ACC is extremely small. The existence of a scientific consensus, especially one as overwhelming as exists for human-induced climate change, raises the level of confidence that the overall findings of that consensus are correct (Bedford & Cook, 2013). There is no scientific controversy although there is an ongoing systematic interrogation of knowledge claims. The misrepresentations of the scientific knowledge on climate change by Shani and Arad (2014) provides a basis for the further study of agnotology but not of climate change.∂ According to Shani and Arad “most apocalyptic predictions regarding AGW are based on simulations of the IPCC's computer climate models, which so far have not demonstrated a high level of accuracy” (2014, p. 83). Yet, available evidence suggests that as a result of scientific norms of dispassion, skepticism, rationality, and restraint as well as IPCC reports being a synthesis of research undertaken by thousands of scientists funded from hundreds of different sources the reports are conservative interpretations of climate change that favor less rather than more alarming projections (Brysse, Oreskes, O'Reilly, & Oppenheimer, 2013). The IPCC does not assume that warming is occurring at a “destructive rate” as Shani and Arad (2014, p. 82) claim. The word destructive is not used in the AR5 WGI report on the science of climate change (IPCC, 2013a). Nevertheless, the IPCC (2014a) does emphasise the risks posed by climate change especially with respect to food, water and human security (see also IPCC, 2012). Contrary to Shani and Arad's (2014) claims, the benefits of climate change do not outweigh the costs. Even Tol (2013), whose work Shani and Arad (2014) cites, suggests that climate change is not beneficial anymore in the 21st century. “Most rich and most poor countries benefitted from climate change until 1980, but after that the trend is negative for poor countries and positive for rich countries. In the 21st century, impacts turn negative in most countries, rich and poor. Future climate change is a reason for concern” (Tol, 2013, p. 127).∂ Climate models do not reproduce single events but rather they produce statistical properties describing the climate. They therefore capture trends in the climate system not its internal variability. Climate models reproduce observed large-scale mean surface temperature patterns very well (pattern correlation of ∼0.99) (IPCC, 2013a) and their performance continues to improve. There is “very high confidence” that “models reproduce observed continental-scale surface temperature patterns and trends over many decades, including the more rapid warming since the mid-20th century and the cooling immediately following large volcanic eruptions” (IPCC, 2013b, p. 13). Model accuracy has improved for regional scales, but continues to be lower than for the global scale (IPCC, 2013a). Although global mean surface temperature has not risen as rapidly as before, it has still been increasing (IPCC, 2013a). Nevertheless, it must be stressed, “the average rate of warming at the Earth's surface is only one piece in the climate change puzzle” (Nature Geoscience, 2014, p. 157). Simultaneously, ocean warming, ocean acidification and high rates of warming in high latitudes, among other expressions of climate change, continue to occur (IPCC, 2013a).∂ Shani and Arad (2014, p. 83) claim, “Further studies also confirm that major temperature fluctuations occurred before man-made CO2. If the IPCC's assessments are accurate and natural factors scarcely play any role in today's climate, we would expect a rather flat and uninteresting climate history, which is certainly not the case (Vahrenholt, 2012).” Vahrenholt (2012) is a commentary piece in The Telegraph newspaper by a climate denier, it is not a peer reviewed article. The IPCC does not claim “natural factors scarcely play any role in the climate.” The IPCC (2013a, p. 11) explicitly state, “Natural and anthropogenic substances and processes that alter the Earth's energy budget are drivers of climate change.” The issue is that natural processes alone cannot explain the current changes to climate, including mean atmospheric temperatures. Other claims by Shani and Arad (2014, p. 83) with respect to “shaky scientific foundations to the hypothesis that CO2 concentration in the earth's atmosphere accounts for significant temperature fluctuations”, are supported by references to non-peer-reviewed material from the Heartland Institute and other conservative think tanks, such as the Cato Institute, as well as selective citation of other sources that discuss natural processes that potentially affect climate in specific locations and times. Similar misreadings and selective citation occur with respect to Shani and Arad's claims over historic CO2 concentrations, temperatures, and the so-called current warming ‘pause’ ( Mann, Steinman, & Miller, 2014).∂ 3. Tourism and climate change: research and response∂ According to Shani and Arad, “It seems far too hasty and irresponsible to recommend that the tourism industry take drastic and expensive courses of action that are based on climate forecasting models that have demonstrated very limited success” (2014, p. 83). Recognition of ACC is based on more than just models (IPCC, 2013a). The contribution of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to warming has been at least 50% since 1950 and continues to grow, further pushing surface temperature up. In order to reduce the impacts of climate change emissions will need to be reduced by all sectors including tourism ( IPCC, 2014b).∂ Tourism contributes to climate change through emissions of GHGs of which CO2 is the most recognised. Others include methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (NOx), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), and various short-lived GHGs that are important in the context of aviation and, to a lesser extent, cruise ships (Scott, Hall, & Gössling, 2012). Tourism transport, accommodation, and activities are estimated to have contributed approximately 5% to global anthropogenic emissions of CO2 in 2005 (UNWTO–UNEP–WMO, 2008 and World Economic Forum (WEF), 2009). The majority of tourism-related CO2 emissions are associated with transport, with aviation accounting for 40% of tourism's overall carbon footprint, followed by car transport (32%) and accommodation (21%) (UNWTO–UNEP–WMO, 2008). Cruise ships provide an estimated 19.2 Mt CO2, and account for around 1.5% of global tourism emissions (Eijgelaar, Thaper, & Peeters, 2010). The UNWTO–UNEP–WMO (2008) and WEF (2009) assessments do not include the impact of non-CO2 short-lived GHGs. When radiative forcing (RF) is considered it was estimated that tourism contributed 5.2–12.5% of all anthropogenic forcing in 2005, with a best estimate of approximately 8% (Gössling et al., 2013 and Scott et al., 2010). Tourism related land use change is a further, though unquantified, contribution to climate change.∂ Given that the rate of growth in tourism is increasing at a significantly higher rate than efficiency gains (WEF, 2009), the absolute contribution of tourism to climate change is increasing and, without substantial change, will continue to grow in the foreseeable future (Hall, 2010, Dubois et al., 2011, Gössling, 2013, Gössling et al., 2010, Gössling et al., 2013, Owens et al., 2010, Peeters and Dubois, 2010 and Peeters and Landré, 2012). There are limits to efficiency gains. Given tourism growth forecasts (UNWTO, 2011), measures such as carbon caps and trade schemes, offsetting and behavioral change must be applied if tourism is to meet its emissions targets (Cohen et al., 2014, Dubois et al., 2011, Gössling et al., 2013, Hall, 2014 and Peeters and Dubois, 2010). Such changes do not necessitate a radical reduction in the number of tourist trips, rather a reduction in the emissions per trip, in order to help lower the absolute amount of emissions created by tourism. The close connection between the implementation of climate change mitigation and adaption measures and sustainable tourism strategies will also lessen negative human impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity that constitute the environmental services on which well-being depends (Millennium Assessment, 2005).∂ Climate change also threatens the relative attractiveness and sustainability of tourism destinations and, over time, the tourism system overall. This will occur over various time scales depending on the specific factors e.g. sea level rise, snow loss, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, species loss (Gössling et al., 2012 and Scott et al., 2012). Tourism system wide effects will impact economic well-being and propensities to travel. Although some destinations and generating regions may benefit from climate change in the short-term, the longer-term systemic effects will have significant consequences for tourism everywhere. This is of especial concern for least developed countries that are affected by climate change and emphasise tourism as a development mechanism (IPCC, 2014a and Scott et al., 2012).∂ Many of Shani and Arad's (2014) questions and claims rest on the presumption that ACC, including tourism's contributions to climate change, does not exist. It does. Are they highly contested by the scientific community in scientific terms. No. Is there lack of a “critical approach” (p. 84) or ignorance of “critical debate” (p. 82). No. There is a substantial, and increasing, body of peer-reviewed research on tourism and climate change (e.g. see reviews in Becken and Hay, 2012, Hall, 2008, Kaján and Saarinen, 2013, Scott, 2011, Scott et al., 2012, Scott et al., 2012, Scott and Matthews, 2011 and UNWTO–UNEP–WMO, 2008). Within this body of research there are significant debates and engagements over the framing of ACC as a scientific and societal problem. But, unlike Shani and Arad (2014), there is not a denial that ACC exists.∂ 4. Conclusions: no time for climate change denial∂ The climate change controversy that should be acknowledged is the extent to which a subject of importance is being deliberately misportrayed by vested economic and political interests (Dunlap, 2013, Friel, 2010, Hulme, 2009, Manne, 2012, Oreskes and Conway, 2010 and Mann, 2012). Climate change science recognises that it must improve communication of its work especially where disagreement and uncertainties exist (Anderegg, 2010 and Weichselgartner and Kasperson, 2010). However, improvements in communication can only go so far when competing against extensive campaigns by some organisations, including the role of conservative think tanks with respect to organised environmental skepticism, to discredit climate change science (Gleick et al., 2010, Jacques et al., 2008 and Manne, 2012).∂ There is substantial critical debate over many aspects of climate change, not only over levels of confidence and uncertainty, but also the paradigms and frameworks within which it is understood as a problem to be managed and solved (Hall, 2010, Hall, 2011, Hall, 2013 and Scott, 2011). This has therefore meant substantial contestation over issues of adaptation, mitigation, vulnerability and resilience and the different transition trajectories that should be followed. Such areas are where debate should be focussed especially in light of issues of policy learning and flexibility, climate change governance, the role of the market, consumer behaviour, opportunity costs and development.∂ Shani and Arad (2014) do not contribute to this debate. It is not a research paper. It could, at best, be described as a commentary or viewpoint. We would argue that it should not even have been published. Not because we disagree with it. But because it hides behind a smokescreen of extremely poor science and deliberately misrepresents the status of scientific knowledge and consensus on climate change (see also Nuccitelli, 2014). A liberal interpretation of what can be published is not an excuse to publish anything. Shani and Arad (2014) do not provide adequate standards of evidence for their knowledge claims. Alternative and outlier studies have their place and should be valued for the perspectives they can bring with respect to problem definition and paradigm change. But they must have a suitable standard of evidence whether by direct research results and/or reputable peer-reviewed sources – and a commentary in The Telegraph is not peer-reviewed science. As Oldfield and Steffen (2014, p. 74) observed, “The bottom line is clear. Denying the relevance and validity of Earth System science is a highly risky, and possibly catastrophic, approach for humanity to take towards its future”. Or, as Tol (2008, p. 37) noted, “Denying that there is a problem [of climate change] is just dumb.”∂ What may change perceptions that ACC does not exist or is negligible? In some cases better communication may help, in others a weather event such as a hurricane, flood or heat wave may occur that makes climate change more believable (Greenberg et al., 2014, Hall, 2006, Kaján, 2013, Lejano et al., 2013 and Schmidt et al., 2013), even though from a climate science perspective the occurrence of a single high-magnitude weather event cannot be specifically connected to climate change, although the likelihood of intense weather events may have increased (IPCC, 2013a and Scott et al., 2012). However, no matter what arguments are presented there will always be those who will not accept the evidence if it is incongruent with their belief system (Hoffman, 2011). As Dunlap (2013, p. 693) observed, “there is little doubt that many individuals actively involved in the denial campaign are not skeptical of climate science but are in full denial, and no amount of evidence will convince them of the reality of AGW.” Taking action to achieve limits to climate change is not just an economic and technical challenge, it raises profound questions of ethics, values and risk, including the responsibility we bear towards future generations, those who will be most affected, and other species. How these questions can be answered is a vital debate as is the selection of means to achieve desired ends. Debate therefore is welcomed and encouraged. Denial is not.",summarize the following text: ,"Shani and Arad claim anthropogenic climate change was a highly controversial scientific topic”. This rejoinder provides the balance that is missing from such climate change denial and skepticism studies on climate change Recent research provides substantial evidence that reports on anthropogenic climate change are accurate, and that human-induced greenhouse gas emissions play a significant role in climate change. Climate change is one of the most contentious areas of public debate of science. However, in scientific terms it is not controversial Anthropogenic climate change is now clearly accepted within the scientific community there is debate of claims, results, models, methods, and procedures However, to dismiss scientific knowledge claims by discrediting climate change science is to deliberately misrepresent the scientific literature and scientific consensus on the subject skepticism or climate change hype is a misrepresentation This paper provides a response to these statements and the litany of climate change denial There is scientific consensus with respect to the reality of ACC. IPCC concluded Warming of the climate system is unequivocal and observed changes are unprecedented The atmosphere and ocean have warmed sea level has risen and concentrations of g h g s have increased”. The conclusions along with other scientists are that climate change is real . It is not just a future possibility Evidence for climate change is observational as well as predictive it is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century It is extremely likely more than half of the observed increase in global average surface temperature from 1951 to 2010 was caused by the anthropogenic increase in g h g s and anthropogenic forcings The extent of scientific consensus on ACC in peer-reviewed scientific literature is substantial Cook et al examined 11,944 climate abstracts of peer-reviewed articles They found 97.1% endorsed the consensus position humans are causing climate change. The quantum of peer-reviewed papers rejecting consensus is extremely small The existence of a scientific consensus especially one as overwhelming as exists for human-induced climate change, raises the level of confidence that the overall findings of that consensus are correct mean surface temperature has been increasing ocean warming, ocean acidification and high rates of warming continue to occur natural processes alone cannot explain the current changes to climate, including mean atmospheric temperatures. claims are supported by references to non-peer-reviewed material from the Heartland Institute and other conservative think tanks Shani and Arad do not contribute to debate. It is not a research paper. It could be described as a viewpoint it should have been published. it hides behind a smokescreen of poor science and deliberately misrepresents the status of scientific consensus on climate change outlier studies should be valued But they must have a suitable standard of evidence The bottom line is clear.

"Many knowledgeable observers have offered a variety of recommendations designed to reduce mistrust and enhance cooperation between Washington and Beijing, involving everything from caps on U.S. and Chinese defense spending to mutual, limited concessions or understandings regarding Taiwan and maritime disputes, and clearer, more calibrated bottom-line statements on alliance commitments and core interests.3 While many of these initiatives make eminent sense, they generally fail to address both the underlying problem of clashing assumptions and beliefs about the requirements for continued order and prosperity in Asia and the basic threat perceptions generated by inaccurate historical analogies about China’s past and domestic nationalist views and pressures. Moreover, almost no observers offer recommendations designed to significantly alter the power structure in volatile areas along China’s maritime periphery, such as on the Korean Peninsula and in and around Taiwan, in ways that could significantly defuse those areas as sources of conflict over the long term.
In order to minimize the potential instabilities inherent in a roughly equal balance-of-power environment, specific actions must be taken to reduce the volatility of the most likely sources of future U.S.-China crises and the propensity to test each side’s resolve, and to enhance the opportunities for meaningful cooperation over the long term. In particular, Washington and Beijing will need to reach reliable understandings regarding the future long-term status of the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, the management of maritime territorial disputes, and the scope and function of U.S. (and other foreign) military activities within the first island chain—or at the very least within both China’s and Japan’s exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Such understandings should almost certainly involve some credible form of neutralization of these areas as locations from which to project U.S. or Chinese power, or the creation of a stable U.S.-China balance of power within them, thereby creating a de facto buffer zone along China’s maritime periphery.
In the case of Korea, this implies the emergence of a unified, nonaligned (or loosely aligned) peninsula free from foreign military forces. This would require prior credible security assurances by both the United States and China that a unified Korea would remain free from coercion and always open to close economic and political relations with both countries. Such assurances might involve a continuation in some form of a greatly reduced security relationship with Washington, at least in the short to medium term. This process might also require Japan to provide security assurances to a unified Korea, at least to the extent of agreeing to not acquire nuclear weapons or some types of conventional weapons that Korea might find threatening, such as precision ballistic and cruise missile strike capabilities. Of course, none of this could happen as long as the Korean Peninsula remains divided, with South Korea under threat of attack from North Korea. Thus, ideally, the development of a stable balance of power in the Western Pacific will require Korean unification sooner rather than later. Failing that, a clear, credible understanding must be reached as soon as possible among the powers concerned regarding the eventual disposition of the Korea problem.
In the case of Taiwan, any credible neutralization of the cross-strait issue as a threat to either side’s interests would require, as a first step, a U.S.-China understanding regarding restrictions on U.S. arms sales in return for certain types of verifiable limits on Chinese military production and deployments relevant to the island, such as ballistic missiles and strike aircraft. Beijing would also likely need to provide credible assurances that it would not use force against Taiwan in any conceivable contingency short of an outright Taiwanese declaration of de jure independence or the U.S. placement of forces on the island. In the past, Beijing has resisted providing assurances regarding any non-use of force toward the island, viewing such an assurance as a limit on Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan. However, as in the case of Korea, Beijing would likely view such a conditional limitation on its right to employ force as acceptable if viewed as a requirement for the creation of an overall stable balance of power in the Western Pacific; Chinese leaders might also regard it as a step toward the eventual unification of the island with the mainland. In addition, Beijing would also likely need to accept: a) explicitly that such unification could only occur on the basis of a peaceful process involving the willing consent of the people of Taiwan, and b) tacitly that eventual unification would likely not occur, if at all, for many decades. For its part, the United States would likely need to provide assurances to China that it would neither place forces on the island nor provide any new level of defense assistance to Taipei, as long as Beijing abides by its own assurances. And both countries would need to consult closely with Taiwan and Japan at each step of this process and provide clear and credible assurances regarding the understanding reached between them.
Regarding territorial disputes in the East China Sea and South China Sea, the United States needs to make clear that it has little if any direct interest in the interactions occurring between the disputants, beyond clear security threats leveled against the two U.S. allies involved: Japan and the Philippines. While supporting, in an even-handed manner, a binding code of conduct and established legal procedures for resolving clashes and arbitrating claims, Washington should avoid staking its credibility on ensuring that a noncoercive process is followed in every instance. That said, it should also make clear that it will oppose, forcefully if necessary, any attempt to establish an exclusion zone or de facto territorial waters beyond accepted 12-nautical-mile limits. For its part, Beijing must clearly affirm, through its words and actions, that there is no military solution to these disputes and that it will never seek to dislodge rivals forcefully from occupied areas. It must also credibly and convincingly state, privately if not publicly, that those waters in the South China Sea located within its so-called nine-dashed line and outside the territorial waters and EEZs of specified land features constitute open ocean. Although doubtless difficult to achieve, such understandings will likely become more possible in the larger context of a neutralized first island chain as U.S.-China suspicions abate.
In the larger conventional military realm, U.S. military primacy within at least the first island chain will need to be replaced by a genuinely balanced force posture and accompanying military doctrine. This should likely be centered on what is termed a “mutual denial” operational concept in which both China and the United States along with its allies possess sufficient levels of anti-access and area denial (A2/AD)–type air, naval, missile, and space capabilities to make the risks and dangers of attempting to achieve a sustained advantage through military means over potentially volatile areas or zones clearly prohibitive. In such an environment, neither side would have the clear capacity to prevail in a conflict, but both sides would possess adequate defensive capacities to deter or severely complicate an attack, for example, on Taiwan, on the Chinese mainland, and against U.S./allied territory, or any effort to close or control key strategic lines of communication (SLOCs) in the Asia-Pacific. This will likely require agreed-upon restraints on the production and/or deployment of certain types of weapon systems operating in the Western Pacific, such as deep-strike stealth aircraft, ballistic and cruise missiles, and deployed surface and subsurface warships.
On the nuclear level, a stable balance-of-power environment in the Western Pacific requires a clear set of mutual assurances designed to strengthen the deterrence capacity of each side’s nuclear arsenal and thereby reduce significantly the dangers of escalation from a conventional crisis or conflict into a nuclear confrontation. To attain this goal, American and allied defense analysts need to discard the dangerous notion that U.S. primacy must extend to the nuclear realm, via the establishment of a clear ability to neutralize China’s nuclear arsenal. Instead, Washington should authoritatively indicate that it accepts and will not threaten China’s retaliatory nuclear strike capability. In other words, it must unambiguously affirm the validity of a U.S.-China nuclear balance based on a concept of mutual deterrence, something it has never done. Moreover, to make this credible, Washington must abandon consideration of a long-range, precision global strike system, or any other new type of system capable of destroying China’s nuclear arsenal through both nuclear and conventional means, and provide greater assurances that its ballistic missile defense capabilities cannot eliminate a Chinese second strike. For its part, Beijing must be willing to accept such U.S. assurances and eschew any attempt to transition beyond its existing modest minimal deterrent, second-strike nuclear capability to a much larger force.
Obviously, these sorts of changes will present major implications for U.S. allies and friends in the region. Japan in particular would play a major role in any effort to create a stable U.S.-China balance of power in the Western Pacific. In order for Tokyo to provide Seoul with the kind of assurances identified above, and to accept the above adjustments in the U.S. force posture and stance toward Taiwan, certain clear understandings with Washington and Beijing would be necessary. In general, the creation of a de facto buffer zone or a neutral/balanced area within the first island chain would almost certainly require that Japan significantly strengthen its defense capabilities, either autonomously or, more preferably from the U.S. perspective, within the context of a more robust yet still limited U.S.-Japan security alliance. In the latter case, Tokyo would become a critical partner in the creation of the sort of defensive, mutual denial operational concept. This would entail the creation of a more fully integrated U.S.-Japan C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) infrastructure, stronger passive defenses against possible Chinese ballistic and cruise missile threats to U.S. and Japanese military assets, and enhanced Japanese logistics and support facilities, alongside improvements in specific defensive-oriented Japanese military capabilities, such as ASW (antisubmarine warfare) and interceptor aircraft. However, this would not require Japan to become a fully normalized security partner alongside the United States, undertaking alliance-based security activities across the Western Pacific and beyond.
For China, acceptance of a strengthened but still limited U.S.-Japan alliance, a unified, largely nonaligned Korean Peninsula, verifiable limits on Chinese capabilities vis-à-vis Taiwan, and the other elements of the stable balance-of-power structure mentioned above would require a clear willingness to forgo those more ambitious security objectives toward which some Chinese might aspire, either now or in the future. These include, most notably, the clear ability to establish control over the waters and airspace along China’s maritime periphery and a Sino-centric Asian economic and political order that largely excludes the United States. This will likely require, in turn, that Beijing make concerted, public efforts to reject and invalidate among the Chinese citizenry those more extreme interpretations of Chinese nationalism that call for China to dominate Asia and to employ aggressive or violent means to resolve various sovereignty and other disputes with its neighbors. Although not mainstream at present, such notions nonetheless could become more popular and influential as China’s power grows (and if Washington responds to such growth by seeking to sustain its past predominance), and would in turn represent a clear threat to regional stability. The benefits for China of these accommodations would be an enhanced level of security via a reduced U.S. threat to vital Chinese interests and the avoidance of a costly and likely increasingly dangerous security competition. These new circumstances would also allow China to concentrate even more than at present on establishing a stable and prosperous domestic environment.
Obstacles to Establishing a Stable Balance in Asia
Several obstacles stand in the way of Washington and Beijing undertaking such a substantial change in perceptions and practices, force deployments, and power relations in the Western Pacific.
On the U.S. side, first and foremost is the general refusal of most if not all U.S. decisionmakers and officials to contemplate an alternative to U.S. military predominance in this vital region. Such maritime predominance has arguably served Washington and most of the region well for many decades, and it accords with the deep-seated notion of American exceptionalism, which prescribes a dominant U.S. leadership role throughout the world. In addition, the short-term perspective, natural inertia, and risk avoidance of bureaucrats and policy communities in Washington (and elsewhere) militate against major shifts in policy and approach, especially in the absence of an urgent and palpable need for change. Indeed, it is extremely difficult for any major power, much less a superpower, to begin a fundamental strategic shift in anticipation of diminished relative capabilities before that diminishment fully reveals itself.
In the Western Pacific in particular, with regard to both U.S. ISR activities along the Chinese coast and the larger U.S. military presence within the first island chain, the United States Navy and many U.S. decisionmakers are wedded to the notion that American power (and in particular naval power) must brook no limitation in areas beyond a nation’s 12-nautical-mile territorial waters and airspace. This derives in part from the belief that any constraints on U.S. naval operations will lead to a cascade of coastal states challenging the principle of U.S. maritime freedom of action and to possible reductions in the level of resources and the scope of operations available to support U.S. naval power. Moreover, the specific U.S. desire to maintain a strong naval presence along China’s maritime periphery reflects a perceived need to acquire more accurate intelligence regarding Beijing’s growing offshore air and naval capabilities. Such a presence is also viewed as essential to sustaining U.S. credibility with Asian allies such as Japan and the Philippines, and to the maintenance of deterrent capabilities against a possible Chinese attack on Taiwan. This combination of service interests, intelligence needs, and perceived security requirements reinforces the general U.S. bias in favor of continued maritime predominance. However, an inevitable Chinese refusal to accept that predominance over the long term will be expressed first and foremost in opposition to the past level of U.S. naval activities along the Chinese coastline, that is, within China’s EEZ at the very least, and possibly within the entire first island chain.
Second, and closely related to the prior point, U.S. decisionmakers are extremely loath to contemplate significant adjustments in the current status of the Korean Peninsula and Taiwan. From the U.S. perspective, any movement toward a reduction in or even a significant modification of the U.S. security commitment to these two actors (a U.S military ally and a de facto U.S. protectorate, respectively) could result in either moving to acquire nuclear arms, and/or threats or attacks from North Korea or China. In addition, Japan might react to such movement by questioning Washington’s basic security commitment to Tokyo, which could result in a break in the U.S.-Japan alliance and/or Japanese acquisition of nuclear arms. These concerns are real, if no doubt exaggerated by some in Tokyo or Taipei in order to justify maintenance of the existing U.S. relationship, and in some cases to avoid undertaking costly defense improvements of their own.
On the Chinese side, perhaps the most significant obstacle to undertaking a transition toward a stable balance of power in Asia derives from the insecurities and weaknesses of the Chinese government, both domestically and abroad. China’s leaders rely, for their legitimacy and support, not only on continued economic success and rising living standards, but also on a form of nationalism that prizes the ability of the regime to correct past injustices meted out by “imperialist” powers during China’s so-called “century of humiliation” and to stand up to current slights, both real and imagined. Thus, their policies often capitalize on the resentments felt by many Chinese citizens toward the supposedly arrogant West and Japan.
This viewpoint makes the Chinese leadership hesitant to quell the more extreme forms of nationalism described above and deeply suspicious of the United States and its allies. It also makes it more receptive to the notion that a rising yet still underdeveloped and relatively weak China must continue to conceal its military capabilities while developing its overall capacities to the maximum extent possible. In other words, the Chinese regime is both excessively vulnerable to ultranationalist pressures and disinclined to contemplate self-imposed limitations on its sovereign rights (for example, with regard to Taiwan) and its political, economic, and military abilities, especially in Asia. While this does not translate into a drive for predominance, it does make Beijing less willing to accept the kind of mutual restraints necessary to achieve a stable balance of power in the Western Pacific.
No Grand Bargain, but a Clear Understanding and a Staged Process Are Required
These obstacles clearly indicate that Washington and Beijing are not about to undertake, much less reach, a formal grand-bargain-type of agreement to establish a new regional security environment anytime soon.4 Such a fundamental shift in policies and approaches can only occur gradually, in stages, and over an extended period of time. But it can only begin if elites in Washington, Beijing, and other Asian capitals seriously examine the enduring trends under way in Asia and accept the reality of the changing power distribution and the need for more than just marginal adjustments and assurances. Only then will they undertake a systematic examination of the requirements of a stable balance of power over the long term, involving a serious consideration of the more fundamental actions. Such an examination and acceptance must initially occur domestically, then among allies and protectorates, and finally via a bilateral U.S.-China strategic dialogue aimed at developing understandings about the process and actions required. Such understandings must provide for ample opportunities and means for both sides to assess and evaluate the credibility and veracity of the actions of the other side.

"The old politics of waiting is therefore gradually replaced by a new politics of impatience and, if necessary, of disruption. Brashness, disruption and a new anti-decorum ethos are meant to bring down the pretence of normality and the logics of normalization in this most “abnormal” society.  Steve Biko, Frantz Fanon and a plethora of black feminist, queer, postcolonial, decolonial and critical race theorists are being reloaded in the service of a new form of militancy less accommodationist and more trenchant both in form and content.
The age of impatience is an age when a lot is said – all sorts of things we had hardly heard about during the last twenty years; some ugly, outrageous, toxic things, including calls for murder, atrocious things that speak to everything except to the project of freedom, in this age of fantasy and hysteria, when the gap between psychic realities and actual material realities has never been so wide, and the digital world only serves as an amplifier of every single moment, event and accident.
The age of urgency is also an age when new wounded bodies erupt and undertake to actually occupy spaces they used to simply haunt. They are now piling up, swearing and cursing, speaking with excrements, asking to be heard.
They speak in allegories and analogies – the “colony”, the “plantation”, the “house Negro”, the “field Negro”, blurring all boundaries, embracing confusion, mixing times and spaces, at the risk of anachronism.
They are claiming all kinds of rights – the right to violence; the right to disrupt and jam that which is parading as normal; the right to insult, intimidate and bully those who do not agree with them; the right to be angry, enraged; the right to go to war in the hope of recovering what was lost through conquest; the right to hate, to wreak vengeance, to smash something, it doesn’t matter what, as long as it looks “white”.
All these new “rights” are supposed to achieve one thing we are told the 1994 “peaceful settlement” did not achieve – decolonization and retributive justice, the only way to restore a  modicum of dignity to victims of the injuries of yesterday and today.
Demythologizing whiteness
And yet, some hard questions must be asked.
Why are we invested in turning whiteness, pain and suffering into such erotogenic objects?
Could it be that the concentration of our libido on whiteness, pain and suffering is after all typical of the narcissistic investments so privileged by this neoliberal age?
To frame the issues in these terms does not mean embracing a position of moral relativism. How could it be? After all, in relation to our history, too many lives were destroyed in the name of whiteness. Furthermore, the structural repetition of past sufferings in the present is beyond any reasonable doubt.  Whiteness as a necrophiliac power structure and a primary shaper of a global system of unequal redistribution of life chances will not die a natural death.
But to properly engineer its death – and thus the end of the nightmare it has been for a large portion of the humanity – we urgently need to demythologize it.
If we fail to properly demythologize whiteness, whiteness – as the machine in which a huge portion of the humanity has become entangled in spite of itself – will end up claiming us.
As a result of whiteness having claimed us; as a result of having let ourselves be possessed by it in the manner of an evil spirit, we will inflict upon ourselves injuries of which whiteness, at its most ferocious, would scarcely have been capable.
Indeed for whiteness to properly operate as the destructive force it is in the material sphere, it needs to capture its victim’s imagination and turn it into a poison well of hatred.
For victims of white racism to hold on to the things that truly matter, they must incessantly fight against the kind of hatred which never fails to destroy, in the first instance, the man or woman who hates while leaving the structure of whiteness itself intact.
As a poisonous fiction that passes for a fact, whiteness seeks to institutionalize itself as an event by any means necessary. This it does by colonizing the entire realms of desire and of the imagination.
To demythologize whiteness, it will not be enough to force “bad whites” into silence or into confessing guilt and/or complicity. This is too cheap.
To puncture and deflate the fictions of whiteness will require an entirely different regime of desire, new approaches in the constitution of material, aesthetic and symbolic capital, another discourse on value, on what matters and why.

The Spatial Politics of Extreme Violence,” in Violent Geographies, ed. Derek Gregory and Allan Pred, 2007, Routledge: New York, NY, p. 285-7]
Then, a body of political thinking is beginning to emerge that has begun to address these problems based around a nascent politics of time and space. In this final section, I want to mobilize this fragile, but still I think viable, “politics of hope” that is both theory and method. In mobilizing this politics of hope, I will attempt to steer clear of the blandishments of an agonized liberalism that would reduce politics to an ethos of multiplying procedures for being nice to one another whilst also trying to avoid the kind of hope that is often generated by right-wing elements, which often relies on moving back to a supposed, but largely mythical, past in which all problems had been solved by virtue. Why is a politics of hope so crucial to questioning violence? Because violence is so often caught up with hopelessness in its many forms, with a bringing forth of a particular appearance of the world in which the future itself becomes a casualty because any sense of anticipation is deadened; “violence changes the very sense of a meaningful outcome to life’s plans” (Nordstrom 2004, 98). Violence is about the death of hope. People don’t fight or flee war because of the sheer fact of violence. They fight or flee war because of what violence “feels” like. And how does violence feel? …it feels like existential crisis, like hopelessness, like loss of the future. It feels like impossible contradictions of resistance within oppression, like the struggle of humanity within terror. Violence is about impossibility, about the human condition and the meaning of survival. This is why wars are fought with bloodletting, why torture takes place, and why neither violence nor war is limited to the physical carnage of the battlefield. (Nordstrom 2004, 58) A politics of hope involves a double commitment to changing the world. One commitment is temporal. Only thinking directed towards changing the world and informing the desire to change it does not confront the future (the unclosed space for new development in front of us) as embarrassment and the past as spell. (Bloch, 1986, 8) But, at the same time this temporal commitment is no simple utopian-radical millenarianism. Rather, it is a politics of surprise aiming at multiplying moments of hope by pulling the future into the present.27 It is, in other words, still utopian-radical in its sympathies, but substitutes the question of temporality for the question of agency in the belief that it is vital to break from the limitations of “historical” time.28 So, both Bloch and Benjamin draw attention to the character of a hopeful moment. For both, hope is always disappointed. Yet, in Benjamin’s view, hope in the present points to its own future moment of salvation. Likewise, Bloch draws attention to unfulfilled hope as ‘the repressed, the interrupted, the undischarged on which one can in one and the same act fall back upon while it reaches forward to us in order to develop in a better way’ and points to how in this unfulfilled hope, the “corresponding points of the now sparkle and transmit each other” (1998, 29). Both seek to apprehend a moment of hope, in other words, by striking it with a perspective whose direction is opposite to that of the moment. In other words, to borrow Benjamin’s expression, the spark of hope flies up in the midst of the radical temporal re-orientation in their own analyses. (Miyazaki 2004, 23)  The other commitment is spatial. For hope is unequally distributed. There are zones of the world in which the circumstances are so unbearable that belief starts to fade that these circumstances will ever come to an end. In part, suicide bombing can be seen as a reaction to the geography of these unbearable spaces, of these spaces of pain. Thus on one side, suicide bombing can be seen as the result of the current proliferation of necropolitical spaces. It is a cliché of modern geopolitical writing that the number of wild spaces outside state control has been proliferating, in part because of the vagaries of late modern colonial occupations of various kinds which tend to be uncertain and fragmentary affairs which, as a result, seem to promote such an extreme militarization of daily life that they produce an accelerated and constant state of violence (Mbembe 2003). On the other side, suicide bombing can be seen as resulting from the wider and wider definition of what counts as a battlefield. In the past, a key illusion of Western audiences has been that wars take place in defined spaces and involve defined combatants: soldiers shooting (mainly) at other soldiers. War does not spill outside these spaces: in other words, war and peace have their own spaces and they do not infect each other. But through the twentieth and into the twenty-first century, the question “where is war”? has become increasingly difficult to answer. Martial violence cannot be parochialized: it takes in many people in many different places. “War itself now spills across the landscapes and cityscapes of prosaic life. The image of the complete battle, separate from the civilian life around it, is antiquated, unreal” (Nordstrom 2004, 58). In other words, elsewheres increasingly do not exist but modern media conventions still attempt to keep them in place so that affective schemas like melodrama can still graze. To summarize, the affective framing of the general media spectacle prevents populations in Western liberal democracies from forming an idea of the suffering of the unfortunate, even when they may be in close geographical proximity. In certain senses, events like suicide bombings are simply assimilated into a particular media paratext that has already prepared a place for them—meaning that they can only figure in very limited ways as part of an already prepared affective template. So part of a politics of hope is the necessity of working on the affective episteme of Western populations so that they make connections with the world they currently may lack, and thereby create new entanglements that allow us to be moved in different ways and teach new things to ourselves (Callon and Rabeharisoa 2004). How, in other words, might we turn the politics of hope into a living, breathing presence? It is to this task of affective politics that I want to turn in this final section by mobilizing Arendt’s distinction in On Revolution between pity and compassion.29 For, at best, so I now want to argue, Western populations exhibit pity when what is really needed is compassion. Of course, there are at least four bystander states to be found in the available Western affective palette (Boltanski 1999; Cohen 2001). The first is that the misery of the unfortunate may simply be ignored and inspire no pity whatsoever. A dreadful event registers no claim and inspires only apathy. Another possibility is that those who are more fortunate may demonstrate a concern for the unfortunate that does not constitute a politics as such: rather it consists of a benevolent, patriarchal concern. Then there is the exercise of pity, an emotion that generalizes in order to deal with distance but, in order to generalize, it becomes eloquent, adding many words, thereby both recognizing itself as emotion and feeling and feeding on what it has conjured up. Pity, in other words, has an aesthetic quality that, in modern times, is best represented by melodrama. By comparison, as an outcome of entanglements that are close to the actors themselves, compassion has a practical character and, because it does not generalize, is not loquacious and shows no great interest in boosting emotion for its own sake. As a direct response to the expression of suffering, compassion is not ‘talkative and argumentative’ (Arendt 1990, 86). It is nonrepresentational and comes from the necessity inherent in the situation.30 It is local and practical and immanent. It is about making contact without falling back immediately on an abstract contract or a moral certainty. The unfortunate is never just anyone or any category. The question for me is how we can recover a politics of compassion to bring forth situations of necessity, rather than wallowing in a politics of pity that sounds grand, no doubt feels the victim’s pain, but, in its commitment to either relativism (as in genealogical explanations) or transcendence (as in notions of a primal human nature or good will), is too close to current forms of normative affective politics like melodrama to do more than produce a brief ethical hiatus. How can we, in other words, summon life by fashioning a politics of affect which can “keep the condition of life in mind and … make the condition of life count in the organization of behaviour” (Damasio 2003, 165), a goal that was, in all likelihood, affect’s original biological function? How can we, to use Arendt’s phrase, remain “fully alive”? Part of this politics, if that is not entirely too grand a word, would be an allegiance to two principles: first, that it is only possible to attain partial justice: to attain complete justice is to destroy another’s dream and would itself be unjust; second, that it is necessary to have the courage of one’s own ambivalence. It is not necessary to settle. Seasoning one’s claims with self-irony and modesty, cultivating a tolerance for moral ambiguity, periodically practicing normative self-reticence, building up a resistance to the pleasure of purity, minding your own business, doing what you can to forget to wreak vengeance, defending negative freedom even if there is no such thing, and playing around are the best you can do. But that’s quite a lot. (Bennett and Shapiro 2002, 22) Perhaps, then, all that holiness in the air would begin to dissipate a little and it would no longer be necessary to live death in life.
Gupta ‘15 /Indrani Das, M.Phil English Jamia Millia Islamia University, Hyper reality and Identity in a Postcolonial World, International Journal of Research, Vol. 2 Iss. 3, http://www.internationaljournalofresearch.org/index.php/ijr/article/view/1735/1632/
In the postcolonial contexts particularly, the distinctiveness of identity is predicated upon notion of space, “located elsewhere”. However, people who inhabit the peripheries, what Anzaldua called the “narrow strip along steep edges” (Gupta and Ferguson 7), forces us to rethink the identity/difference dichotomization. The structuring polarization between identity as positive and difference as negative needs to be questioned, and the need of the hour is to move along the lines of differences structured in accordance with the “precession of the model” to rethink the subjectivities configured in accordance with a logic of simulation (McCarthy xiii). With the places and localities becoming blurred and indeterminate in the implosion of the simulation of reference, Baudrillard’s fourth ‘fractal’ order, the erasure of all differences, has led to a renewed interest in the culturally and ethnic distinctions. Simulacra and hyperreality allows for a re-examination of the Postcolonial subject under question as well as problematize the production and dissemination of knowledge in relation to identity and cultural difference. In the hyperreal mode, the representation or image, no longer denotes the referent, as the sign has itself become the real. “The territory no longer precedes the map, but rather the map precedes the territory. The image bears no relation to reality, it is its own simulation” (Baudrillard 11). Hyperreality facilitates an interrogation of the ‘real’ in both colonialist and anti-colonialist discourses making us aware of Kristeva’s “writing as experience-limits” (Hutcheon 8). If identity established in these discourses is “no longer a question of imitation, nor duplication, nor even parody”, but “a question of substituting the signs of the real for the real” (Baudrillard 2), one could read that “colonialism and neo-imperialism are functions of a broader Western civilizational strategy of obfuscating the hidden absence of the ‘real’ by simulating reality as normative” ( qtd. in McCarthy ix). As William Merrin signals, Baudrillard’s work can be understood most fruitfully as occupying a space between historicity and philosophy. As an ideological site for the negotiation of postcoloniality, hyperreality allows postcolonial subjects to move beyond merely identifying with the past (with a retrograde voyeurism) to a deconstructive identification with unfixable and positional identities within the simulacrum (qtd. in McCarthy xx). Now, with the “whole edifice of representation, being a simulation” (Baudrillard 11), one needs to ask in the words of Clifford, “what processes rather than essences are involved in the present experience of cultural identity” (qtd. in Gupta and Ferguson 14). Hyperreality critiques “the imperialist and colonialist notions of purity as much as it question[s] the nationalist notions” (Bhabha 64). Baudrillard’s views on simulacra and hyperreality shifts the ground considerably, in its insistence to question what is at stake on the importance of “irreducible difference” (Grace 89). This ‘strategic essentialisms’ to use Spivak’s term, obfuscates the situatedness, locatedness which cannot be subsumed within the all-pervasive notions of identity based on oppositional binaries. Hyperreality tends to highlight the limitations of an identity based on the fragmented space of ‘imagined communities’ of a modern state. And the rapid advances in technology and the processes of globalization which have resulted in new configurations of margins and peripheries marked by migrations and the diasporic community, what is termed by Gupta and Ferguson, as ‘the transnational public sphere’ meaning that the fiction of the postcolonial nation- state, whose boundaries enclose cultures and regulate cultural exchange can no longer be sustained. Baudrillard’s description of consumptive society inundated with simulated images “offers a ‘paradoxical space” for the agency of the subject, facilitating both creative potential and selfdefining possibilities being also subjected identities to the law of the market. The “reversibility” implied in the “images preceding the real” is particularly important in terms of the debates around identity predicted on difference as it eventually shows the fictionality of all discourses about identity and cultural differences exemplifying the change implicit in “collective memory and orientation” (Rojek 115). Conclusion The world of Baudrillard cannot be said to be devoid of agency, or nihilistic as one is continuously aware of being a part of simulations, a world of consumption, which allows for “the radical operation of the interrogating the ‘otherness’ of the other” (Gupta and Ferguson 16). To conclude, hyperreality critiques the identity realized on what Arjun Appadurai has termed the “spatial incarceration of the native”, and allows for a rethinking of the relations between “culture, power, and space” (Gupta and Ferguson 17). ). Moreover, through the myriad images/signs which constitute our culture, our identity is constantly renewed and expanded with the “signs being appropriated, translated, rehistoricised and read anew” (Bhabha 37).",summarize the following text: ,"The old politics of waiting is therefore gradually replaced by a new politics of impatience and, if necessary, of disruption Brashness, disruption and a new anti-decorum ethos are meant to bring down the pretence of normality and the logics of normalization in this most “abnormal” society Steve Biko, Frantz Fanon and a plethora of black feminist, queer, postcolonial, decolonial and critical race theorists are being reloaded in the service of a new form of militancy less accommodationist and more trenchant both in form and content

Kenya has cooperated in areas of military, security and economic relations with the United States and its allies and arap Moi was seen as a close ally of the West. For example, American intelligence, including the Central Intelligence Agency, as well Israeli intelligences such as Mossad, Shabak (Israel Security Service) and Aman (Military Intelligence) have worked closely with Kenya. This was particularly the case alter Israel, with the support of Kenya, intervened to free Israeli and Jewish hostages from a hijacked Air France 139 plane that had originally left Athens for Paris in June 1976 and had been diverted to Benghazi, Libya and eventually Entebbe, Uganda. As the United States prepared for the 1991 Persian Gulf War, then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base, and to airlift men and materiel to the Gulf through the Nanyuki military airbase. For its tum, the administration of George H. Bush provided Moi with military assistance and the British govemment of Margaret Thatcher provided financial aid,"" These alliances were strengthened both on military and security front as well as on the economic front after 9/11. However, if the country did not have these military and maritime facilities and old strategic links with the United States, Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. In that sense Kenya's geostrategic location and resources were both a blessing and also a curse. Although, the United States and Kenya have enjoyed cordial relations since Kenya's independence, its foreign policy in the region, as elsewhere, has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, including in August 1998 and again in November 2002. The 1998 simultaneous terrorist bombings of United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the subsequent retaliation by the United States with cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan, once again focused international attention on the problem of terrorism. The twin bombings of the United States embassies injured 5,000 people and 224, including 12 Americans, were killed. Although the cold war threat posed by the competing superpower had declined, the threat from transnational actors had grown exponentially. The Bill Clinton administration insisted that terrorism was a defining issue of the post-cold war moment. In fact, in 1999, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright argued that ""We have said over and over again that [terrorism] is the biggest threat to our country and the world as we enter the 21st century.""""˜2 But terrorism does not occur in a vacuum. After the embassy bombings, Clinton suggested that the United States was attacked because of ""its dedication to political and religious freedom, economic opportunity, to respect for the rights of the individual."" Many international analysts and counterterrorism experts agree with Albright, especially in light of the possibility that terrorists may be able to buy, steal, or develop and produce weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Other high-level United States officials have acknowledged that terrorists are now more likely than at any point in history to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction. Yet most attention has been focused on a traditional, problem solving approach, of combating terrorism by deterring and disrupting it beforehand and retaliating against it after the fact."" In conventional terrorism studies, less so the more critical terrorism studies, inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists or their backers to launch attacks in the first place or to the images and narratives that inform terrorism."" Charles William Maynes, president of the Eurasia Foundation and former editor of Foreign Policy, was among those who suggested the need to examine the motives of those who support terrorism in order to lessen their grievances."" The Pentagon's Defense Science Board found that a strong correlation exists between the nature or at least the perception, of United States foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States."" Former United States President Bill Clinton also seemed to suggest such a link may be plausible,"" although most conservative commentators reject the view of a blowback from unpopular United States foreign policy."" Specifically, the Defense Science Board's 1997 Summer Study Task Force on the Department of Defense Responses to Transnational Threats noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism against the United States."" Moreover, the report stated that transnational terrorists and networks had at least three distinct advantages over territorially bound states: tirst, they may now have transnational access to weapons of mass destruction; second, the United States ""cannot easily deter them because they have no homeland"" and they draw on asymmetric strategies; and, third, ""they respect no boundaries, whether political, organizational, legal or moral."""" For its turn, the United States' global power means it is frequently called upon to respond to intemational crises and these often requires deploying military forces around the world. America's role, whether understood as a benign or ""reluctant imperialist or as a ""global cop"" in the world, invites reaction and resistance. In fact, at least four international surveys conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and WorldPublicOpinion.org during the George W. Bush administration found that world opinion viewed the United States as an ""unreliable"" global cop, which could not be trusted to ""act responsibly in the world."""" Alter the terrorist attacks in Kenya, the State Department later surveyed 260 diplomatic posts around the world and found 220 of them to be unsafe. A new report by the Accountability Review Board recommended that the State Department needed to spend upwards of $1.5 billion a year-five times current outlays on embassy security-for a decade to better protect United States missions. Yet a cheaper and much more effective way to protect American facilities and national interests might be to adopt a more restrained foreign policy. Instead of being a global cop of first resort, Washington should be the balancer of last resort, intervening only where allied states are unable to act and the United States has vital or at least serious interests at stake. Despite the August 1998 bombings of the United States embassy or the 2002 bombing ofthe Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, prior to 9/1 1, the United States had spent only between US$l to US$3 million on counterterrorism in the country."" This figure increased dramatically over the next few years. The Washington D.C.-based Center for Public Integrity found that Kenya became one of the major recipients of United States counterterrorism funding in the East Africa region, and received funds from at least three different United States counterterrorism initiatives. First, between 9/ ll and 2003, Kenya received an estimated US$22 million from the United States' Foreign Military Financing Program. Second, ofthe US$l00 million allocated by the Bush administration for counterterrorism in the Horn of Africa, Kenya alone received between US$30 to US$40 million."" Third, between 2002 and 2007, Kenya was a major recipient of a new Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship established by the United States Department of Defense, receiving an estimated US$l.l million dollars."" However, travel advice not to visit Kenya because of the threat of terrorist attacks reduced the potential of tourism and, thus, undermined the new government's overall proj ect of securing economic and political renewal through cotmterterrorism initiatives. The United States' presence and support functioned to attract terrorists both to, and within Kenya, as many terrorist plots and attacks were directed at United States institutions or those of its allies, such as Israel. The United States believed that supporters of al-Ittihad al-Islamia, which it identified as ""a Somali terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda,""2*""˜ had infiltrated some of the refugee camps in North-Eastern province of Kenya, and had made their way to Mombasa and Eastleigh, the Nairobi quarters inhabited primarily by Somalis. The United States also believed that terrorists ""they may well have gained support among the thousands of unemployed youths, hit by the decline of the tourism industry,""'Â° And, in both the 1998 bombing on the United States embassy and the attack on the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, some Kenyans were implicated, as well as in other terrorist activities in Asia. The United States regards Kenya as one of the four ""anchor states"" in sub- Saharan Africa, yet it has heightened concerns over the penetration by al-Qaeda. One possible conclusion is that the weakening of the country's counterterrorism institutions happened because of the decay and politicization of the security apparatus during the Kenyan African National Union (KANU) rule, which lasted for 38 years after the country's independence from Britain. This fueled calls for reform and the election of Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party who, along with a coalition of opposition allies formed the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) that came to power in December 2002. This popular demand for reform also helps explain the timing of the pressure on the government to deal with terrorism. Raising the ""scare level"" and hiking the costs of inactivity on terrorism helped to create a lot more local acceptance for the actions necessary to deal with the threat. According to Strategic Survey, United States actions in Kenya ""mean Washington will have a standing, if secondary, interest in strengthening Kenyan institutions and in ""˜inoculating' its Muslim population against radicalization through longer- term development programs.""3Â° Post-Cold War and the Reshaping of Kenyan Foreign Policy During the cold war, Kenya's president Daniel arap Moi 's support was important for the United States, even as the superpower's military interventions often led to the destabilization of progressive regimes in the East Africa region. The often strong- armed and anti-democratic methods deployed by arap Moi against his opponents alter a failed coup d'ê1at in l982 did not seem to bother either the United States or European allies. In the post-cold war Kenya both arap Moi and his successor Kibaki continued to play a crucial role in the United States' geostrategic aims both in the East Africa region as well as in West Asia. Both Bush administrations were granted access to Kenya to conduct wars against Iraq, In 1991 George H. Bush, and in 2003 his son, George W. Bush, was granted permission for American troops to use basing facilities and logistical support as the United States prepared for war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. While some scholars argued that United States foreign policy was based on a kind of Wilsonian democracy, other scholars insist its actions were based primarily on geostrategic interests, as demonstrated by the shifting military and economic policies from the cold war to the ""war on terror,"" and particularly by the willingness of both Bush administrations to allow strategic national interests to trump support for democracy and human rights. In an exploration of United States foreign policy toward Africa, Korwa G. Adar argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in great opportunity for the pursuit of foreign policy based on Wilsonianism. This foreign policy trend emerged within the United States' foreign policymaking establishment in favor of the pursuit of democracy and human rights policy in Africa during decolonization and independence struggles. While these principles surfaced periodically throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations, the spirit of Wilsonianism gave way to cold war principles based on national interests and specifically on anti- communism. Alter a state visit to Africa from February 28 to March 21 1957, Wee-President Richard Nixon explained in his report to President Dwight D. Eisenhower that, ""the course of Africa's development could well prove to be the decisive factor between the forces of freedom and intemational communism?"" The linkage of Wilsonianism to foreign policy and development acquired a central theme during the height of the cold war under Ronald Reagan administration as well as under President George H. Bush following the collapse of the Soviet Union, The former United States advisor to the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, Marc Northem, interjected, at least rhetorically, that Wilsonian principles were an important part ofthe Bush administration's foreign policy and its promotion of democracy and human rights. In his address to the Human Rights Commission, Northem stated that, ""the US makes no apology for insisting that where human rights are concerned, every nation, including my own must be held to the highest standard. We stand ready to help those governments committed to human rights move ahead,"""" He further emphasized that, ""the division in the world today is not bctwccn East and West. The real division in the world is between those committed to democracy and liberty and those against."""" This rhetorical interjection of Wilsonian democratic principles did not, however, manifest in any significant way until the 1990s. In 1989 the George H. Bush administration initially was opposed to cutting foreign aid to some of the leading African old guards-cum-dictators such as arap Moi (Kenya), Siad Barre (Somalia), and Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, now Democratic Republic ofthe Congo). Later, however, the same dictators, including arap Moi, were to face political conditionalities as part of the World Bank and Intemational Monetary Fund's promotion of structural adjustment programs in the late 1980s and in the 1990s. The United States and other donor countries strongly supported the imposition of these conditionalities in Africa and, in fact, the principles were known as the ""Washington Consensus."" Kenya's relationship with the United States and other donor countries in general began to deteriorate in 1989. The years 1989-91 witnessed great intemal and intemational pressure on the~Kenyan Govemment to allow multipartism. The then United States ambassador to Kenya, Hempstone Smith, brushing diplomatic ethics aside, stated publicly that United States assistance would be directed to countries that ""nourished democratic institutions, defended human rights and practiced multiparty politics.""""""˜ In conformity with Section 116 of the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibited support for regimes that flaunted democratic and human rights principles, as well as other democracy and human rights legislation, George H. Bush acquiesced to the Congressional freezing of US$25 million in military aid to Kenya."" Kenya's foreign aid was subsequently withheld by the United States and other donors in 1991, forcing the arap Moi regime to allow multipartism, but it was not until 2002, some 24 years after gaining power, that Kenya swore in a new president. Kenya's Foreign Policy under the Kibaki Presidency The United States was interested in seeing Kenya succeed in consolidating democratic change and revitalizing its economy, both of which would serve longstanding interests in democracy and human rights as well as the strategic and security concerns. During the cold war, President arap Moi was a staunch anti- communist ally of the United States, and in the ""war on terror"" context, Kenya once again emerged as a reliable ally, and as a key African strategic partner in George W. Bush's September 2002 National Security Strategy. As one of the more ""stable"" countries in the Horn of Africa, Kenya was an important regional partner in the United States sub-regional command in neighboring Djibouti where a large Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contingent and 1,000 United States troops were stationed to counteract terrorist cells believed to be operating in Somalia and Yemen; to prevent al-Qaeda operatives from lieeing to the Hom of Ah'ica; and protect commercial and military sea lanes, especially from piracy in the Gulf of Aden. After 9/ l 1 , the Bush administration renewed airbase, port access, and over- Bight agreements with the Kenyan government, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld traveled to the region in early December 2002 to make a case for stronger security cooperation. Of the $20 million in supplemental funds authorized by the United States Congress in October 2002 to strengthen counterterrorist security in Africa, $15 million was earmarked for Kenya. This attested to United States recognition not only of Kenya's regional importance but also to the country's acute vulnerability as a soft target and conduit for terrorist activities. Kenya has served, and will likely serve again, as an important humanitarian platfonn for United States assistance going to southern Sudan, Somalia, the Great Lakes region, and Ethiopia and Eritrea. The role of Kenya as an ally goes beyond the single issue of counterterrorism. For more than a decade, Operation Lifeline Sudan has been a vital conduit of humanitarian relief to southern Sudan from its base in Turkana District."" Kenya also provided a haven to thousands of Somali refugees. In his last year in office, Moi played an important role in efforts to end the civil war in Sudan, building on the peace initiatives of former United States Senator John Danforth. This initiative led to the Machakos Protocol on the issue of self-determination for southern Sudan. The United States has a large presence in Kenya, including its embassy and the United States Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) mission, which are among the largest in Africa. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has made an exceptional investment in public health in Kenya, particularly to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria. As a result of default foreign policy based on terrorism and United States involvement, Muslim communities in Coast Province were offended by what they perceived to be heavy-handed investigations by both the Kenyan security forces and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Mombasa bombing in 2002 did not evoke a similar response, partly because the number of casualties was much lower, but also because Kenya's domestic attention was focused on the election. It is likely, however, that the al-Qaeda attack in Mombasa, like that in Bali earlier in 2002, was intended in part to chill Kenyan enthusiasm for continued partnership with the United States and to demonstrate al-Qaeda's ability to strike in the Hom of Africa, despite the United States' expanding security engagement. The United States' expanded militarization of the sub-region corresponded with a growing sense of vulnerability among Kenyans, which is likely to persist as long as the United States remains in the region and deepen its security cooperation with Kenya. For domestic politicians there is reason to fear the electoral consequences of deepening security cooperation in the ""war on terror,"" as Kenyan grow weary of being placed in the frontline of the war against terrorism, and worried about the prospects for another catastrophe of the proportions of the embassy bombings or worse. Kenyans, particularly along the Coast and Northe&tern Provinces also had reservation about being drawn into a coniiict which entailed eradicating Al-Ittihad in Somalia and sowing future seeds for interregional and religious conliicts among neighboring countries,.",summarize the following text: ,"then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base These alliances were strengthened on military and security front after 9/11 if the country did not have these military facilities Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. its foreign policy in the region has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, terrorists are now more likely than at any point to obtain and use w m d inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists to launch attacks in the first place a strong correlation exists between the perception, of U S foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks the Defense Science Board noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism America's role as reluctant imperialist or global cop invites resistance a much more effective way to protect America might be to adopt a more restrained foreign policy.

Kenya has cooperated in areas of military, security and economic relations with the United States and its allies and arap Moi was seen as a close ally of the West. For example, American intelligence, including the Central Intelligence Agency, as well Israeli intelligences such as Mossad, Shabak (Israel Security Service) and Aman (Military Intelligence) have worked closely with Kenya. This was particularly the case alter Israel, with the support of Kenya, intervened to free Israeli and Jewish hostages from a hijacked Air France 139 plane that had originally left Athens for Paris in June 1976 and had been diverted to Benghazi, Libya and eventually Entebbe, Uganda. As the United States prepared for the 1991 Persian Gulf War, then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base, and to airlift men and materiel to the Gulf through the Nanyuki military airbase. For its tum, the administration of George H. Bush provided Moi with military assistance and the British govemment of Margaret Thatcher provided financial aid,"" These alliances were strengthened both on military and security front as well as on the economic front after 9/11. However, if the country did not have these military and maritime facilities and old strategic links with the United States, Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. In that sense Kenya's geostrategic location and resources were both a blessing and also a curse. Although, the United States and Kenya have enjoyed cordial relations since Kenya's independence, its foreign policy in the region, as elsewhere, has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, including in August 1998 and again in November 2002. The 1998 simultaneous terrorist bombings of United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the subsequent retaliation by the United States with cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan, once again focused international attention on the problem of terrorism. The twin bombings of the United States embassies injured 5,000 people and 224, including 12 Americans, were killed. Although the cold war threat posed by the competing superpower had declined, the threat from transnational actors had grown exponentially. The Bill Clinton administration insisted that terrorism was a defining issue of the post-cold war moment. In fact, in 1999, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright argued that ""We have said over and over again that [terrorism] is the biggest threat to our country and the world as we enter the 21st century.""""˜2 But terrorism does not occur in a vacuum. After the embassy bombings, Clinton suggested that the United States was attacked because of ""its dedication to political and religious freedom, economic opportunity, to respect for the rights of the individual."" Many international analysts and counterterrorism experts agree with Albright, especially in light of the possibility that terrorists may be able to buy, steal, or develop and produce weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Other high-level United States officials have acknowledged that terrorists are now more likely than at any point in history to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction. Yet most attention has been focused on a traditional, problem solving approach, of combating terrorism by deterring and disrupting it beforehand and retaliating against it after the fact."" In conventional terrorism studies, less so the more critical terrorism studies, inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists or their backers to launch attacks in the first place or to the images and narratives that inform terrorism."" Charles William Maynes, president of the Eurasia Foundation and former editor of Foreign Policy, was among those who suggested the need to examine the motives of those who support terrorism in order to lessen their grievances."" The Pentagon's Defense Science Board found that a strong correlation exists between the nature or at least the perception, of United States foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States."" Former United States President Bill Clinton also seemed to suggest such a link may be plausible,"" although most conservative commentators reject the view of a blowback from unpopular United States foreign policy."" Specifically, the Defense Science Board's 1997 Summer Study Task Force on the Department of Defense Responses to Transnational Threats noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism against the United States."" Moreover, the report stated that transnational terrorists and networks had at least three distinct advantages over territorially bound states: tirst, they may now have transnational access to weapons of mass destruction; second, the United States ""cannot easily deter them because they have no homeland"" and they draw on asymmetric strategies; and, third, ""they respect no boundaries, whether political, organizational, legal or moral."""" For its turn, the United States' global power means it is frequently called upon to respond to intemational crises and these often requires deploying military forces around the world. America's role, whether understood as a benign or ""reluctant imperialist or as a ""global cop"" in the world, invites reaction and resistance. In fact, at least four international surveys conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and WorldPublicOpinion.org during the George W. Bush administration found that world opinion viewed the United States as an ""unreliable"" global cop, which could not be trusted to ""act responsibly in the world."""" Alter the terrorist attacks in Kenya, the State Department later surveyed 260 diplomatic posts around the world and found 220 of them to be unsafe. A new report by the Accountability Review Board recommended that the State Department needed to spend upwards of $1.5 billion a year-five times current outlays on embassy security-for a decade to better protect United States missions.

The Bill Clinton administration insisted that terrorism was a defining issue of the post-cold war moment. In fact, in 1999, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright argued that ""We have said over and over again that [terrorism] is the biggest threat to our country and the world as we enter the 21st century.""""˜2 But terrorism does not occur in a vacuum. After the embassy bombings, Clinton suggested that the United States was attacked because of ""its dedication to political and religious freedom, economic opportunity, to respect for the rights of the individual."" Many international analysts and counterterrorism experts agree with Albright, especially in light of the possibility that terrorists may be able to buy, steal, or develop and produce weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Other high-level United States officials have acknowledged that terrorists are now more likely than at any point in history to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction. Yet most attention has been focused on a traditional, problem solving approach, of combating terrorism by deterring and disrupting it beforehand and retaliating against it after the fact."" In conventional terrorism studies, less so the more critical terrorism studies, inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists or their backers to launch attacks in the first place or to the images and narratives that inform terrorism."" Charles William Maynes, president of the Eurasia Foundation and former editor of Foreign Policy, was among those who suggested the need to examine the motives of those who support terrorism in order to lessen their grievances."" The Pentagon's Defense Science Board found that a strong correlation exists between the nature or at least the perception, of United States foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States."" Former United States President Bill Clinton also seemed to suggest such a link may be plausible,"" although most conservative commentators reject the view of a blowback from unpopular United States foreign policy."" Specifically, the Defense Science Board's 1997 Summer Study Task Force on the Department of Defense Responses to Transnational Threats noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism against the United States."" Moreover, the report stated that transnational terrorists and networks had at least three distinct advantages over territorially bound states: tirst, they may now have transnational access to weapons of mass destruction; second, the United States ""cannot easily deter them because they have no homeland"" and they draw on asymmetric strategies; and, third, ""they respect no boundaries, whether political, organizational, legal or moral."""" For its turn, the United States' global power means it is frequently called upon to respond to intemational crises and these often requires deploying military forces around the world. America's role, whether understood as a benign or ""reluctant imperialist or as a ""global cop"" in the world, invites reaction and resistance. In fact, at least four international surveys conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and WorldPublicOpinion.org during the George W. Bush administration found that world opinion viewed the United States as an ""unreliable"" global cop, which could not be trusted to ""act responsibly in the world."""" Alter the terrorist attacks in Kenya, the State Department later surveyed 260 diplomatic posts around the world and found 220 of them to be unsafe. A new report by the Accountability Review Board recommended that the State Department needed to spend upwards of $1.5 billion a year-five times current outlays on embassy security-for a decade to better protect United States missions. Yet a cheaper and much more effective way to protect American facilities and national interests might be to adopt a more restrained foreign policy. Instead of being a global cop of first resort, Washington should be the balancer of last resort, intervening only where allied states are unable to act and the United States has vital or at least serious interests at stake. Despite the August 1998 bombings of the United States embassy or the 2002 bombing ofthe Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, prior to 9/1 1, the United States had spent only between US$l to US$3 million on counterterrorism in the country."" This figure increased dramatically over the next few years. The Washington D.C.-based Center for Public Integrity found that Kenya became one of the major recipients of United States counterterrorism funding in the East Africa region, and received funds from at least three different United States counterterrorism initiatives. First, between 9/ ll and 2003, Kenya received an estimated US$22 million from the United States' Foreign Military Financing Program. Second, ofthe US$l00 million allocated by the Bush administration for counterterrorism in the Horn of Africa, Kenya alone received between US$30 to US$40 million."" Third, between 2002 and 2007, Kenya was a major recipient of a new Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship established by the United States Department of Defense, receiving an estimated US$l.l million dollars."" However, travel advice not to visit Kenya because of the threat of terrorist attacks reduced the potential of tourism and, thus, undermined the new government's overall proj ect of securing economic and political renewal through cotmterterrorism initiatives. The United States' presence and support functioned to attract terrorists both to, and within Kenya, as many terrorist plots and attacks were directed at United States institutions or those of its allies, such as Israel. The United States believed that supporters of al-Ittihad al-Islamia, which it identified as ""a Somali terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda,""2*""˜ had infiltrated some of the refugee camps in North-Eastern province of Kenya, and had made their way to Mombasa and Eastleigh, the Nairobi quarters inhabited primarily by Somalis. The United States also believed that terrorists ""they may well have gained support among the thousands of unemployed youths, hit by the decline of the tourism industry,""'Â° And, in both the 1998 bombing on the United States embassy and the attack on the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, some Kenyans were implicated, as well as in other terrorist activities in Asia. The United States regards Kenya as one of the four ""anchor states"" in sub- Saharan Africa, yet it has heightened concerns over the penetration by al-Qaeda. One possible conclusion is that the weakening of the country's counterterrorism institutions happened because of the decay and politicization of the security apparatus during the Kenyan African National Union (KANU) rule, which lasted for 38 years after the country's independence from Britain. This fueled calls for reform and the election of Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party who, along with a coalition of opposition allies formed the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) that came to power in December 2002. This popular demand for reform also helps explain the timing of the pressure on the government to deal with terrorism. Raising the ""scare level"" and hiking the costs of inactivity on terrorism helped to create a lot more local acceptance for the actions necessary to deal with the threat. According to Strategic Survey, United States actions in Kenya ""mean Washington will have a standing, if secondary, interest in strengthening Kenyan institutions and in ""˜inoculating' its Muslim population against radicalization through longer- term development programs.""3Â° Post-Cold War and the Reshaping of Kenyan Foreign Policy During the cold war, Kenya's president Daniel arap Moi 's support was important for the United States, even as the superpower's military interventions often led to the destabilization of progressive regimes in the East Africa region. The often strong- armed and anti-democratic methods deployed by arap Moi against his opponents alter a failed coup d'ê1at in l982 did not seem to bother either the United States or European allies. In the post-cold war Kenya both arap Moi and his successor Kibaki continued to play a crucial role in the United States' geostrategic aims both in the East Africa region as well as in West Asia. Both Bush administrations were granted access to Kenya to conduct wars against Iraq, In 1991 George H. Bush, and in 2003 his son, George W. Bush, was granted permission for American troops to use basing facilities and logistical support as the United States prepared for war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. While some scholars argued that United States foreign policy was based on a kind of Wilsonian democracy, other scholars insist its actions were based primarily on geostrategic interests, as demonstrated by the shifting military and economic policies from the cold war to the ""war on terror,"" and particularly by the willingness of both Bush administrations to allow strategic national interests to trump support for democracy and human rights. In an exploration of United States foreign policy toward Africa, Korwa G. Adar argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in great opportunity for the pursuit of foreign policy based on Wilsonianism. This foreign policy trend emerged within the United States' foreign policymaking establishment in favor of the pursuit of democracy and human rights policy in Africa during decolonization and independence struggles. While these principles surfaced periodically throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations, the spirit of Wilsonianism gave way to cold war principles based on national interests and specifically on anti- communism. Alter a state visit to Africa from February 28 to March 21 1957, Wee-President Richard Nixon explained in his report to President Dwight D. Eisenhower that, ""the course of Africa's development could well prove to be the decisive factor between the forces of freedom and intemational communism?"" The linkage of Wilsonianism to foreign policy and development acquired a central theme during the height of the cold war under Ronald Reagan administration as well as under President George H. Bush following the collapse of the Soviet Union, The former United States advisor to the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, Marc Northem, interjected, at least rhetorically, that Wilsonian principles were an important part ofthe Bush administration's foreign policy and its promotion of democracy and human rights. In his address to the Human Rights Commission, Northem stated that, ""the US makes no apology for insisting that where human rights are concerned, every nation, including my own must be held to the highest standard. We stand ready to help those governments committed to human rights move ahead,"""" He further emphasized that, ""the division in the world today is not bctwccn East and West. The real division in the world is between those committed to democracy and liberty and those against."""" This rhetorical interjection of Wilsonian democratic principles did not, however, manifest in any significant way until the 1990s. In 1989 the George H. Bush administration initially was opposed to cutting foreign aid to some of the leading African old guards-cum-dictators such as arap Moi (Kenya), Siad Barre (Somalia), and Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, now Democratic Republic ofthe Congo). Later, however, the same dictators, including arap Moi, were to face political conditionalities as part of the World Bank and Intemational Monetary Fund's promotion of structural adjustment programs in the late 1980s and in the 1990s. The United States and other donor countries strongly supported the imposition of these conditionalities in Africa and, in fact, the principles were known as the ""Washington Consensus."" Kenya's relationship with the United States and other donor countries in general began to deteriorate in 1989. The years 1989-91 witnessed great intemal and intemational pressure on the~Kenyan Govemment to allow multipartism. The then United States ambassador to Kenya, Hempstone Smith, brushing diplomatic ethics aside, stated publicly that United States assistance would be directed to countries that ""nourished democratic institutions, defended human rights and practiced multiparty politics.""""""˜ In conformity with Section 116 of the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibited support for regimes that flaunted democratic and human rights principles, as well as other democracy and human rights legislation, George H. Bush acquiesced to the Congressional freezing of US$25 million in military aid to Kenya."" Kenya's foreign aid was subsequently withheld by the United States and other donors in 1991, forcing the arap Moi regime to allow multipartism, but it was not until 2002, some 24 years after gaining power, that Kenya swore in a new president. Kenya's Foreign Policy under the Kibaki Presidency The United States was interested in seeing Kenya succeed in consolidating democratic change and revitalizing its economy, both of which would serve longstanding interests in democracy and human rights as well as the strategic and security concerns. During the cold war, President arap Moi was a staunch anti- communist ally of the United States, and in the ""war on terror"" context, Kenya once again emerged as a reliable ally, and as a key African strategic partner in George W. Bush's September 2002 National Security Strategy. As one of the more ""stable"" countries in the Horn of Africa, Kenya was an important regional partner in the United States sub-regional command in neighboring Djibouti where a large Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contingent and 1,000 United States troops were stationed to counteract terrorist cells believed to be operating in Somalia and Yemen; to prevent al-Qaeda operatives from lieeing to the Hom of Ah'ica; and protect commercial and military sea lanes, especially from piracy in the Gulf of Aden. After 9/ l 1 , the Bush administration renewed airbase, port access, and over- Bight agreements with the Kenyan government, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld traveled to the region in early December 2002 to make a case for stronger security cooperation. Of the $20 million in supplemental funds authorized by the United States Congress in October 2002 to strengthen counterterrorist security in Africa, $15 million was earmarked for Kenya. This attested to United States recognition not only of Kenya's regional importance but also to the country's acute vulnerability as a soft target and conduit for terrorist activities. Kenya has served, and will likely serve again, as an important humanitarian platfonn for United States assistance going to southern Sudan, Somalia, the Great Lakes region, and Ethiopia and Eritrea. The role of Kenya as an ally goes beyond the single issue of counterterrorism. For more than a decade, Operation Lifeline Sudan has been a vital conduit of humanitarian relief to southern Sudan from its base in Turkana District."" Kenya also provided a haven to thousands of Somali refugees. In his last year in office, Moi played an important role in efforts to end the civil war in Sudan, building on the peace initiatives of former United States Senator John Danforth. This initiative led to the Machakos Protocol on the issue of self-determination for southern Sudan. The United States has a large presence in Kenya, including its embassy and the United States Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) mission, which are among the largest in Africa. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has made an exceptional investment in public health in Kenya, particularly to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria. As a result of default foreign policy based on terrorism and United States involvement, Muslim communities in Coast Province were offended by what they perceived to be heavy-handed investigations by both the Kenyan security forces and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Mombasa bombing in 2002 did not evoke a similar response, partly because the number of casualties was much lower, but also because Kenya's domestic attention was focused on the election. It is likely, however, that the al-Qaeda attack in Mombasa, like that in Bali earlier in 2002, was intended in part to chill Kenyan enthusiasm for continued partnership with the United States and to demonstrate al-Qaeda's ability to strike in the Hom of Africa, despite the United States' expanding security engagement. The United States' expanded militarization of the sub-region corresponded with a growing sense of vulnerability among Kenyans, which is likely to persist as long as the United States remains in the region and deepen its security cooperation with Kenya. For domestic politicians there is reason to fear the electoral consequences of deepening security cooperation in the ""war on terror,"" as Kenyan grow weary of being placed in the frontline of the war against terrorism, and worried about the prospects for another catastrophe of the proportions of the embassy bombings or worse. Kenyans, particularly along the Coast and Northe&tern Provinces also had reservation about being drawn into a coniiict which entailed eradicating Al-Ittihad in Somalia and sowing future seeds for interregional and religious conliicts among neighboring countries,.",summarize the following text: ,"then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base These alliances were strengthened on military and security front after 9/11 if the country did not have these military facilities Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. its foreign policy in the region has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, terrorists are now more likely than at any point to obtain and use w m d inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists to launch attacks in the first place a strong correlation exists between the perception, of U S foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks the Defense Science Board noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism America's role as reluctant imperialist or global cop invites resistance a much more effective way to protect America might be to adopt a more restrained foreign policy.

Kenya has cooperated in areas of military, security and economic relations with the United States and its allies and arap Moi was seen as a close ally of the West. For example, American intelligence, including the Central Intelligence Agency, as well Israeli intelligences such as Mossad, Shabak (Israel Security Service) and Aman (Military Intelligence) have worked closely with Kenya. This was particularly the case alter Israel, with the support of Kenya, intervened to free Israeli and Jewish hostages from a hijacked Air France 139 plane that had originally left Athens for Paris in June 1976 and had been diverted to Benghazi, Libya and eventually Entebbe, Uganda. As the United States prepared for the 1991 Persian Gulf War, then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base, and to airlift men and materiel to the Gulf through the Nanyuki military airbase. For its tum, the administration of George H. Bush provided Moi with military assistance and the British govemment of Margaret Thatcher provided financial aid,"" These alliances were strengthened both on military and security front as well as on the economic front after 9/11. However, if the country did not have these military and maritime facilities and old strategic links with the United States, Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. In that sense Kenya's geostrategic location and resources were both a blessing and also a curse. Although, the United States and Kenya have enjoyed cordial relations since Kenya's independence, its foreign policy in the region, as elsewhere, has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, including in August 1998 and again in November 2002. The 1998 simultaneous terrorist bombings of United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the subsequent retaliation by the United States with cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan, once again focused international attention on the problem of terrorism. The twin bombings of the United States embassies injured 5,000 people and 224, including 12 Americans, were killed.

Kenya has cooperated in areas of military, security and economic relations with the United States and its allies and arap Moi was seen as a close ally of the West. For example, American intelligence, including the Central Intelligence Agency, as well Israeli intelligences such as Mossad, Shabak (Israel Security Service) and Aman (Military Intelligence) have worked closely with Kenya. This was particularly the case alter Israel, with the support of Kenya, intervened to free Israeli and Jewish hostages from a hijacked Air France 139 plane that had originally left Athens for Paris in June 1976 and had been diverted to Benghazi, Libya and eventually Entebbe, Uganda. As the United States prepared for the 1991 Persian Gulf War, then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base, and to airlift men and materiel to the Gulf through the Nanyuki military airbase. For its tum, the administration of George H. Bush provided Moi with military assistance and the British govemment of Margaret Thatcher provided financial aid,"" These alliances were strengthened both on military and security front as well as on the economic front after 9/11. However, if the country did not have these military and maritime facilities and old strategic links with the United States, Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. In that sense Kenya's geostrategic location and resources were both a blessing and also a curse. Although, the United States and Kenya have enjoyed cordial relations since Kenya's independence, its foreign policy in the region, as elsewhere, has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, including in August 1998 and again in November 2002. The 1998 simultaneous terrorist bombings of United States embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and the subsequent retaliation by the United States with cruise missile strikes against Afghanistan and Sudan, once again focused international attention on the problem of terrorism. The twin bombings of the United States embassies injured 5,000 people and 224, including 12 Americans, were killed. Although the cold war threat posed by the competing superpower had declined, the threat from transnational actors had grown exponentially. The Bill Clinton administration insisted that terrorism was a defining issue of the post-cold war moment. In fact, in 1999, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright argued that ""We have said over and over again that [terrorism] is the biggest threat to our country and the world as we enter the 21st century.""""˜2 But terrorism does not occur in a vacuum. After the embassy bombings, Clinton suggested that the United States was attacked because of ""its dedication to political and religious freedom, economic opportunity, to respect for the rights of the individual."" Many international analysts and counterterrorism experts agree with Albright, especially in light of the possibility that terrorists may be able to buy, steal, or develop and produce weapons of mass destruction, whether nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Other high-level United States officials have acknowledged that terrorists are now more likely than at any point in history to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction. Yet most attention has been focused on a traditional, problem solving approach, of combating terrorism by deterring and disrupting it beforehand and retaliating against it after the fact."" In conventional terrorism studies, less so the more critical terrorism studies, inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists or their backers to launch attacks in the first place or to the images and narratives that inform terrorism."" Charles William Maynes, president of the Eurasia Foundation and former editor of Foreign Policy, was among those who suggested the need to examine the motives of those who support terrorism in order to lessen their grievances."" The Pentagon's Defense Science Board found that a strong correlation exists between the nature or at least the perception, of United States foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks against the United States."" Former United States President Bill Clinton also seemed to suggest such a link may be plausible,"" although most conservative commentators reject the view of a blowback from unpopular United States foreign policy."" Specifically, the Defense Science Board's 1997 Summer Study Task Force on the Department of Defense Responses to Transnational Threats noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism against the United States."" Moreover, the report stated that transnational terrorists and networks had at least three distinct advantages over territorially bound states: tirst, they may now have transnational access to weapons of mass destruction; second, the United States ""cannot easily deter them because they have no homeland"" and they draw on asymmetric strategies; and, third, ""they respect no boundaries, whether political, organizational, legal or moral."""" For its turn, the United States' global power means it is frequently called upon to respond to intemational crises and these often requires deploying military forces around the world. America's role, whether understood as a benign or ""reluctant imperialist or as a ""global cop"" in the world, invites reaction and resistance. In fact, at least four international surveys conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and WorldPublicOpinion.org during the George W. Bush administration found that world opinion viewed the United States as an ""unreliable"" global cop, which could not be trusted to ""act responsibly in the world."""" Alter the terrorist attacks in Kenya, the State Department later surveyed 260 diplomatic posts around the world and found 220 of them to be unsafe. A new report by the Accountability Review Board recommended that the State Department needed to spend upwards of $1.5 billion a year-five times current outlays on embassy security-for a decade to better protect United States missions. Yet a cheaper and much more effective way to protect American facilities and national interests might be to adopt a more restrained foreign policy. Instead of being a global cop of first resort, Washington should be the balancer of last resort, intervening only where allied states are unable to act and the United States has vital or at least serious interests at stake. Despite the August 1998 bombings of the United States embassy or the 2002 bombing ofthe Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, Kenya, prior to 9/1 1, the United States had spent only between US$l to US$3 million on counterterrorism in the country."" This figure increased dramatically over the next few years. The Washington D.C.-based Center for Public Integrity found that Kenya became one of the major recipients of United States counterterrorism funding in the East Africa region, and received funds from at least three different United States counterterrorism initiatives. First, between 9/ ll and 2003, Kenya received an estimated US$22 million from the United States' Foreign Military Financing Program. Second, ofthe US$l00 million allocated by the Bush administration for counterterrorism in the Horn of Africa, Kenya alone received between US$30 to US$40 million."" Third, between 2002 and 2007, Kenya was a major recipient of a new Regional Defense Counterterrorism Fellowship established by the United States Department of Defense, receiving an estimated US$l.l million dollars."" However, travel advice not to visit Kenya because of the threat of terrorist attacks reduced the potential of tourism and, thus, undermined the new government's overall proj ect of securing economic and political renewal through cotmterterrorism initiatives. The United States' presence and support functioned to attract terrorists both to, and within Kenya, as many terrorist plots and attacks were directed at United States institutions or those of its allies, such as Israel. The United States believed that supporters of al-Ittihad al-Islamia, which it identified as ""a Somali terrorist organization with links to al-Qaeda,""2*""˜ had infiltrated some of the refugee camps in North-Eastern province of Kenya, and had made their way to Mombasa and Eastleigh, the Nairobi quarters inhabited primarily by Somalis. The United States also believed that terrorists ""they may well have gained support among the thousands of unemployed youths, hit by the decline of the tourism industry,""'Â° And, in both the 1998 bombing on the United States embassy and the attack on the Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, some Kenyans were implicated, as well as in other terrorist activities in Asia. The United States regards Kenya as one of the four ""anchor states"" in sub- Saharan Africa, yet it has heightened concerns over the penetration by al-Qaeda. One possible conclusion is that the weakening of the country's counterterrorism institutions happened because of the decay and politicization of the security apparatus during the Kenyan African National Union (KANU) rule, which lasted for 38 years after the country's independence from Britain. This fueled calls for reform and the election of Mwai Kibaki of the Democratic Party who, along with a coalition of opposition allies formed the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC) that came to power in December 2002. This popular demand for reform also helps explain the timing of the pressure on the government to deal with terrorism. Raising the ""scare level"" and hiking the costs of inactivity on terrorism helped to create a lot more local acceptance for the actions necessary to deal with the threat. According to Strategic Survey, United States actions in Kenya ""mean Washington will have a standing, if secondary, interest in strengthening Kenyan institutions and in ""˜inoculating' its Muslim population against radicalization through longer- term development programs.""3Â° Post-Cold War and the Reshaping of Kenyan Foreign Policy During the cold war, Kenya's president Daniel arap Moi 's support was important for the United States, even as the superpower's military interventions often led to the destabilization of progressive regimes in the East Africa region. The often strong- armed and anti-democratic methods deployed by arap Moi against his opponents alter a failed coup d'ê1at in l982 did not seem to bother either the United States or European allies. In the post-cold war Kenya both arap Moi and his successor Kibaki continued to play a crucial role in the United States' geostrategic aims both in the East Africa region as well as in West Asia. Both Bush administrations were granted access to Kenya to conduct wars against Iraq, In 1991 George H. Bush, and in 2003 his son, George W. Bush, was granted permission for American troops to use basing facilities and logistical support as the United States prepared for war against Saddam Hussein's Iraq. While some scholars argued that United States foreign policy was based on a kind of Wilsonian democracy, other scholars insist its actions were based primarily on geostrategic interests, as demonstrated by the shifting military and economic policies from the cold war to the ""war on terror,"" and particularly by the willingness of both Bush administrations to allow strategic national interests to trump support for democracy and human rights. In an exploration of United States foreign policy toward Africa, Korwa G. Adar argued that the collapse of the Soviet Union ushered in great opportunity for the pursuit of foreign policy based on Wilsonianism. This foreign policy trend emerged within the United States' foreign policymaking establishment in favor of the pursuit of democracy and human rights policy in Africa during decolonization and independence struggles. While these principles surfaced periodically throughout both Republican and Democratic administrations, the spirit of Wilsonianism gave way to cold war principles based on national interests and specifically on anti- communism. Alter a state visit to Africa from February 28 to March 21 1957, Wee-President Richard Nixon explained in his report to President Dwight D. Eisenhower that, ""the course of Africa's development could well prove to be the decisive factor between the forces of freedom and intemational communism?"" The linkage of Wilsonianism to foreign policy and development acquired a central theme during the height of the cold war under Ronald Reagan administration as well as under President George H. Bush following the collapse of the Soviet Union, The former United States advisor to the United Nations Commission for Human Rights, Marc Northem, interjected, at least rhetorically, that Wilsonian principles were an important part ofthe Bush administration's foreign policy and its promotion of democracy and human rights. In his address to the Human Rights Commission, Northem stated that, ""the US makes no apology for insisting that where human rights are concerned, every nation, including my own must be held to the highest standard. We stand ready to help those governments committed to human rights move ahead,"""" He further emphasized that, ""the division in the world today is not bctwccn East and West. The real division in the world is between those committed to democracy and liberty and those against."""" This rhetorical interjection of Wilsonian democratic principles did not, however, manifest in any significant way until the 1990s. In 1989 the George H. Bush administration initially was opposed to cutting foreign aid to some of the leading African old guards-cum-dictators such as arap Moi (Kenya), Siad Barre (Somalia), and Mobutu Sese Seko (Zaire, now Democratic Republic ofthe Congo). Later, however, the same dictators, including arap Moi, were to face political conditionalities as part of the World Bank and Intemational Monetary Fund's promotion of structural adjustment programs in the late 1980s and in the 1990s. The United States and other donor countries strongly supported the imposition of these conditionalities in Africa and, in fact, the principles were known as the ""Washington Consensus."" Kenya's relationship with the United States and other donor countries in general began to deteriorate in 1989. The years 1989-91 witnessed great intemal and intemational pressure on the~Kenyan Govemment to allow multipartism. The then United States ambassador to Kenya, Hempstone Smith, brushing diplomatic ethics aside, stated publicly that United States assistance would be directed to countries that ""nourished democratic institutions, defended human rights and practiced multiparty politics.""""""˜ In conformity with Section 116 of the 1961 Foreign Assistance Act, which prohibited support for regimes that flaunted democratic and human rights principles, as well as other democracy and human rights legislation, George H. Bush acquiesced to the Congressional freezing of US$25 million in military aid to Kenya."" Kenya's foreign aid was subsequently withheld by the United States and other donors in 1991, forcing the arap Moi regime to allow multipartism, but it was not until 2002, some 24 years after gaining power, that Kenya swore in a new president. Kenya's Foreign Policy under the Kibaki Presidency The United States was interested in seeing Kenya succeed in consolidating democratic change and revitalizing its economy, both of which would serve longstanding interests in democracy and human rights as well as the strategic and security concerns. During the cold war, President arap Moi was a staunch anti- communist ally of the United States, and in the ""war on terror"" context, Kenya once again emerged as a reliable ally, and as a key African strategic partner in George W. Bush's September 2002 National Security Strategy. As one of the more ""stable"" countries in the Horn of Africa, Kenya was an important regional partner in the United States sub-regional command in neighboring Djibouti where a large Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) contingent and 1,000 United States troops were stationed to counteract terrorist cells believed to be operating in Somalia and Yemen; to prevent al-Qaeda operatives from lieeing to the Hom of Ah'ica; and protect commercial and military sea lanes, especially from piracy in the Gulf of Aden. After 9/ l 1 , the Bush administration renewed airbase, port access, and over- Bight agreements with the Kenyan government, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld traveled to the region in early December 2002 to make a case for stronger security cooperation. Of the $20 million in supplemental funds authorized by the United States Congress in October 2002 to strengthen counterterrorist security in Africa, $15 million was earmarked for Kenya. This attested to United States recognition not only of Kenya's regional importance but also to the country's acute vulnerability as a soft target and conduit for terrorist activities. Kenya has served, and will likely serve again, as an important humanitarian platfonn for United States assistance going to southern Sudan, Somalia, the Great Lakes region, and Ethiopia and Eritrea. The role of Kenya as an ally goes beyond the single issue of counterterrorism. For more than a decade, Operation Lifeline Sudan has been a vital conduit of humanitarian relief to southern Sudan from its base in Turkana District."" Kenya also provided a haven to thousands of Somali refugees. In his last year in office, Moi played an important role in efforts to end the civil war in Sudan, building on the peace initiatives of former United States Senator John Danforth. This initiative led to the Machakos Protocol on the issue of self-determination for southern Sudan. The United States has a large presence in Kenya, including its embassy and the United States Agency for Intemational Development (USAID) mission, which are among the largest in Africa. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has made an exceptional investment in public health in Kenya, particularly to combat HIV/AIDS and malaria. As a result of default foreign policy based on terrorism and United States involvement, Muslim communities in Coast Province were offended by what they perceived to be heavy-handed investigations by both the Kenyan security forces and the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The Mombasa bombing in 2002 did not evoke a similar response, partly because the number of casualties was much lower, but also because Kenya's domestic attention was focused on the election. It is likely, however, that the al-Qaeda attack in Mombasa, like that in Bali earlier in 2002, was intended in part to chill Kenyan enthusiasm for continued partnership with the United States and to demonstrate al-Qaeda's ability to strike in the Hom of Africa, despite the United States' expanding security engagement. The United States' expanded militarization of the sub-region corresponded with a growing sense of vulnerability among Kenyans, which is likely to persist as long as the United States remains in the region and deepen its security cooperation with Kenya. For domestic politicians there is reason to fear the electoral consequences of deepening security cooperation in the ""war on terror,"" as Kenyan grow weary of being placed in the frontline of the war against terrorism, and worried about the prospects for another catastrophe of the proportions of the embassy bombings or worse. Kenyans, particularly along the Coast and Northe&tern Provinces also had reservation about being drawn into a coniiict which entailed eradicating Al-Ittihad in Somalia and sowing future seeds for interregional and religious conliicts among neighboring countries,.",summarize the following text: ,"then President arap Moi granted it the right to use the Mombasa port as a supply and recreational base These alliances were strengthened on military and security front after 9/11 if the country did not have these military facilities Washington would certainly be less concerned about the terrorist threats it was facing. its foreign policy in the region has been a lightning rod for terrorist aggression in Kenya, terrorists are now more likely than at any point to obtain and use w m d inadequate attention has been paid to what motivates terrorists to launch attacks in the first place a strong correlation exists between the perception, of U S foreign policy and an increase in terrorist attacks the Defense Science Board noted a relationship between an activist American foreign policy and terrorism America's role as reluctant imperialist or global cop invites resistance a much more effective way to protect America might be to adopt a more restrained foreign policy.

"It’s so definite that both al Qaeda and ISIS are US made allies, be it fighting Russians in the graveyard of empires of Afghanistan (back in the 1980’s when Reagan and Bush senior created the Mujahedeen-turned-al Qaeda), the balkanizing of Yugoslavia against Serbs in the 1990’s, and Osama and his 15 fellow Saudi stooges of the supposed 19 box-cutting terrorist role actors hired by the Bush-Cheney neocons for the inside 9/11 job. And to this day al Qaeda/ISIS has been employed as the hired gun to create havoc in order to destabilize everywhere the US unleashes it, in effect to “balkanize” Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Each of the so called Muslim enemies of twenty-first century America – al Qaeda and ISIS – so bent on destroying Americans and the Western world because of our coveted freedoms (a laughable, not even funny joke of a lie) have been proven beyond question or doubt to be mere creations of the international crime syndicate posing as the axis of evil national governments – Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Of course this monstrous fiasco could never have been pulled off without the broader support coming from the likes of the European Union, NATO and other such “good friends” from the Middle East as Turkey, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait that along with the usual evil axis culprits have all financially backed international terrorism and the US Empire’s “war on terror” abomination. Numerous sources back up the fact that US and its allies created, funded, armed, trained and continue supplying and supporting ISIS. One such assertion comes from retired General Wesley Clark who back in 2007 also dropped the bombshell revealing the infamous neocon agenda to take down seven sovereign nations in five years, a plan devised even prior to 9/11. The neocon architects of US foreign policy have a habit of “accidentally on purpose” giving away free arms to America’s supposed enemy. It began with all the light and heavy weapons that accidentally fell into Islamic State’s hands fighting as US proxy war mercenaries against Syria’s Assad. A short time after that heist, last June the Iraqi army abandoned its post to defend Mosul and handed over 2300 more Humvees, more than 50 American made howitzers, a cool half billion in stolen money from Mosul banks making it the richest terrorist group in the world and claiming the bounteous prize of Iraq’s second largest city 249 miles from Baghdad. Then there was last month’s cut and run rerun by those same Iraqi security forces in another mass giveaway in western Iraq’s largest city Ramadi. The Pentagon admits that at least a half dozen tanks and another 100 Humvees were left there for jihadists to claim. And now as if this pattern isn’t disastrous enough, Washington has approved another order to replenish those lost Humvees with another 1000 along with another 175 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Iraq. What better way for the arms industry to keep getting richer while simultaneously guaranteeing the war on terror continues on forever. Just keep losing stockpiles of US made weapons to the fake enemy and then keep selling more to the Iraqis who keep handing it over to ISIS. War is a racket! And then there’s the latest jewel of an Iraq city falling victim to the unstoppable ISIS “enemy.” Palmyra was lost and now in the midst of having all its ancient architectural treasures destroyed. If ISIS wasn’t the neocons’ actual friend, this really would be one big batch of bad news. A latest claim by US Embassy Syria maintains that Assad’s government forces have teamed up with the Islamic State in Syria. After five years of failing to remove the Assad regime, this is likely to be America’s latest false flag strategy by having moderate US backed anti-Syrian rebels come forth to claim that Assad has secretly been in cahoots helping ISIS for the last two years. This would easily provide all the justification the US would need to step up its offensive in Syria, of course not against ISIS but Assad. This follows on the heels of a highly embarrassing recently released declassified August 2012 document that indicates that the US Pentagon and State Department three years ago identified ISIS as a strategic ally in the wars in both Iraq and Syria. This same document further exposes Hilary Clinton and Obama’s illicit gun running operation using Ambassador Christopher Stevens to oversee the arms shipment from the Benghazi port to Syria. Funny how no sooner does one US lie lead to the next, and the next. The Benghazi cover-up as the lie that won’t go away once again rearing its ugly head causes the “ISIS is a US enemy lie” to get uncovered and then another probable lie suddenly is being promoted as the latest wag the dog whopper designed to not only take the heat off the latest outed deceptions but provide the needed cover for US boots on the ground in both Iraq and Syria. This administration only knows one response when past lies get revealed, engage in yet more deceitful tactics that in this case is a desperado ploy to up the ante against Assad. Then two and a half months ago there was the half billion dollars’ worth of unaccountable war weaponry gifted the overthrown Yemen puppet government that went to the overthrowers the Shiite Houthis. Then two months ago came more demoralizing news indicating that 5,000 new ISIS recruits were converging on Yemen to fight in the latest war flaring up in the volatile region. The UN report disclosed that 25,000 recruits from most nations around the world have been rushing to the Middle East in droves to sign up with the Islamic State just since last June. The US created terrorist Frankenstein monster appears to only be growing stronger and like a cancer spreading its violent control over a wider expanse of land mass and nations, even spotted training eight miles from the US border in Mexico. This set off a firestorm of speculation that with the upcoming Jade Helm 15 Special Forces exercises scheduled for 10 weeks this summer, the stage may apparently be set for a potential false flag attack by ISIS so that the largest military operation on US soil in history can conveniently go live and dictator Obama can have his martial law. This “oops” pattern of unwittingly helping America’s enemy just keeps recurring indefinitely. Over and over again the US has been caught red-handed creating and using the proxy services of mercenary allies doubling as the US fake enemies. Or repeatedly being busted supplying airdrops of weapons, food and medical supplies to the waiting Islamic jihadists on the ground with the common excuse it was meant for the Kurds or Iraqi forces. The nine months of so called air campaign to root the Islamic State out of Iraq and Syria have only resulted in strengthening the so called enemy. Instead of bombing the IS jihadists, both Israeli and American jets have targeted Syria’s infrastructure like oil refineries, pipelines and storage grain silos that hurt the Syrian people. Instead of actually striking ISIS as the supposed target in Syria, the US has given ISIS air support aimed to defeat Assad forces. Since Obama’s so called declaration of war against the Islamic State last September, ISIS has only grown in strength, numbers and taken control over more territory in both Iraq, Syria, Libya and now Yemen than ever before, exposing the façade of the US led air coalition as yet another US led deception. Meanwhile, warmongering Senator John McCain has met regularly with his ISIS buddies, even taking time out of his busy schedule for an all smiles photo-op session. The same with Israeli war criminal Netanyahu making the rounds with bedside visits to hospitalized al Qaeda terrorists in Golan Heights. Ever wonder why al Qaeda/ISIS never attack Israel? Why bite the hand that feeds you? The extreme degree of deceit and hypocrisy that the US and Israel exhibit as the two biggest supporters of state sponsored terrorism is obscene. Though the US military is notorious for its lack of accountability especially in Iraq and Afghanistan (without even an audit since last century), the Pentagon cannot continue attempting to pretend to constantly lose all its wars without diabolical intention, or giving away years of war-making materials to the alleged enemies with all those purposely designed handouts. It was reported last year that the Pentagon’s grossly wasteful, antiquated system lost over $1 billion worth of ammunition. Despite the General Accounting Office tasked since 1997 with annual audits of the federal government, the Pentagon is always the sole exception as its archaic record keeping methods have failed to produce any accurate accounting. It’s all too obvious that the military’s thinly veiled, chronic excuse of purported incompetence is its sinister way to guarantee continued unaccountability and a forever “war on terror” in the Middle East and North Africa (and now largely under the radar spreading wildly into sub-Saharan Africa with lower intensity dirty secret wars) only continues uninterrupted globally for decades to come. The oligarch owned and controlled Obama-EU-NATO regime has made it clear that as the power shift moves from their absolute dominance to the rising oligarch giants from the East, movement towards rapid geopolitical destabilization and world war is on the near horizon. Using Ukraine as its preposterous excuse to demonize Putin for merely responding to US Empire aggression and threat by simply protecting fellow ethnic Russians in Crimea who voted to be annexed and Putin’s own strategic naval base in Crimea, from the beginning the US had no moral ground whatsoever to hypocritically stand in judgment since it was responsible for unlawfully overthrowing a democratically elected leader from a supposed sovereign nation. Then when more ethnic Russians residing in eastern Ukraine wanted independence from the corrupt, neo-Nazi US puppet regime in Kiev, more false accusations flew trying to blame Putin for the downing of the Malaysian Airliner flight MH 17 when in fact it was destroyed by Ukrainian missiles fired by jets from Kiev. More incessant lies about Putin invading Ukraine clearly showed the world who the real villain is. The NATO commander US General Breedlove’s repeatedly insane charges only embarrassed the US and alienated European nations like Germany that began questioning US Empire’s reckless push for war in their backyard with nuclear powered Russia. Despite the ongoing Minsk peace talks this year brokered by German and French leaders with Putin and Kiev, Obama insists on sending heavy weaponry including 50 Abrams tanks cto ensure that war in Ukraine will not only continue but escalates into greater carnage. All as a prelude excuse for war directly with Russia. Aggressive currency and cyber wars in addition to aggressive military posturing resulting in mounting regional territorial conflict in the South China Sea currently ramping up in Pacific Asia have also been adding fuel to the flames of potential war against China. US is pressuring Australia to enter the cold war against China by engaging in joint military training. Meanwhile, armies from nations around the world have been increasingly involved in West versus East joint training exercises in every corner of the globe, from the Arctic to Africa to Asia in preparation for inevitable global war. The US warmongering has been responsible for ratcheting up an international arms race as both Russia and Chinaare spending billions more than they used to on their military and both are also competing now against the US as the world’s largest arms peddler. Clearly the oligarchs have deployed and misused the US military as the most lethal destructive force around the globe propping up a crumbling US Empire and its weakening superpower status in rapid hegemonic decline. And after two costly (six trillion and rising) decade plus war defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan both by design, an overburdened tax base and decimated, shrinking middle class, the puppet masters have willfully and diabolically gutted America’s manufacturing base and aging, decaying infrastructure. Only the globalists profit from war, not people or nations. Obama has been the ideal Manchurian Candidate president for his globalist handlers, deceitfully conning and betraying the people who foolishly voted him twice into office only to have him usher in the present New World Order and the militarization of the US police state. Not only does war continue in Iraq and Afghanistan, it also rages on out of control in Syria, Libya, Yemen and Ukraine. But now the counterinsurgency wars practiced by US military around the world have come home to roost against the American people. Using the lie of “national security” to impose abusive authoritarian control that has obliterated the US constitution, since 9/11 draconian laws have proliferated throughout Western nations. Citizens in a growing number of Western countries are restricted on how much cash they can withdraw from their own bank accounts without banks ratting them out to the feds. This of course is how the globalists eventually manipulate towards a cashless society on their way to a one world government and currency soon replaced by microchips. Even more alarming is the legislation inCanada, Cyprus, New Zealand, the US, the UK, and now Germany that permits banks in emergencies to freeze and even seize all customers’ assets. The next economic crisis will be the next bail out and sadly people stand to lose their life savings. Other NWO restrictions punishable by law prohibit feeding the homeless in parks, collecting rainwater on your own private property, and growing your own food in a garden on your own property. A Florida court just ruled that living off the totalitarian grid is illegal. In some places homelessness is being criminalized. The increasingly absurd and oppressive state demands that its citizens be totally dependent on the bankrupt system and to this aim is now busily outlawing independence. In an era of pre-crime thought police and mind control a la the film “The Minority Report,” the power of the state becomes absolute over the collapsing power of the individual and free will. The war trained and militarized police state is currently warring with its own people, particularly if they are Americans of color, poor, war veterans, libertarians, civil liberties activists, First Amendment protesters, progressives, environmentalists, peace activists, constitutionalists, home schoolers, families, Tea Party activists, anti-abortionists, gun rights activists and owners, Christians, property rights activists, and paramilitary groups. The list is growing to pretty much include all Americans now viewed by the traitors in the federal government as enemies of the state and homegrown terrorists. The US crime cabal government has a long history of fabricating enemies so that the globalist military industrial complex Eisenhower warned us about five and a half decades ago could readily manufacture and justify nonstop war. From the prolonged but recently resurrected cold war against Russia and China together with their longtime allies North Korea and Cuba through the first decade long US war in Vietnam to this century’s longest running wars in US history in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Washington criminals in charge have deceptively used their winning formula for losing nonstop war after war simply by never running out of lies to conjure up demonized enemies that get repeated so much in the MSM echo chamber to convince a docile and dumbed down America into blaming conveniently designated scapegoat(s) for all the world’s ills. And now with government abuse out of control, the feds’ latest designated enemy are none other than fellow Americans. Like Bush junior once arrogantly stated, “You’re either with us or against us.” Using the old divide and conquer strategy together with the Hegelian dialectic to falsely create crises, the US crime cabal government then comes up with its already planned solution that ensures only greater tyrannical control. This methodology deceives the disempowered robotic nation of America from waking up to the evil agenda and, as a result history continually repeats itself. But meanwhile, as nonstop victims of US Empire’s brutal global aggression and conquests by either military force and occupation or economic war and extortion, the rest of the subjugated, abused world as US victims have painfully known who the real devil of an enemy is on this planet – the (Dis)United States of Chaos and Destruction, otherwise known as the globalists’ USA – Usurp Sovereignty of All nations to enslave the entire planet in their New World Order. Whether under the dominion of Western oligarchs (aka the cabal belonging to the Rothschild’s, English/Euro-royalty, the Vatican, the Rockefellers and the Bush-Clinton crime dynasty) and their predatory central banking system enslaving the world or under the dominion of the emerging power partnership of the Chinese-Russian coalition racing to replace and defeat the sole world superpower of US Empire and its crumbling, valueless standard international fiat currency, make no mistake the powerbrokers on planet earth manipulating the global masses into disempowered impoverishment and death for centuries have numbered but a handful of the wealthiest families on the planet residing in the East as well as the West. The bottom line reality throughout human history is that power corrupts. Humans have simply never been able to evolve sufficiently to where their power structure promotes leaders made from an ilk that’s magnanimous, just, and spiritually motivated to help and uplift their fellow human beings. Instead Western oligarchs for eons have placed their servant politicians, corporate kings and dictators in power to do their evil bidding are by their very nature sub-human, criminal psychopaths who experience not even a shred of guilt, shame, remorse, regret or lost sleep over systematically slaughtering millions of other human beings. Since the globalists own virtually everything on the planet of any monetary value (in US top .1% owns as much as bottom 90% and by next year the top 1% globally will have more wealth than the bottom 99% of us), owning and controlling national governments, corporations, expansive luxury estates, status cars, boats and toys, valuable art and jewelry all become meaningless. With the thrill of accumulating wealth’s accoutrements long since outgrown and gone after building their wealth off the sweat, blood and labor of the common citizens they’ve always loathed in contempt and fear, the globalists only thrill left to enjoy (aside from their ritualistic acts of pedophilia and human sacrifice) is complete and total domination and control over every surviving human on earth. Hence with technology in recent times they’ve resorted to great lengths to dumb us all down through the numbing, stupefying elixir of various forms of hi-tech digital addiction within their prime arsenal of soft kill weapons of mass distraction. Unable to think critically or question authority or examine and learn the truth amidst the elite’s carefully controlled weapon of propaganda lies and disinformation, imposing mind control techniques through mass media effects breeds a robotic brainwashed passivity into the zombified masses that have become incapable of or unwilling to recognize the ruling class’ theft and plunder, rendering them powerless to fight back. Lulled into a delusional, delirious state of perpetual, intergenerational slumber, it seems humans have reached critical mass. The human spirit has degenerated as the humanoid species has been literally and exhaustively beaten down so long it’s merely morphed into joining the ranks of the walking dead, their humanity sucked and bled dry by bloodthirsty elitist, psychopathic vampires.

"It’s so definite that both al Qaeda and ISIS are US made allies, be it fighting Russians in the graveyard of empires of Afghanistan (back in the 1980’s when Reagan and Bush senior created the Mujahedeen-turned-al Qaeda), the balkanizing of Yugoslavia against Serbs in the 1990’s, and Osama and his 15 fellow Saudi stooges of the supposed 19 box-cutting terrorist role actors hired by the Bush-Cheney neocons for the inside 9/11 job. And to this day al Qaeda/ISIS has been employed as the hired gun to create havoc in order to destabilize everywhere the US unleashes it, in effect to “balkanize” Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Each of the so called Muslim enemies of twenty-first century America – al Qaeda and ISIS – so bent on destroying Americans and the Western world because of our coveted freedoms (a laughable, not even funny joke of a lie) have been proven beyond question or doubt to be mere creations of the international crime syndicate posing as the axis of evil national governments – Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Of course this monstrous fiasco could never have been pulled off without the broader support coming from the likes of the European Union, NATO and other such “good friends” from the Middle East as Turkey, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait that along with the usual evil axis culprits have all financially backed international terrorism and the US Empire’s “war on terror” abomination. Numerous sources back up the fact that US and its allies created, funded, armed, trained and continue supplying and supporting ISIS. One such assertion comes from retired General Wesley Clark who back in 2007 also dropped the bombshell revealing the infamous neocon agenda to take down seven sovereign nations in five years, a plan devised even prior to 9/11. The neocon architects of US foreign policy have a habit of “accidentally on purpose” giving away free arms to America’s supposed enemy. It began with all the light and heavy weapons that accidentally fell into Islamic State’s hands fighting as US proxy war mercenaries against Syria’s Assad. A short time after that heist, last June the Iraqi army abandoned its post to defend Mosul and handed over 2300 more Humvees, more than 50 American made howitzers, a cool half billion in stolen money from Mosul banks making it the richest terrorist group in the world and claiming the bounteous prize of Iraq’s second largest city 249 miles from Baghdad. Then there was last month’s cut and run rerun by those same Iraqi security forces in another mass giveaway in western Iraq’s largest city Ramadi. The Pentagon admits that at least a half dozen tanks and another 100 Humvees were left there for jihadists to claim. And now as if this pattern isn’t disastrous enough, Washington has approved another order to replenish those lost Humvees with another 1000 along with another 175 M1A1 Abrams tanks to Iraq. What better way for the arms industry to keep getting richer while simultaneously guaranteeing the war on terror continues on forever. Just keep losing stockpiles of US made weapons to the fake enemy and then keep selling more to the Iraqis who keep handing it over to ISIS. War is a racket! And then there’s the latest jewel of an Iraq city falling victim to the unstoppable ISIS “enemy.” Palmyra was lost and now in the midst of having all its ancient architectural treasures destroyed. If ISIS wasn’t the neocons’ actual friend, this really would be one big batch of bad news. A latest claim by US Embassy Syria maintains that Assad’s government forces have teamed up with the Islamic State in Syria. After five years of failing to remove the Assad regime, this is likely to be America’s latest false flag strategy by having moderate US backed anti-Syrian rebels come forth to claim that Assad has secretly been in cahoots helping ISIS for the last two years. This would easily provide all the justification the US would need to step up its offensive in Syria, of course not against ISIS but Assad. This follows on the heels of a highly embarrassing recently released declassified August 2012 document that indicates that the US Pentagon and State Department three years ago identified ISIS as a strategic ally in the wars in both Iraq and Syria. This same document further exposes Hilary Clinton and Obama’s illicit gun running operation using Ambassador Christopher Stevens to oversee the arms shipment from the Benghazi port to Syria. Funny how no sooner does one US lie lead to the next, and the next. The Benghazi cover-up as the lie that won’t go away once again rearing its ugly head causes the “ISIS is a US enemy lie” to get uncovered and then another probable lie suddenly is being promoted as the latest wag the dog whopper designed to not only take the heat off the latest outed deceptions but provide the needed cover for US boots on the ground in both Iraq and Syria. This administration only knows one response when past lies get revealed, engage in yet more deceitful tactics that in this case is a desperado ploy to up the ante against Assad. Then two and a half months ago there was the half billion dollars’ worth of unaccountable war weaponry gifted the overthrown Yemen puppet government that went to the overthrowers the Shiite Houthis. Then two months ago came more demoralizing news indicating that 5,000 new ISIS recruits were converging on Yemen to fight in the latest war flaring up in the volatile region. The UN report disclosed that 25,000 recruits from most nations around the world have been rushing to the Middle East in droves to sign up with the Islamic State just since last June. The US created terrorist Frankenstein monster appears to only be growing stronger and like a cancer spreading its violent control over a wider expanse of land mass and nations, even spotted training eight miles from the US border in Mexico. This set off a firestorm of speculation that with the upcoming Jade Helm 15 Special Forces exercises scheduled for 10 weeks this summer, the stage may apparently be set for a potential false flag attack by ISIS so that the largest military operation on US soil in history can conveniently go live and dictator Obama can have his martial law. This “oops” pattern of unwittingly helping America’s enemy just keeps recurring indefinitely. Over and over again the US has been caught red-handed creating and using the proxy services of mercenary allies doubling as the US fake enemies. Or repeatedly being busted supplying airdrops of weapons, food and medical supplies to the waiting Islamic jihadists on the ground with the common excuse it was meant for the Kurds or Iraqi forces. The nine months of so called air campaign to root the Islamic State out of Iraq and Syria have only resulted in strengthening the so called enemy. Instead of bombing the IS jihadists, both Israeli and American jets have targeted Syria’s infrastructure like oil refineries, pipelines and storage grain silos that hurt the Syrian people. Instead of actually striking ISIS as the supposed target in Syria, the US has given ISIS air support aimed to defeat Assad forces. Since Obama’s so called declaration of war against the Islamic State last September, ISIS has only grown in strength, numbers and taken control over more territory in both Iraq, Syria, Libya and now Yemen than ever before, exposing the façade of the US led air coalition as yet another US led deception. Meanwhile, warmongering Senator John McCain has met regularly with his ISIS buddies, even taking time out of his busy schedule for an all smiles photo-op session. The same with Israeli war criminal Netanyahu making the rounds with bedside visits to hospitalized al Qaeda terrorists in Golan Heights. Ever wonder why al Qaeda/ISIS never attack Israel? Why bite the hand that feeds you? The extreme degree of deceit and hypocrisy that the US and Israel exhibit as the two biggest supporters of state sponsored terrorism is obscene. Though the US military is notorious for its lack of accountability especially in Iraq and Afghanistan (without even an audit since last century), the Pentagon cannot continue attempting to pretend to constantly lose all its wars without diabolical intention, or giving away years of war-making materials to the alleged enemies with all those purposely designed handouts. It was reported last year that the Pentagon’s grossly wasteful, antiquated system lost over $1 billion worth of ammunition. Despite the General Accounting Office tasked since 1997 with annual audits of the federal government, the Pentagon is always the sole exception as its archaic record keeping methods have failed to produce any accurate accounting. It’s all too obvious that the military’s thinly veiled, chronic excuse of purported incompetence is its sinister way to guarantee continued unaccountability and a forever “war on terror” in the Middle East and North Africa (and now largely under the radar spreading wildly into sub-Saharan Africa with lower intensity dirty secret wars) only continues uninterrupted globally for decades to come. The oligarch owned and controlled Obama-EU-NATO regime has made it clear that as the power shift moves from their absolute dominance to the rising oligarch giants from the East, movement towards rapid geopolitical destabilization and world war is on the near horizon. Using Ukraine as its preposterous excuse to demonize Putin for merely responding to US Empire aggression and threat by simply protecting fellow ethnic Russians in Crimea who voted to be annexed and Putin’s own strategic naval base in Crimea, from the beginning the US had no moral ground whatsoever to hypocritically stand in judgment since it was responsible for unlawfully overthrowing a democratically elected leader from a supposed sovereign nation. Then when more ethnic Russians residing in eastern Ukraine wanted independence from the corrupt, neo-Nazi US puppet regime in Kiev, more false accusations flew trying to blame Putin for the downing of the Malaysian Airliner flight MH 17 when in fact it was destroyed by Ukrainian missiles fired by jets from Kiev. More incessant lies about Putin invading Ukraine clearly showed the world who the real villain is. The NATO commander US General Breedlove’s repeatedly insane charges only embarrassed the US and alienated European nations like Germany that began questioning US Empire’s reckless push for war in their backyard with nuclear powered Russia. Despite the ongoing Minsk peace talks this year brokered by German and French leaders with Putin and Kiev, Obama insists on sending heavy weaponry including 50 Abrams tanks cto ensure that war in Ukraine will not only continue but escalates into greater carnage. All as a prelude excuse for war directly with Russia. Aggressive currency and cyber wars in addition to aggressive military posturing resulting in mounting regional territorial conflict in the South China Sea currently ramping up in Pacific Asia have also been adding fuel to the flames of potential war against China. US is pressuring Australia to enter the cold war against China by engaging in joint military training. Meanwhile, armies from nations around the world have been increasingly involved in West versus East joint training exercises in every corner of the globe, from the Arctic to Africa to Asia in preparation for inevitable global war. The US warmongering has been responsible for ratcheting up an international arms race as both Russia and Chinaare spending billions more than they used to on their military and both are also competing now against the US as the world’s largest arms peddler. Clearly the oligarchs have deployed and misused the US military as the most lethal destructive force around the globe propping up a crumbling US Empire and its weakening superpower status in rapid hegemonic decline. And after two costly (six trillion and rising) decade plus war defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan both by design, an overburdened tax base and decimated, shrinking middle class, the puppet masters have willfully and diabolically gutted America’s manufacturing base and aging, decaying infrastructure. Only the globalists profit from war, not people or nations. Obama has been the ideal Manchurian Candidate president for his globalist handlers, deceitfully conning and betraying the people who foolishly voted him twice into office only to have him usher in the present New World Order and the militarization of the US police state. Not only does war continue in Iraq and Afghanistan, it also rages on out of control in Syria, Libya, Yemen and Ukraine. But now the counterinsurgency wars practiced by US military around the world have come home to roost against the American people. Using the lie of “national security” to impose abusive authoritarian control that has obliterated the US constitution, since 9/11 draconian laws have proliferated throughout Western nations. Citizens in a growing number of Western countries are restricted on how much cash they can withdraw from their own bank accounts without banks ratting them out to the feds. This of course is how the globalists eventually manipulate towards a cashless society on their way to a one world government and currency soon replaced by microchips. Even more alarming is the legislation inCanada, Cyprus, New Zealand, the US, the UK, and now Germany that permits banks in emergencies to freeze and even seize all customers’ assets. The next economic crisis will be the next bail out and sadly people stand to lose their life savings. Other NWO restrictions punishable by law prohibit feeding the homeless in parks, collecting rainwater on your own private property, and growing your own food in a garden on your own property. A Florida court just ruled that living off the totalitarian grid is illegal. In some places homelessness is being criminalized. The increasingly absurd and oppressive state demands that its citizens be totally dependent on the bankrupt system and to this aim is now busily outlawing independence. In an era of pre-crime thought police and mind control a la the film “The Minority Report,” the power of the state becomes absolute over the collapsing power of the individual and free will. The war trained and militarized police state is currently warring with its own people, particularly if they are Americans of color, poor, war veterans, libertarians, civil liberties activists, First Amendment protesters, progressives, environmentalists, peace activists, constitutionalists, home schoolers, families, Tea Party activists, anti-abortionists, gun rights activists and owners, Christians, property rights activists, and paramilitary groups. The list is growing to pretty much include all Americans now viewed by the traitors in the federal government as enemies of the state and homegrown terrorists. The US crime cabal government has a long history of fabricating enemies so that the globalist military industrial complex Eisenhower warned us about five and a half decades ago could readily manufacture and justify nonstop war. From the prolonged but recently resurrected cold war against Russia and China together with their longtime allies North Korea and Cuba through the first decade long US war in Vietnam to this century’s longest running wars in US history in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Washington criminals in charge have deceptively used their winning formula for losing nonstop war after war simply by never running out of lies to conjure up demonized enemies that get repeated so much in the MSM echo chamber to convince a docile and dumbed down America into blaming conveniently designated scapegoat(s) for all the world’s ills. And now with government abuse out of control, the feds’ latest designated enemy are none other than fellow Americans. Like Bush junior once arrogantly stated, “You’re either with us or against us.” Using the old divide and conquer strategy together with the Hegelian dialectic to falsely create crises, the US crime cabal government then comes up with its already planned solution that ensures only greater tyrannical control. This methodology deceives the disempowered robotic nation of America from waking up to the evil agenda and, as a result history continually repeats itself. But meanwhile, as nonstop victims of US Empire’s brutal global aggression and conquests by either military force and occupation or economic war and extortion, the rest of the subjugated, abused world as US victims have painfully known who the real devil of an enemy is on this planet – the (Dis)United States of Chaos and Destruction, otherwise known as the globalists’ USA – Usurp Sovereignty of All nations to enslave the entire planet in their New World Order. Whether under the dominion of Western oligarchs (aka the cabal belonging to the Rothschild’s, English/Euro-royalty, the Vatican, the Rockefellers and the Bush-Clinton crime dynasty) and their predatory central banking system enslaving the world or under the dominion of the emerging power partnership of the Chinese-Russian coalition racing to replace and defeat the sole world superpower of US Empire and its crumbling, valueless standard international fiat currency, make no mistake the powerbrokers on planet earth manipulating the global masses into disempowered impoverishment and death for centuries have numbered but a handful of the wealthiest families on the planet residing in the East as well as the West.

Since the globalists own virtually everything on the planet of any monetary value (in US top .1% owns as much as bottom 90% and by next year the top 1% globally will have more wealth than the bottom 99% of us), owning and controlling national governments, corporations, expansive luxury estates, status cars, boats and toys, valuable art and jewelry all become meaningless.

"It’s so definite that both al Qaeda and ISIS are US made allies, be it fighting Russians in the graveyard of empires of Afghanistan (back in the 1980’s when Reagan and Bush senior created the Mujahedeen-turned-al Qaeda), the balkanizing of Yugoslavia against Serbs in the 1990’s, and Osama and his 15 fellow Saudi stooges of the supposed 19 box-cutting terrorist role actors hired by the Bush-Cheney neocons for the inside 9/11 job.

Since Obama’s so called declaration of war against the Islamic State last September, ISIS has only grown in strength, numbers and taken control over more territory in both Iraq, Syria, Libya and now Yemen than ever before, exposing the façade of the US led air coalition as yet another US led deception. Meanwhile, warmongering Senator John McCain has met regularly with his ISIS buddies, even taking time out of his busy schedule for an all smiles photo-op session. The same with Israeli war criminal Netanyahu making the rounds with bedside visits to hospitalized al Qaeda terrorists in Golan Heights. Ever wonder why al Qaeda/ISIS never attack Israel? Why bite the hand that feeds you? The extreme degree of deceit and hypocrisy that the US and Israel exhibit as the two biggest supporters of state sponsored terrorism is obscene. Though the US military is notorious for its lack of accountability especially in Iraq and Afghanistan (without even an audit since last century), the Pentagon cannot continue attempting to pretend to constantly lose all its wars without diabolical intention, or giving away years of war-making materials to the alleged enemies with all those purposely designed handouts. It was reported last year that the Pentagon’s grossly wasteful, antiquated system lost over $1 billion worth of ammunition. Despite the General Accounting Office tasked since 1997 with annual audits of the federal government, the Pentagon is always the sole exception as its archaic record keeping methods have failed to produce any accurate accounting. It’s all too obvious that the military’s thinly veiled, chronic excuse of purported incompetence is its sinister way to guarantee continued unaccountability and a forever “war on terror” in the Middle East and North Africa (and now largely under the radar spreading wildly into sub-Saharan Africa with lower intensity dirty secret wars) only continues uninterrupted globally for decades to come. The oligarch owned and controlled Obama-EU-NATO regime has made it clear that as the power shift moves from their absolute dominance to the rising oligarch giants from the East, movement towards rapid geopolitical destabilization and world war is on the near horizon. Using Ukraine as its preposterous excuse to demonize Putin for merely responding to US Empire aggression and threat by simply protecting fellow ethnic Russians in Crimea who voted to be annexed and Putin’s own strategic naval base in Crimea, from the beginning the US had no moral ground whatsoever to hypocritically stand in judgment since it was responsible for unlawfully overthrowing a democratically elected leader from a supposed sovereign nation. Then when more ethnic Russians residing in eastern Ukraine wanted independence from the corrupt, neo-Nazi US puppet regime in Kiev, more false accusations flew trying to blame Putin for the downing of the Malaysian Airliner flight MH 17 when in fact it was destroyed by Ukrainian missiles fired by jets from Kiev. More incessant lies about Putin invading Ukraine clearly showed the world who the real villain is. The NATO commander US General Breedlove’s repeatedly insane charges only embarrassed the US and alienated European nations like Germany that began questioning US Empire’s reckless push for war in their backyard with nuclear powered Russia. Despite the ongoing Minsk peace talks this year brokered by German and French leaders with Putin and Kiev, Obama insists on sending heavy weaponry including 50 Abrams tanks cto ensure that war in Ukraine will not only continue but escalates into greater carnage. All as a prelude excuse for war directly with Russia. Aggressive currency and cyber wars in addition to aggressive military posturing resulting in mounting regional territorial conflict in the South China Sea currently ramping up in Pacific Asia have also been adding fuel to the flames of potential war against China. US is pressuring Australia to enter the cold war against China by engaging in joint military training. Meanwhile, armies from nations around the world have been increasingly involved in West versus East joint training exercises in every corner of the globe, from the Arctic to Africa to Asia in preparation for inevitable global war. The US warmongering has been responsible for ratcheting up an international arms race as both Russia and Chinaare spending billions more than they used to on their military and both are also competing now against the US as the world’s largest arms peddler. Clearly the oligarchs have deployed and misused the US military as the most lethal destructive force around the globe propping up a crumbling US Empire and its weakening superpower status in rapid hegemonic decline. And after two costly (six trillion and rising) decade plus war defeats in Iraq and Afghanistan both by design, an overburdened tax base and decimated, shrinking middle class, the puppet masters have willfully and diabolically gutted America’s manufacturing base and aging, decaying infrastructure. Only the globalists profit from war, not people or nations. Obama has been the ideal Manchurian Candidate president for his globalist handlers, deceitfully conning and betraying the people who foolishly voted him twice into office only to have him usher in the present New World Order and the militarization of the US police state. Not only does war continue in Iraq and Afghanistan, it also rages on out of control in Syria, Libya, Yemen and Ukraine. But now the counterinsurgency wars practiced by US military around the world have come home to roost against the American people. Using the lie of “national security” to impose abusive authoritarian control that has obliterated the US constitution, since 9/11 draconian laws have proliferated throughout Western nations. Citizens in a growing number of Western countries are restricted on how much cash they can withdraw from their own bank accounts without banks ratting them out to the feds. This of course is how the globalists eventually manipulate towards a cashless society on their way to a one world government and currency soon replaced by microchips. Even more alarming is the legislation inCanada, Cyprus, New Zealand, the US, the UK, and now Germany that permits banks in emergencies to freeze and even seize all customers’ assets. The next economic crisis will be the next bail out and sadly people stand to lose their life savings. Other NWO restrictions punishable by law prohibit feeding the homeless in parks, collecting rainwater on your own private property, and growing your own food in a garden on your own property. A Florida court just ruled that living off the totalitarian grid is illegal. In some places homelessness is being criminalized. The increasingly absurd and oppressive state demands that its citizens be totally dependent on the bankrupt system and to this aim is now busily outlawing independence. In an era of pre-crime thought police and mind control a la the film “The Minority Report,” the power of the state becomes absolute over the collapsing power of the individual and free will. The war trained and militarized police state is currently warring with its own people, particularly if they are Americans of color, poor, war veterans, libertarians, civil liberties activists, First Amendment protesters, progressives, environmentalists, peace activists, constitutionalists, home schoolers, families, Tea Party activists, anti-abortionists, gun rights activists and owners, Christians, property rights activists, and paramilitary groups. The list is growing to pretty much include all Americans now viewed by the traitors in the federal government as enemies of the state and homegrown terrorists. The US crime cabal government has a long history of fabricating enemies so that the globalist military industrial complex Eisenhower warned us about five and a half decades ago could readily manufacture and justify nonstop war. From the prolonged but recently resurrected cold war against Russia and China together with their longtime allies North Korea and Cuba through the first decade long US war in Vietnam to this century’s longest running wars in US history in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Washington criminals in charge have deceptively used their winning formula for losing nonstop war after war simply by never running out of lies to conjure up demonized enemies that get repeated so much in the MSM echo chamber to convince a docile and dumbed down America into blaming conveniently designated scapegoat(s) for all the world’s ills. And now with government abuse out of control, the feds’ latest designated enemy are none other than fellow Americans. Like Bush junior once arrogantly stated, “You’re either with us or against us.” Using the old divide and conquer strategy together with the Hegelian dialectic to falsely create crises, the US crime cabal government then comes up with its already planned solution that ensures only greater tyrannical control. This methodology deceives the disempowered robotic nation of America from waking up to the evil agenda and, as a result history continually repeats itself. But meanwhile, as nonstop victims of US Empire’s brutal global aggression and conquests by either military force and occupation or economic war and extortion, the rest of the subjugated, abused world as US victims have painfully known who the real devil of an enemy is on this planet – the (Dis)United States of Chaos and Destruction, otherwise known as the globalists’ USA – Usurp Sovereignty of All nations to enslave the entire planet in their New World Order. Whether under the dominion of Western oligarchs (aka the cabal belonging to the Rothschild’s, English/Euro-royalty, the Vatican, the Rockefellers and the Bush-Clinton crime dynasty) and their predatory central banking system enslaving the world or under the dominion of the emerging power partnership of the Chinese-Russian coalition racing to replace and defeat the sole world superpower of US Empire and its crumbling, valueless standard international fiat currency, make no mistake the powerbrokers on planet earth manipulating the global masses into disempowered impoverishment and death for centuries have numbered but a handful of the wealthiest families on the planet residing in the East as well as the West. The bottom line reality throughout human history is that power corrupts. Humans have simply never been able to evolve sufficiently to where their power structure promotes leaders made from an ilk that’s magnanimous, just, and spiritually motivated to help and uplift their fellow human beings. Instead Western oligarchs for eons have placed their servant politicians, corporate kings and dictators in power to do their evil bidding are by their very nature sub-human, criminal psychopaths who experience not even a shred of guilt, shame, remorse, regret or lost sleep over systematically slaughtering millions of other human beings. Since the globalists own virtually everything on the planet of any monetary value (in US top .1% owns as much as bottom 90% and by next year the top 1% globally will have more wealth than the bottom 99% of us), owning and controlling national governments, corporations, expansive luxury estates, status cars, boats and toys, valuable art and jewelry all become meaningless. With the thrill of accumulating wealth’s accoutrements long since outgrown and gone after building their wealth off the sweat, blood and labor of the common citizens they’ve always loathed in contempt and fear, the globalists only thrill left to enjoy (aside from their ritualistic acts of pedophilia and human sacrifice) is complete and total domination and control over every surviving human on earth. Hence with technology in recent times they’ve resorted to great lengths to dumb us all down through the numbing, stupefying elixir of various forms of hi-tech digital addiction within their prime arsenal of soft kill weapons of mass distraction. Unable to think critically or question authority or examine and learn the truth amidst the elite’s carefully controlled weapon of propaganda lies and disinformation, imposing mind control techniques through mass media effects breeds a robotic brainwashed passivity into the zombified masses that have become incapable of or unwilling to recognize the ruling class’ theft and plunder, rendering them powerless to fight back. Lulled into a delusional, delirious state of perpetual, intergenerational slumber, it seems humans have reached critical mass. The human spirit has degenerated as the humanoid species has been literally and exhaustively beaten down so long it’s merely morphed into joining the ranks of the walking dead, their humanity sucked and bled dry by bloodthirsty elitist, psychopathic vampires. What will be left of this diminishing, thoroughly conquered, learned helpless human tribe, all half billion of them when human genocide is said and done, will only be continued subservience to their master.",summarize the following text: ,"ISIS has been employed as the hired gun to create havoc in order to destabilize everywhere the US unleashes it, in effect to “balkanize” Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen. retired General Wesley Clark who back in 2007 also dropped the bombshell revealing the infamous neocon agenda to take down seven sovereign nations in five years, a plan devised even prior to 9/11. The neocon architects of US foreign policy have a habit of “accidentally on purpose” giving away free arms to America’s supposed enemy. It began with all the light and heavy weapons that accidentally fell into Islamic State’s hands fighting as US proxy war mercenaries against Syria’s Assad. A short time after that heist, last June the Iraqi army abandoned its post to defend Mosul and handed over 2300 more Humvees, more than 50 American made howitzers, a cool half billion in stolen money from Mosul banks making it the richest terrorist group in the world and claiming the bounteous prize of Iraq’s second largest city 249 miles from Baghda The Pentagon admits that at least a half dozen tanks and another 100 Humvees were left there for jihadists to claim. What better way for the arms industry to keep getting richer while simultaneously guaranteeing the war on terror continues on forever. Just keep losing stockpiles of US made weapons to the fake enemy and then keep selling more to the Iraqis who keep handing it over to ISIS a highly embarrassing recently released declassified August 2012 document that indicates that the US Pentagon and State Department three years ago identified ISIS as a strategic ally in the wars in both Iraq and Syria. Over and over again the US has been busted supplying airdrops of weapons, food and medical supplies to the waiting Islamic jihadists on the ground with the common excuse it was meant for the Kurds or Iraqi forces The nine months air campaign have targeted Syria’s infrastructure like oil refineries to defeat Assad forces Since declaration of war last September, ISIS has only grown in strength, numbers and taken control over more territory .

"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"
"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32 Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government. There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort. To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then: South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000 North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000 South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies. However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action. In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious. North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible. The American Dimension These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below). Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil. Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies. The Nuclear Dimension Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33 Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional. As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment. On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario. The China Dimension How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity. However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38 Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40 Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government. China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula. A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash. For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45 The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang. But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces these scenarios could lead to a major conflict The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea with an eye toward securing weapons of mass destruction These goals would be most realistically achieved by overthrowing the North Korean government There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support this thinking is flawed.

"In the following sections, I argue that in the effort to avoid the risk of legal cooptation, the current wave of suggested alternatives produces a mirror result of practical and conceptual cooptation. Three central types of difficulties exist with contemporary extra-legal scholarship. First, in the former contexts of the labor movement and the civil rights era, arguments about legal cooptation often developed in response to a perceived gap between the conceptual ideal toward which a social reform group struggles and its actual implementation. Paradoxically, in the contemporary message of opting out of traditional legal reforms avenues, this problem is in fact accentuated. As the move to such concepts as informalization -- moving to non-legal strategies, civil society – moving to extra-legal spheres, and pluralism -- the proliferation of norm-generating actors, has been developed and appropriated by supporters from a wide range of political commitments, these concepts have had unintended implications that are in conflict with the very social reform ideals from which they stem. Second, the idea of opting-out of the legal arena becomes self-defeating as it conceals the on-going importance of law and the possibilities of law reform in seemingly unregulated spheres. A model of exit and rigid sphere distinctions further fails to recognize a reality of increasing interpenetration and blurring of boundaries between private and public spheres; profit and non-profit sectors; and formal and informal institutions. It therefore loses the critical insight that understands law as operating in the background of seemingly unregulated relationships. Finally, the romantic notion of a privileged sphere, mode and means of action fails to develop tools for evaluating its success. If the critique of legal cooptation has involved the argument that legal reform, even when viewed as a victory, is never radically transformative, we must ask what are the criteria for assessing the achievements of the suggested alternatives? As shall be illustrated in the following sections, much of the current scholarship obscures the lines between the descriptive and the prescriptive in its exploration and formulation of social activism. If current suggestions present themselves as an alternative to formal legal struggles, we must question whether the new extra-legal politics that are proposed and celebrated are capable of producing a constructive theory and meaningful channels for reform, rather than passive status quo politics. Practical Failures: When Extra-Legal Alternatives Are Vehicles For Conservative Agendas We don’t want the 1950s back. We want to edit them. We want to keep the safe streets, the friendly grocers, and the milk and cookies, while blotting out the political bosses, the tyrannical headmasters, the inflexible rules, and the lectures on 100% Americanism and the sinfulness of dissent.135 A basic structure of cooptation arguments as developed in relation to the labor and civil rights movements has been to show how in the move from theory to practice, the ideal that was promoted by a social group receives unintended content, thus failing to realize the original vision. This is particularly true when concepts are framed in broad terms that are open to multiple interpretations. The pitfalls of the range of risks presented under the umbrella of cooptation are in fact accentuated in current proposals. Paradoxically, current suggestions that are framed by way of opposition to formal law reform paths risk precisely such cooptative meanings. Extra-legal paths are depicted mostly in negative terms, as resorting to alternative forms of action than former models. Accordingly, because the ideas of organizing, civil society and legal pluralism are framed in open-ended contrarian terms, they do not translate into specific visions of social justice reform. The case of civil society, which has been embraced by people from a broad array of, and indeed often conflicting, ideological commitments, is particularly demonstrative. As Alan Wolfe has argued, “some ideas fail because they never make the light of day. The idea of civil society…failed because it became too popular.”136 In former eras, the claims about the legal cooptation of the transformative visions of workplace justice and racial equality was that through legal strategies the vision became stripped from the initial depth; fragmented and framed in ways that were narrow and often merely symbolic. In the contemporary political map, the idea civil society revivalism has been evoked by progressive activists and subsequently reduced to symbolic acts with very little substance. On the left, progressive advocates envision the idea of decentralized activism in a third, non-governmental sphere as a way of reviving democratic participation and rebuilding the state from the bottom up. By contrast, the idea of civil society has been embraced by conservative politicians as a means for replacing government funded programs and steering away from state intervention. Subsequently, recent uses of civil society have subverted the ideals of progressive social reform and replaced them with conservative agendas that reject egalitarian ideals of social provision. In particular, recent calls to strengthen civil society have been advanced by politicians interested in the dismantling the modern welfare system. Conservative civil society revivalism often equates the idea of self-help through extra-legal means with traditional family structures, and blames the breakdown of those structures (e.g., the rise of the single parent family) for the increase in reliance and dependency on government aid.137 This recent depiction of the third sphere of civic life is averse to legal reform precisely because state intervention may support newer, non-traditional social structures. For conservative thinkers, legal reform also risks reifying increased dependency on social services by groups who have been traditionally marginalized, including disproportionate reliance on public funds by people of color and single mothers. Indeed, the end of “welfare as we knew it,”138 as well as transformation of “work as we knew it,”139 has led thinkers from all sides of the political spectrum to seek a third space that could replace the traditional functions of work and welfare. Paradoxically, a range of liberal and conservative visions have thus converged into the same agendas, such as the recent welfare-to-work reforms, which rely on a myriad of non-governmental institutions and activities to support these new arrangements.140 Drawing on the range of unbundled cooptation categories, it becomes evident that the limits of the contemporary extra-legal currant are multiple. First, there have been significant problems with resources and zero sum energies in recent campaigns surrounding community development and welfare. For example, the initial vision of welfare to work supported by liberal reformers was that of a multifaceted, dynamic system that would reshape the roles and responsibilities of welfare bureaucracy. President Clinton’s 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA)141 was designed to convert various welfare programs, including the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), into a single block grant program and to convert passive cash assistance into a more active welfare system, where individuals are to be better assisted, by both government and the community, to return to the labor force and find opportunities to support themselves.142 Yet, from the broader vision to actual implementation, the program quickly became limited in focus and in resources. PRWORA placed new limits on welfare provision by eliminating eligibility categories and by placing rigid time limits on provision of benefits. The need to frame the questions of poverty in institutional arrangements, professional jargon, and to comply with various funding block grants has made some issues such as statistical reduction of welfare recipients more salient in the reform, while other issues, such as the quality of jobs offered, have been largely eliminated from the policy thinking. Even those of aspects of the reform were hailed as empowering for those groups they were designed to help, 141 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, 1996, Public law 104-193, 110 STAT. 2105 (converting the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program, and other welfare programs into a single block grant program to be used by states to provide cash and other benefits to individuals and families in need). 142 Barbara L. Bezdek, Contractual Welfare: Non-Accountability and Diminished Democracy in Local Government Contracts for Welfare-to-Work Services, 28 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1559, 1589 (2001). 48 like individual private training vouchers, there have been serious questions raised about the adequacy of the particular policy design when resources and institutional support are found lacking. As in the areas in the case of child care, health care, and educational vouchers, critiques worry that the most disadvantaged workers in the new market will not be able to take advantage of these reforms and that poverty will become the justification, rather than the goal, of these arrangements. In terms of classical cooptation critique, once reforms are envisioned, even when they need not be frame in legalistic terms, they in some ways become reduced to a handful of issues, while fragmenting, neglecting, and ultimately naturalizing other possibilities. At this point, the paradox of extra-legal activism unfolds. While public interest thinkers are increasingly embracing an axiomatic rejection of law as the primary form of progress, an embrace of a non-legal alternative presents parallel risks. The rejection of the “myth of the law/rights” is replaced by a “myth of activism” or the “myth of exit,” romanticizing a distinct sphere that can better solve social conflict. Yet, the myth, like other myths, comes complete with its own perpetual perils. The myth of exit exemplifies the myriad of concerns of cooptation. For feminist agendas for example, the separation of the world into distinct spheres of action has been a continuous impediment. Efforts to bring better possibilities for women to balance work and family responsibilities, including efforts to relax home work rules and to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation, have been couched in terms of support of individual choice and private decision making.143 Indeed, recent initiatives to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation have been clouded with preconceptions of the separation of spheres and the need to make one-or-the-other life choices. Most importantly, the 143 Nancy E. Dowd, Work and Family: Restructuring the Workplace, 32 Ariz. Law Rev. 431 (1990). 49 emergence of a sphere-oriented discourse abandons a critical perspective that distinguishes between valorizing traditionally gendered characteristics and celebrating feminine difference in a universalistic and essentialist manner.144 Not surprisingly then, some feminists writers have responded to civil society revivalism with great skepticism, arguing that efforts to align feminine values and agendas with classical republican theory of civil society activism should be understood at least in part as a way of legitimizing historical social structures in which women were traditionally subordinated.145 The feminist lesson surrounding the law/exit pendulum reveals a broader pattern. In a classic schematic analysis of cooptation, activists should in effect be concerned about the infusion (or indeed confusion) of non-legal strategies with conservative privatization agendas. In significant social policy contexts, legal scholarship oriented toward the exploration of extra-legal paths reinforces the exact narrative that is originally resisted -- that the state cannot and should not be accountable for sustaining and improving the lifeworld of individuals in the 21st century economy and that we must seek alternative ways to bring social reform. Whether described as a path-dependent process, an inevitable downward spiral, a transnational prisoner’s dilemma, or a necessary global race-to-the-bottom, in practice current analyses often suggest a lack of control vis-à-vis the forces of new economic realities. Rather than countering the story of lack of control, pointing to the on-going role of government, and showing the contradictions between that which is being kept regulated and that which is privatized, alternative extra-legal scholarship accepts these developments as natural and inevitable. Similarly to the 144 Judith Stacey, IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY: RETHINKING FAMILY VALUES IN THE POSTMODERN AGE (1995). See also, Frances Olsen, The Family and the Market, Harv. L. Rev. 145 Nancy E. Dowd, WORK AND FAMILY: RESTRUCTURING THE WORKPLACE, 32 Ariz. L. Rev. 431, 486 (1990); Suzanna Sherry, Civic Virtue and the Feminine Voice in Constitutional Adjudication, 72 Virginia Law Rev. 543 (1986). 50 arguments developed in relation to the labor movement, where to focus on a limited right to collective bargaining demobilized workers and stripped them from their demands of voice, participation and decision making powers, contemporary agendas are limited to very narrow and patterned sets of reforms. A striking example has been the focus on welfare reform as the single frontier of economic redistribution without relating these reforms to on-going commitments to social services in which the middle class has a strong interest, such as Social Security and Medicare. Similarly, on the legal pluralism frontier, when activists call for more corporate social responsibility, the initial expressions are those of broad demands for ssustainable development and overall obligations of industry for the social and environmental consequences of their activities.146 The discourse however quickly becomes coopted with a shift to a narrow focus on charitable donations and corporate philanthrophy or private reporting absent an institutionalized compliance structure. Moreover, because of institutional limitations and crowding out effects, the focus quickly becomes thinking of the benefits of CSR to businesses, as a marketing, recruitment strategy, public relations and “greenwashing” strategies. Critics thereby become deeply cynical about the real commitments by industry actual motivations for ethical conduct. A similar process can be described with regard to the literature on globalization. Globalization scholarship often attempts to produce a unifying narrative and an image of unitary struggle when in fact such unity does not exist. Embodied in the aforementioned irony of a “global anti-globalization” movement, social reform activism that resides under the umbrella of global movements is greatly diverse, some of it highly conservative. An “anti-globalization movement” can be a defensive nationalist movement 146 World Business Council for Sustainable Development, CSR: Meeting Changing Expectations, 1999. 51 infused with xenophobia and protective ideologies.147 In fact, during central instances of collective action, such as those in Seattle, Quebec, Puerto Alegre, and Genoa, competing and conflicting claims have been frequently encompassed in the same momentary protest.148 Nevertheless, there is a tendency to celebrate and idealize these protests and infuse them with a world-altering image. Similarly, at the local level, grassroots politics often lack a clear agenda and are particularly ripe for cooptation processes whereby activists produce far lesser results than what may have been expected by the groups they represent. In a critical introduction of the Law and Organizing model, Cummings and Eagly, describe the ways in which new community-based approaches to progressive lawyering privilege grassroots movement politics over law reform efforts and privilege the facilitation of community mobilization over conventional lawyering. When the ways the ways in which law and organizing are currently embraced by community lawyers are carefully unpack, Cummings and Eagly rightfully warn against “exaggerating the ineffectiveness of traditional legal interventions” and “closing off potential avenues for redress.”149 Significantly, the strategies embraced by new public interest lawyers have not been demonstrated to produce effective change in the communities and certainly there has been no assurance that these strategies fair comparatively better than legal reform .

"In the following sections, I argue that in the effort to avoid the risk of legal cooptation, the current wave of suggested alternatives produces a mirror result of practical and conceptual cooptation. Three central types of difficulties exist with contemporary extra-legal scholarship. First, in the former contexts of the labor movement and the civil rights era, arguments about legal cooptation often developed in response to a perceived gap between the conceptual ideal toward which a social reform group struggles and its actual implementation. Paradoxically, in the contemporary message of opting out of traditional legal reforms avenues, this problem is in fact accentuated. As the move to such concepts as informalization -- moving to non-legal strategies, civil society – moving to extra-legal spheres, and pluralism -- the proliferation of norm-generating actors, has been developed and appropriated by supporters from a wide range of political commitments, these concepts have had unintended implications that are in conflict with the very social reform ideals from which they stem. Second, the idea of opting-out of the legal arena becomes self-defeating as it conceals the on-going importance of law and the possibilities of law reform in seemingly unregulated spheres. A model of exit and rigid sphere distinctions further fails to recognize a reality of increasing interpenetration and blurring of boundaries between private and public spheres; profit and non-profit sectors; and formal and informal institutions. It therefore loses the critical insight that understands law as operating in the background of seemingly unregulated relationships. Finally, the romantic notion of a privileged sphere, mode and means of action fails to develop tools for evaluating its success. If the critique of legal cooptation has involved the argument that legal reform, even when viewed as a victory, is never radically transformative, we must ask what are the criteria for assessing the achievements of the suggested alternatives? As shall be illustrated in the following sections, much of the current scholarship obscures the lines between the descriptive and the prescriptive in its exploration and formulation of social activism. If current suggestions present themselves as an alternative to formal legal struggles, we must question whether the new extra-legal politics that are proposed and celebrated are capable of producing a constructive theory and meaningful channels for reform, rather than passive status quo politics. Practical Failures: When Extra-Legal Alternatives Are Vehicles For Conservative Agendas We don’t want the 1950s back. We want to edit them. We want to keep the safe streets, the friendly grocers, and the milk and cookies, while blotting out the political bosses, the tyrannical headmasters, the inflexible rules, and the lectures on 100% Americanism and the sinfulness of dissent.135 A basic structure of cooptation arguments as developed in relation to the labor and civil rights movements has been to show how in the move from theory to practice, the ideal that was promoted by a social group receives unintended content, thus failing to realize the original vision. This is particularly true when concepts are framed in broad terms that are open to multiple interpretations. The pitfalls of the range of risks presented under the umbrella of cooptation are in fact accentuated in current proposals. Paradoxically, current suggestions that are framed by way of opposition to formal law reform paths risk precisely such cooptative meanings. Extra-legal paths are depicted mostly in negative terms, as resorting to alternative forms of action than former models. Accordingly, because the ideas of organizing, civil society and legal pluralism are framed in open-ended contrarian terms, they do not translate into specific visions of social justice reform. The case of civil society, which has been embraced by people from a broad array of, and indeed often conflicting, ideological commitments, is particularly demonstrative. As Alan Wolfe has argued, “some ideas fail because they never make the light of day. The idea of civil society…failed because it became too popular.”136 In former eras, the claims about the legal cooptation of the transformative visions of workplace justice and racial equality was that through legal strategies the vision became stripped from the initial depth; fragmented and framed in ways that were narrow and often merely symbolic. In the contemporary political map, the idea civil society revivalism has been evoked by progressive activists and subsequently reduced to symbolic acts with very little substance. On the left, progressive advocates envision the idea of decentralized activism in a third, non-governmental sphere as a way of reviving democratic participation and rebuilding the state from the bottom up. By contrast, the idea of civil society has been embraced by conservative politicians as a means for replacing government funded programs and steering away from state intervention. Subsequently, recent uses of civil society have subverted the ideals of progressive social reform and replaced them with conservative agendas that reject egalitarian ideals of social provision. In particular, recent calls to strengthen civil society have been advanced by politicians interested in the dismantling the modern welfare system. Conservative civil society revivalism often equates the idea of self-help through extra-legal means with traditional family structures, and blames the breakdown of those structures (e.g., the rise of the single parent family) for the increase in reliance and dependency on government aid.137 This recent depiction of the third sphere of civic life is averse to legal reform precisely because state intervention may support newer, non-traditional social structures. For conservative thinkers, legal reform also risks reifying increased dependency on social services by groups who have been traditionally marginalized, including disproportionate reliance on public funds by people of color and single mothers. Indeed, the end of “welfare as we knew it,”138 as well as transformation of “work as we knew it,”139 has led thinkers from all sides of the political spectrum to seek a third space that could replace the traditional functions of work and welfare. Paradoxically, a range of liberal and conservative visions have thus converged into the same agendas, such as the recent welfare-to-work reforms, which rely on a myriad of non-governmental institutions and activities to support these new arrangements.140 Drawing on the range of unbundled cooptation categories, it becomes evident that the limits of the contemporary extra-legal currant are multiple. First, there have been significant problems with resources and zero sum energies in recent campaigns surrounding community development and welfare. For example, the initial vision of welfare to work supported by liberal reformers was that of a multifaceted, dynamic system that would reshape the roles and responsibilities of welfare bureaucracy. President Clinton’s 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA)141 was designed to convert various welfare programs, including the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), into a single block grant program and to convert passive cash assistance into a more active welfare system, where individuals are to be better assisted, by both government and the community, to return to the labor force and find opportunities to support themselves.142 Yet, from the broader vision to actual implementation, the program quickly became limited in focus and in resources. PRWORA placed new limits on welfare provision by eliminating eligibility categories and by placing rigid time limits on provision of benefits. The need to frame the questions of poverty in institutional arrangements, professional jargon, and to comply with various funding block grants has made some issues such as statistical reduction of welfare recipients more salient in the reform, while other issues, such as the quality of jobs offered, have been largely eliminated from the policy thinking. Even those of aspects of the reform were hailed as empowering for those groups they were designed to help, 141 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, 1996, Public law 104-193, 110 STAT. 2105 (converting the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program, and other welfare programs into a single block grant program to be used by states to provide cash and other benefits to individuals and families in need). 142 Barbara L. Bezdek, Contractual Welfare: Non-Accountability and Diminished Democracy in Local Government Contracts for Welfare-to-Work Services, 28 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1559, 1589 (2001). 48 like individual private training vouchers, there have been serious questions raised about the adequacy of the particular policy design when resources and institutional support are found lacking. As in the areas in the case of child care, health care, and educational vouchers, critiques worry that the most disadvantaged workers in the new market will not be able to take advantage of these reforms and that poverty will become the justification, rather than the goal, of these arrangements. In terms of classical cooptation critique, once reforms are envisioned, even when they need not be frame in legalistic terms, they in some ways become reduced to a handful of issues, while fragmenting, neglecting, and ultimately naturalizing other possibilities. At this point, the paradox of extra-legal activism unfolds. While public interest thinkers are increasingly embracing an axiomatic rejection of law as the primary form of progress, an embrace of a non-legal alternative presents parallel risks. The rejection of the “myth of the law/rights” is replaced by a “myth of activism” or the “myth of exit,” romanticizing a distinct sphere that can better solve social conflict. Yet, the myth, like other myths, comes complete with its own perpetual perils. The myth of exit exemplifies the myriad of concerns of cooptation. For feminist agendas for example, the separation of the world into distinct spheres of action has been a continuous impediment. Efforts to bring better possibilities for women to balance work and family responsibilities, including efforts to relax home work rules and to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation, have been couched in terms of support of individual choice and private decision making.143 Indeed, recent initiatives to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation have been clouded with preconceptions of the separation of spheres and the need to make one-or-the-other life choices. Most importantly, the 143 Nancy E. Dowd, Work and Family: Restructuring the Workplace, 32 Ariz. Law Rev. 431 (1990). 49 emergence of a sphere-oriented discourse abandons a critical perspective that distinguishes between valorizing traditionally gendered characteristics and celebrating feminine difference in a universalistic and essentialist manner.144 Not surprisingly then, some feminists writers have responded to civil society revivalism with great skepticism, arguing that efforts to align feminine values and agendas with classical republican theory of civil society activism should be understood at least in part as a way of legitimizing historical social structures in which women were traditionally subordinated.145 The feminist lesson surrounding the law/exit pendulum reveals a broader pattern. In a classic schematic analysis of cooptation, activists should in effect be concerned about the infusion (or indeed confusion) of non-legal strategies with conservative privatization agendas. In significant social policy contexts, legal scholarship oriented toward the exploration of extra-legal paths reinforces the exact narrative that is originally resisted -- that the state cannot and should not be accountable for sustaining and improving the lifeworld of individuals in the 21st century economy and that we must seek alternative ways to bring social reform. Whether described as a path-dependent process, an inevitable downward spiral, a transnational prisoner’s dilemma, or a necessary global race-to-the-bottom, in practice current analyses often suggest a lack of control vis-à-vis the forces of new economic realities. Rather than countering the story of lack of control, pointing to the on-going role of government, and showing the contradictions between that which is being kept regulated and that which is privatized, alternative extra-legal scholarship accepts these developments as natural and inevitable. Similarly to the 144 Judith Stacey, IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY: RETHINKING FAMILY VALUES IN THE POSTMODERN AGE (1995). See also, Frances Olsen, The Family and the Market, Harv. L. Rev. 145 Nancy E. Dowd, WORK AND FAMILY: RESTRUCTURING THE WORKPLACE, 32 Ariz. L. Rev. 431, 486 (1990); Suzanna Sherry, Civic Virtue and the Feminine Voice in Constitutional Adjudication, 72 Virginia Law Rev. 543 (1986). 50 arguments developed in relation to the labor movement, where to focus on a limited right to collective bargaining demobilized workers and stripped them from their demands of voice, participation and decision making powers, contemporary agendas are limited to very narrow and patterned sets of reforms. A striking example has been the focus on welfare reform as the single frontier of economic redistribution without relating these reforms to on-going commitments to social services in which the middle class has a strong interest, such as Social Security and Medicare. Similarly, on the legal pluralism frontier, when activists call for more corporate social responsibility, the initial expressions are those of broad demands for ssustainable development and overall obligations of industry for the social and environmental consequences of their activities.146 The discourse however quickly becomes coopted with a shift to a narrow focus on charitable donations and corporate philanthrophy or private reporting absent an institutionalized compliance structure. Moreover, because of institutional limitations and crowding out effects, the focus quickly becomes thinking of the benefits of CSR to businesses, as a marketing, recruitment strategy, public relations and “greenwashing” strategies. Critics thereby become deeply cynical about the real commitments by industry actual motivations for ethical conduct. A similar process can be described with regard to the literature on globalization. Globalization scholarship often attempts to produce a unifying narrative and an image of unitary struggle when in fact such unity does not exist. Embodied in the aforementioned irony of a “global anti-globalization” movement, social reform activism that resides under the umbrella of global movements is greatly diverse, some of it highly conservative. An “anti-globalization movement” can be a defensive nationalist movement 146 World Business Council for Sustainable Development, CSR: Meeting Changing Expectations, 1999. 51 infused with xenophobia and protective ideologies.147 In fact, during central instances of collective action, such as those in Seattle, Quebec, Puerto Alegre, and Genoa, competing and conflicting claims have been frequently encompassed in the same momentary protest.148 Nevertheless, there is a tendency to celebrate and idealize these protests and infuse them with a world-altering image. Similarly, at the local level, grassroots politics often lack a clear agenda and are particularly ripe for cooptation processes whereby activists produce far lesser results than what may have been expected by the groups they represent. In a critical introduction of the Law and Organizing model, Cummings and Eagly, describe the ways in which new community-based approaches to progressive lawyering privilege grassroots movement politics over law reform efforts and privilege the facilitation of community mobilization over conventional lawyering. When the ways the ways in which law and organizing are currently embraced by community lawyers are carefully unpack, Cummings and Eagly rightfully warn against “exaggerating the ineffectiveness of traditional legal interventions” and “closing off potential avenues for redress.”149 Significantly, the strategies embraced by new public interest lawyers have not been demonstrated to produce effective change in the communities and certainly there has been no assurance that these strategies fair comparatively better than legal reform . Moreover, what are meant to be progressive projects of community action and community economic development can frequently entail an underlying effect of excluding worse-off groups, such as migrant workers, from their limited geographical 147 See Cecilia Lynch, Social Movements and the Problem of Globalization, 23 Alternatives 149 (1998); 148 Frederick M.

Conservative civil society revivalism often equates the idea of self-help through extra-legal means with traditional family structures, and blames the breakdown of those structures (e.g., the rise of the single parent family) for the increase in reliance and dependency on government aid.137 This recent depiction of the third sphere of civic life is averse to legal reform precisely because state intervention may support newer, non-traditional social structures. For conservative thinkers, legal reform also risks reifying increased dependency on social services by groups who have been traditionally marginalized, including disproportionate reliance on public funds by people of color and single mothers. Indeed, the end of “welfare as we knew it,”138 as well as transformation of “work as we knew it,”139 has led thinkers from all sides of the political spectrum to seek a third space that could replace the traditional functions of work and welfare. Paradoxically, a range of liberal and conservative visions have thus converged into the same agendas, such as the recent welfare-to-work reforms, which rely on a myriad of non-governmental institutions and activities to support these new arrangements.140 Drawing on the range of unbundled cooptation categories, it becomes evident that the limits of the contemporary extra-legal currant are multiple. First, there have been significant problems with resources and zero sum energies in recent campaigns surrounding community development and welfare. For example, the initial vision of welfare to work supported by liberal reformers was that of a multifaceted, dynamic system that would reshape the roles and responsibilities of welfare bureaucracy. President Clinton’s 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA)141 was designed to convert various welfare programs, including the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), into a single block grant program and to convert passive cash assistance into a more active welfare system, where individuals are to be better assisted, by both government and the community, to return to the labor force and find opportunities to support themselves.142 Yet, from the broader vision to actual implementation, the program quickly became limited in focus and in resources. PRWORA placed new limits on welfare provision by eliminating eligibility categories and by placing rigid time limits on provision of benefits. The need to frame the questions of poverty in institutional arrangements, professional jargon, and to comply with various funding block grants has made some issues such as statistical reduction of welfare recipients more salient in the reform, while other issues, such as the quality of jobs offered, have been largely eliminated from the policy thinking. Even those of aspects of the reform were hailed as empowering for those groups they were designed to help, 141 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, 1996, Public law 104-193, 110 STAT. 2105 (converting the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program, and other welfare programs into a single block grant program to be used by states to provide cash and other benefits to individuals and families in need). 142 Barbara L. Bezdek, Contractual Welfare: Non-Accountability and Diminished Democracy in Local Government Contracts for Welfare-to-Work Services, 28 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1559, 1589 (2001). 48 like individual private training vouchers, there have been serious questions raised about the adequacy of the particular policy design when resources and institutional support are found lacking. As in the areas in the case of child care, health care, and educational vouchers, critiques worry that the most disadvantaged workers in the new market will not be able to take advantage of these reforms and that poverty will become the justification, rather than the goal, of these arrangements. In terms of classical cooptation critique, once reforms are envisioned, even when they need not be frame in legalistic terms, they in some ways become reduced to a handful of issues, while fragmenting, neglecting, and ultimately naturalizing other possibilities. At this point, the paradox of extra-legal activism unfolds. While public interest thinkers are increasingly embracing an axiomatic rejection of law as the primary form of progress, an embrace of a non-legal alternative presents parallel risks. The rejection of the “myth of the law/rights” is replaced by a “myth of activism” or the “myth of exit,” romanticizing a distinct sphere that can better solve social conflict. Yet, the myth, like other myths, comes complete with its own perpetual perils. The myth of exit exemplifies the myriad of concerns of cooptation. For feminist agendas for example, the separation of the world into distinct spheres of action has been a continuous impediment. Efforts to bring better possibilities for women to balance work and family responsibilities, including efforts to relax home work rules and to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation, have been couched in terms of support of individual choice and private decision making.143 Indeed, recent initiatives to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation have been clouded with preconceptions of the separation of spheres and the need to make one-or-the-other life choices. Most importantly, the 143 Nancy E. Dowd, Work and Family: Restructuring the Workplace, 32 Ariz. Law Rev. 431 (1990). 49 emergence of a sphere-oriented discourse abandons a critical perspective that distinguishes between valorizing traditionally gendered characteristics and celebrating feminine difference in a universalistic and essentialist manner.144 Not surprisingly then, some feminists writers have responded to civil society revivalism with great skepticism, arguing that efforts to align feminine values and agendas with classical republican theory of civil society activism should be understood at least in part as a way of legitimizing historical social structures in which women were traditionally subordinated.145 The feminist lesson surrounding the law/exit pendulum reveals a broader pattern. In a classic schematic analysis of cooptation, activists should in effect be concerned about the infusion (or indeed confusion) of non-legal strategies with conservative privatization agendas. In significant social policy contexts, legal scholarship oriented toward the exploration of extra-legal paths reinforces the exact narrative that is originally resisted -- that the state cannot and should not be accountable for sustaining and improving the lifeworld of individuals in the 21st century economy and that we must seek alternative ways to bring social reform. Whether described as a path-dependent process, an inevitable downward spiral, a transnational prisoner’s dilemma, or a necessary global race-to-the-bottom, in practice current analyses often suggest a lack of control vis-à-vis the forces of new economic realities. Rather than countering the story of lack of control, pointing to the on-going role of government, and showing the contradictions between that which is being kept regulated and that which is privatized, alternative extra-legal scholarship accepts these developments as natural and inevitable. Similarly to the 144 Judith Stacey, IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY: RETHINKING FAMILY VALUES IN THE POSTMODERN AGE (1995). See also, Frances Olsen, The Family and the Market, Harv. L. Rev. 145 Nancy E. Dowd, WORK AND FAMILY: RESTRUCTURING THE WORKPLACE, 32 Ariz. L. Rev. 431, 486 (1990); Suzanna Sherry, Civic Virtue and the Feminine Voice in Constitutional Adjudication, 72 Virginia Law Rev. 543 (1986). 50 arguments developed in relation to the labor movement, where to focus on a limited right to collective bargaining demobilized workers and stripped them from their demands of voice, participation and decision making powers, contemporary agendas are limited to very narrow and patterned sets of reforms. A striking example has been the focus on welfare reform as the single frontier of economic redistribution without relating these reforms to on-going commitments to social services in which the middle class has a strong interest, such as Social Security and Medicare. Similarly, on the legal pluralism frontier, when activists call for more corporate social responsibility, the initial expressions are those of broad demands for ssustainable development and overall obligations of industry for the social and environmental consequences of their activities.146 The discourse however quickly becomes coopted with a shift to a narrow focus on charitable donations and corporate philanthrophy or private reporting absent an institutionalized compliance structure. Moreover, because of institutional limitations and crowding out effects, the focus quickly becomes thinking of the benefits of CSR to businesses, as a marketing, recruitment strategy, public relations and “greenwashing” strategies. Critics thereby become deeply cynical about the real commitments by industry actual motivations for ethical conduct. A similar process can be described with regard to the literature on globalization. Globalization scholarship often attempts to produce a unifying narrative and an image of unitary struggle when in fact such unity does not exist. Embodied in the aforementioned irony of a “global anti-globalization” movement, social reform activism that resides under the umbrella of global movements is greatly diverse, some of it highly conservative. An “anti-globalization movement” can be a defensive nationalist movement 146 World Business Council for Sustainable Development, CSR: Meeting Changing Expectations, 1999. 51 infused with xenophobia and protective ideologies.147 In fact, during central instances of collective action, such as those in Seattle, Quebec, Puerto Alegre, and Genoa, competing and conflicting claims have been frequently encompassed in the same momentary protest.148 Nevertheless, there is a tendency to celebrate and idealize these protests and infuse them with a world-altering image. Similarly, at the local level, grassroots politics often lack a clear agenda and are particularly ripe for cooptation processes whereby activists produce far lesser results than what may have been expected by the groups they represent. In a critical introduction of the Law and Organizing model, Cummings and Eagly, describe the ways in which new community-based approaches to progressive lawyering privilege grassroots movement politics over law reform efforts and privilege the facilitation of community mobilization over conventional lawyering. When the ways the ways in which law and organizing are currently embraced by community lawyers are carefully unpack, Cummings and Eagly rightfully warn against “exaggerating the ineffectiveness of traditional legal interventions” and “closing off potential avenues for redress.”149 Significantly, the strategies embraced by new public interest lawyers have not been demonstrated to produce effective change in the communities and certainly there has been no assurance that these strategies fair comparatively better than legal reform . Moreover, what are meant to be progressive projects of community action and community economic development can frequently entail an underlying effect of excluding worse-off groups, such as migrant workers, from their limited geographical 147 See Cecilia Lynch, Social Movements and the Problem of Globalization, 23 Alternatives 149 (1998); 148 Frederick M. Abbott, TRIPS in Seattle: The Not-So-Surprising Failure and the Future of the TRIPS Agenda, 18 Berkeley J. Int'l L. 165 (2000). 149 Id at 491. 52 scope.150 Again, like with the corporate social responsibility movement, and similarly to the ways critical scholars have assessed the decline of the labor movement framework through the embrace of a legal framework, a feature of the community economic development, which has become since the early 1990s a dominant approach to poverty relief, is its appeal to diverse ideological agendas.151 In all of these cases, it is the act of engagement, not law, which holds the risks of cooptation and the politics of compromise. It is not the particularities of lawyers as a professional group that creates dependency. Rather, it is the dynamics between skilled, networked and resourced components in the organization and those who need them that may submerge goals and create reliance. It is not the particularities of the structural limitations of the judiciary that threaten to limit the progressive vision of social movements. Rather, it is the essential difficulties of implementing theory into practice. Life is simply messier than any abstract ideals. Cooptation analysis exposes the broader risk of assuming ownership over a rhetorical and conceptual framework. Subsequently, when, in practice, others factions in the political debate embrace the language and frame their projects in similar terms, groups experience a sense of loss of control or possession of “their” vision. In the contemporary context, in the absence of a more programmatic concrete vision of what alternative models of social reform activism need to achieve, the conclusions and rhetoric of the contemporary critical legal consciousness are appropriated by a wide range of political commitments. Understood from this 150 Audrey G. McFarlane, Race, Space, and Place: The Geography of Economic Development, 36 San Diego L. Rev. 295, 318-19 (1999). 151 Scott Cummings, 54 Stan. L.

L. 161(2000). 53 perspective, cooptation is not the result of the turn to a particular reform strategy. Rather, cooptation occurs when imagined ideals are left unchecked and seemingly progressive rhetoric is produced by a conservative agenda. Dominant meanings such as privatization and market competitiveness come ahead, while other meanings, such as progressive ideals including group empowerment and redistributive justice, serve to facilitate and stabilize the process.1",summarize the following text: ,"in the effort to avoid the risk of legal cooptation, the current wave of suggested alternatives produces a mirror result of practical and conceptual cooptation. arguments about legal cooptation often developed in response to a perceived gap between the conceptual ideal toward which a social reform group struggles the contemporary message of opting out of traditional legal reforms avenues this problem is in fact accentuated As the move to such concepts as informalization non-legal strategies, civil society proliferation of norm-generating actors these concepts have had unintended implications that are in conflict with the very social reform ideals from which they stem A model of exit and rigid sphere distinctions further fails to recognize a reality of increasing interpenetration and blurring of boundaries between private and public spheres; It therefore loses the critical insight that understands law as operating in the background of seemingly unregulated relationships. the romantic notion of a privileged sphere, mode and means of action fails to develop tools for evaluating its success . If current suggestions present themselves as an alternative to formal legal struggles, we must question whether the new extra-legal politics that are proposed and celebrated are capable of producing a constructive theory and meaningful channels for reform, rather than passive status quo politics. Practical Failures: When Extra-Legal Alternatives Are Vehicles For Conservative Agendas A basic structure of cooptation arguments as developed in relation to the labor and civil rights movements has been to show how in the move from theory to practice, the ideal that was promoted by a social group receives This is particularly true when concepts are framed in broad terms that are open to multiple interpretations current suggestions that are framed by way of opposition to formal law reform paths risk precisely such cooptative meanings civil society and legal pluralism are framed in open-ended contrarian terms, they do not translate into specific visions of social justice reform. legal cooptation of the transformative visions of workplace justice and racial equality was that through legal strategies the vision became stripped from the initial depth; , the idea civil society revivalism has been evoked by progressive activists and subsequently reduced to symbolic acts with very little substance progressive advocates envision the idea of decentralized activism in a third, non-governmental sphere as a way of reviving democratic participation and rebuilding the state from the bottom up the idea of civil society has been embraced by conservative politicians as a means for replacing government funded programs and steering away from state intervention recent uses subverted the ideals of progressive social reform replaced them with conservative agendas that reject egalitarian ideals of social provision. calls to strengthen civil society have been advanced by politicians interested in the dismantling the modern welfare system Conservative civil society revivalism often equates the idea of self-help through extra-legal means with traditional family structures For conservative thinkers, legal reform also risks reifying increased dependency on social services by groups who have been traditionally marginalized Paradoxically, a range of liberal and conservative visions have thus converged into the same agendas, such as the recent welfare-to-work reforms, which rely on a myriad of non-governmental institutions and activities to support these new arrangements At this point, the paradox of extra-legal activism unfolds.

"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"
"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.

China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"
"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32 Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government. There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort. To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then: South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000 North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000 South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies. However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action. In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious. North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible. The American Dimension These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below). Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil. Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies. The Nuclear Dimension Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33 Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional. As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment. On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario. The China Dimension How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity. However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38 Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40 Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government. China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula. A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash. For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45 The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang. But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces these scenarios could lead to a major conflict The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea with an eye toward securing weapons of mass destruction These goals would be most realistically achieved by overthrowing the North Korean government There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support this thinking is flawed.

The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil. Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies. The Nuclear Dimension Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33 Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional. As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment. On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario. The China Dimension How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity. However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38 Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40 Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government. China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula. A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash. For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45 The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang. But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces these scenarios could lead to a major conflict The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea with an eye toward securing w of m  d These goals would be most realistically achieved by overthrowing the North Korean government There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case.

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms.

This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have.

Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45

The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.

"The ethics of affirmation, with its emphasis on moving across the pain and transforming it into activity, may seem counter-intuitive. In our culture people go to great lengths to ease all pain, but especially the pain of uncertainty about identity, origin, and belonging. Great distress follows from not knowing or not being able to articulate the source of one’s suffering, or from knowing it all too well, all the time. People who have been confronted by the irreparable, the unbearable, the insur-mountable, the traumatic and inhuman event will do anything to find solace, resolution, and also compensation. The yearning for these mea-sures—solace, closure, justice—is all too understandable and worthy of respect. Nowadays, this longing is both supported and commercially ex-ploited by genetics and its application to tracking of racial and territorial origins. The ethical dilemma was already posed by Jean-François Lyotard in Le Differend and, much earlier, by Primo Levi about the survivors of Nazi concentration camps: the kind of vulnerability human beings experience in face of events on the scale of high horror is something for which no adequate compensation is even thinkable, let alone applicable. There is an incommensurability of the suffering involved for which no measure of compensation is possible—a hurt or wound beyond repair. This means that the notion of justice in the sense of a logic of rights and reparation is not applicable in a quantifiable manner. For Lyotard, in keeping with the poststructuralist emphasis on the ethical dimension on the problem, ethics consists in accepting the impossibility of adequate compensation, and living with the open wound. On the contrary, contemporary culture has taken the opposite direction: it has favored, encouraged, and re-warded a public morality based on the twin principles of claims and compensation, as if financial settlements could provide the answer to the injury suffered, the pain endured, and the long-lasting effects of the injustice. Cases that exemplify this trend are the compensation for the Shoah in the sense of restitution of stolen property, artworks, and bank deposits. Similar claims have been made by the descendants of slaves forcefully removed from Africa to North America (Gilroy, 2000), and more recently compensation for damages caused by Soviet communism, no-tably the confiscation of properties across eastern Europe, from Jewish and other former citizens. The ethics of affirmation is about suspending the quest for both claims and compensation, resisting the logic of retribution of rights and taking instead a different road. In order to understand this move it is important to de-psychologize the discussion of affirmation. Affectivity is intrinsically understood as positive: it is the force that aims at fulfilling the subject’s capacity for interaction and freedom. It is Spinoza’s cona-tus, or the notion of potentia as the affirmative aspect of power. It is joyful and pleasureprone, and it is immanent in that it coincides with the terms and modes of its expression. This means concretely that ethical behavior confirms, facilitates, and enhances the subject’s potentia, as the capacity to express his/her freedom. The positivity of this desire to ex-press one’s innermost and constitutive freedom (conatus, potentia, or becoming) is conducive to ethical behavior, however, only if the subject is capable of making it endure, thus allowing it to sustain its own im-petus. Unethical behavior achieves the opposite: it denies, hinders, and diminishes that impetus or is unable to sustain it. Affirmation is therefore not naive optimism or Candide-like unrealism. It is about endurance and transformation. Endurance is self affirmation. It is also an ethical prin-ciple of affirmation of the positivity of the intensive subject—its joyful affirmation as potentia. The subject is a spatiotemporal compound which frames the boundaries of processes of becoming. This works by transforming negative into positive passions through the power of an understanding that is no longer indexed upon a phallogocentric set of standards, but is rather unhinged and therefore affective. This sort of turning of the tide of negativity is the transformative process of achieving freedom of understanding through the awareness of our limits, of our bondage. This results in the freedom to affirm one’s essence as joy, through encounters and minglings with other bodies, entities, beings, and forces. Ethics means faithfulness to this potentia, or the desire to become. Deleuze defines the latter with reference to Bergson’s concept of “duration,” thus proposing the notion of the subject as an entity that lasts, that endures sustainable changes and trans-formation and enacts them around him/herself in a community or collectivity. Affirmative ethics rests on the idea of sustainability as a principle of containment and tolerable development of a subject’s re-sources, understood environmentally, affectively, and cognitively. A sub-ject thus constituted inhabits a time that is the active tense of continuous “becoming.” Endurance has therefore a temporal dimension: it has to do with lasting in time—hence duration and selfperpetuation. But it also has a spatial side to do with the space of the body as an enfleshed field of actualization of passions or forces. It evolves affectivity and joy, as in the capacity for being affected by these forces, to the point of pain or extreme pleasure, which come to the same; it means putting up with hardship and physical pain. The point, however, is that extreme pleasure or extreme pain—which may score the same on a Spinozist scale of ethology of affects—are of course not the same. On the reactive side of the equation, endurance points to the struggle to sustain the pain without being annihilated by it. It also introduces a temporal dimension about duration in time. This is linked to memory: intense pain, a wrong, a betrayal, a wound are hard to forget. The traumatic impact of painful events fixes them in a rigid, eternal present tense out of which it is difficult to emerge. This is the eternal return of that which precisely cannot be endured and returns in the mode of the unwanted, the untimely, the un-assimilated or in-appro-priate/d. They are also, however, paradoxically difficult to remember, insofar as re-membering entails retrieval and repetition of the pain itself. Psychoanalysis, of course, has been here before (Laplanche, 1976). The notion of the return of the repressed is the key to the logic of unconscious remembrance, but it is a secret and somewhat invisible key which condenses space into the spasm of the symptom and time into a short-circuit that mines the very thinkability of the present. Kristeva’s notion of the abject (1980) expresses clearly the temporality involved in psychoanalysis—by stressing the structural function played by the neg-ative, the incomprehensible, the unthinkable, the other of under-standable knowledge. Deleuze calls this alterity “Chaos” and defines it ontologically as the virtual formation of all possible form. Lacan, on the other hand—and Derrida with him, I would argue—defines Chaos epis-temologically as that which precedes form, structure, and language. This makes for two radicallydivergent conceptions of time and negativity. That which is incomprehensible for Lacan, following Hegel, is the virtual for Deleuze, following Spinoza, Bergson, and Leibnitz. This produces a number of significant shifts: from negative to affirmative; from entropic to generative; from incomprehensible, meaning-less, and crazy to virtual waiting to be actualized; from constituting constitutive outsides to a geometry of affects that require mutual syn-chronization; from a melancholy and split to an open-ended web-like subject; from the epistemological to the ontological turn in post-structuralist philosophy. This introduces a temporal dimension into the discussion that leads to the very conditions of possibility of the future, to futurity as such. For an ethics of sustainability, the expression of positive affects is that which makes the subject last or endure. It is like a source of long-term energy at the affective core of subjectivity (Grosz, 2004). Nietzsche has also been here before, of course. The eternal return in Nietzsche is the repetition, yet neither in the compulsive mode of neurosis nor in the negative erasure that marks the traumatic event. It is the eternal return of and as positivity (AnsellPearson, 1999). This kind of ethics addresses the affective structure of pain and suffering but does not locate the ethical instance within it, be it in the mode of compassionate witnessing (Bauman 1993; 1998) or empathic copresence. In a nomadic, Deleuz-ian-Nietzschean perspective, ethics is essentially about transformation of negative into positive passions, that is, about moving beyond the pain. This does not mean denying the pain but rather activating it, working it through. Again, the positivity here is not supposed to indicate a facile optimism or a careless dismissal of human suffering. What is positive in the ethics of affirmation is the belief that negative affects can be transformed. This implies a dynamic view of all affects, even those that freeze us in pain, horror, or mourning. Affirmative nomadic ethics puts the motion back into e-motion and the active back into activism, introducing movement, process, and becoming. This shift makes all the difference to the patterns of repetition of negative emo-tions. What is negative about negative affects is not a value judgment (any more than it is for the positivity of difference), but rather the effect of arrest, blockage, and rigidification that comes as a result of an act of violence, betrayal, a trauma—or which can be self-perpetuated through practices that our culture simultaneously chastises as self-destructive and cultivates as a mode of discipline and punishment: all forms of mild and extreme addictions, differing degrees of abusive practices that mortify and glorify the bodily matter, from binging to bodily modifications. Abu-sive, addictive, or destructive practices do not merely destroy the self but harm the self’s capacity to relate to others, both human and non-human others. Thus they harm the capacity to grow in and through others and become others. Negative passions diminish our capacity to express the high levels of interdependence, the vital reliance on others, which is the key to a non- unitary and dynamic vision of the subject. What is negated by negative passions is the power of life itself, as the dynamic force, vital flows of connections and becomings. This is why they should not be en-couraged, nor should we be rewarded for lingering around them too long. Negative passions are black holes. An ethics of affirmation involves the transformation of negative into positive passions: resentment into affirmation, as Nietzsche put it. The practice of transforming negative into positive passions is the process of reintroducing time, movement, and transformation into a stifling enclo-sure saturated with unprocessed pain. It is a gesture of affirmation of hope in the sense of affirming the possibility of moving beyond the stultifying effects of the pain, the injury, the injustice. This is a gesture of displacement of the hurt, which fully contradicts the twin logic of claims and compensation. This is achieved through a sort of de-personalization of the event, which is the ultimate ethical challenge. The displacement of the ego-indexed negative passions or affects reveals the fundamental senselessness of the hurt, the injustice, or injury one has suffered. “Why me?” is the refrain most commonly heard in situations of extreme dis-tress. This expresses rage as well as anguish at one’s ill fate. The answer is plain: for no reason at all. Examples of this are the banality of evil in large-scale genocides like the Holocaust (Arendt,1963), and the ran-domness of surviving them (think of Primo Levi who could/not endure his own survival). There is something intrinsically senseless about the pain or injustice: lives are lost or saved for all and no reason at all. Why did some go to work in the WTC on 9/11 while others missed the train? Why did Frida Kahlo take that tram which crashed so that she was impaled by a metal rod, and not the next one? For no reason at all. Reason has nothing to do with it. That is precisely the point. Contrary to the traditional morality that follows a rationalist and legalistic model of possible interpretation of the wrongs one suffered to a logic of responsibility, claim, and compensation, affirmative ethics rests on the notion of the random access to the phenomena that cause pain (or pleasure). This is not fatalism, and even less resignation, but rather amor fati. This is a crucial difference: we have to be worthy of what happens to us and rework it within an ethics of relation. Of course, repugnant and unbearable events do happen. Ethics consists, however, in reworking these events in the direction of positive relations. This is not carelessness or lack of compassion, but rather a form of lucidity that acknowledges the impossibility of finding an adequate answer to the question about the source, the origin, the cause of the ill fate, the painful event, the violence suffered. Acknowledging the futility of even trying to answer that question is a starting point. Edouard Glissant (1991) provides a perfect example of this productive ethics in his work on race and racism. An ethical relation cannot be based on resentment or resignation, but rather on the affirmation of positivity. Every event contains within it the potential for being overcome and overtaken; its negative charge can be transposed. The moment of the actualization is also the moment of its neutralization. “Every event is like death, double and impersonal in its double,” argues Deleuze (1990, 152). The free subject, the ethical subject is the one with the ability to grasp the freedom to depersonalize the event and transform its negative charge. The focus thus shifts to asking the adequate questions. Adequateness, both the logic of claim and compensation, lies at the heart of the ethical stance. This requires a double shift: of the pain itself—from the frozen or reactive effect to proactive affirmation—and of the line of questioning—from the quest for the origin or source to a process of elaboration of the kind of questions that express and enhance a subject’s capacity to achieve freedom through the understanding of its limitations. What is an adequate ethical question? One that is capable of sus-taining the subject in his/her quest for more interrelations with others, that is, more Life, motion, change, transformation, and potentia. The ad-equate ethical question provides the subject with a frame for interaction and change, growth and movement. It affirms life as difference-at-work. An ethical question had to be adequate in relation to how much a body can take, which is the notion of sustainability. How much can an em-bodied entity take in the mode of interrelations and connections, that is, how much freedom of action can we endure? That is the question. It assumes, following Nietzsche, that humanity does not stem from free-dom, but rather that freedom is extracted out of the awareness of lim-itations. Ethics is about freedom from the weight of negativity, freedom through the understanding of our bondage. A certain amount of pain, the knowledge about vulnerability and pain, is actually useful. It forces one to think about the actual material conditions of being interconnected and thus being in the world. It frees one from the stupidity of perfect health, and the full-blown sense of existential entitlement that comes with it. Paradoxically, it is those who have already cracked up a bit, those who have suffered pain and injury, who are better placed to take the lead in the process of ethical transformation. Because they are already on the other side of some existential divide, they are anomalous in some way —but in a positive way, for Deleuze (1969, 1988). Their anomaly deter-ritorializes the force of habit and introduces a powerful element of productive difference. They know about endurance, adequate forces, and the importance of Relations. Marxist epistemology and feminist standpoint theory have always acknowledged the privileged knowing position of those in the “margins.” Postcolonial theory displaces the dialectics of center-margin and locates the force of discursive production. Affirmative ethics is on the same wavelength: only those who have been hurt are in a position not to return the violence and hence make a positive difference. In order to do so, however, they have to become-minoritarian, that is, transcend the logic of negativity (claim and compensation) and transform the negative affect into something active and productive. The center being dead and empty of active force, it is on the margins that the processes of be-coming can be initiated. It is also crowded on the margins. he figure of Nelson Mandela—a contemporary secular saint—comes to mind, as does the world-historical phenomenon that is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in post-apartheid South Africa. This is a case of repetition that engenders difference and does not install the eternal return of revenge and negative affects, a massive exercise in trans-formation of negativity into something more livable, more life-enhancing. Christianity has tried to be here before. It has had an important input in the work of Cornell West, bell hooks, and other spiritually-minded acti-vists today, especially in reconstituting a sense of community and mutual responsibility in places devastated by hatred and mutual suspicion. Affirmative nomadic ethics is profoundly secular and it refuses simply to turn the other cheek. It proclaims the need to construct collectively positions of active, positive interconnections and relations that can sustain a web of mutual dependence, an ecology of multiple belongings. It is a case of extracting freedom from the awareness of limits. For the affirmative ethics of sustainability, it is always already a question of life and death. Being on the edge of too-muchness, or of unsus-tainability, surfing on the borders of the intolerable is another way of describing the process of becoming. Becoming marks a qualitative leap in the transformation of subjectivity and of its constitutive affects. It is a trip across different fields of perception, different spatio-temporal co-ordinates. Mostly it transforms negativity into affirmative affects: pain into compassion, loss into a sense of bonding, isolation into care. It is simultaneously a slowing down of the rhythm of daily frenzy and an acceleration of awareness, connection to others, self-knowledge and sen-sorial perception. Ethics includes the acknowledgment of and compassion for pain, as well as the activity of working through it. Any process of change must do some sort of violence to deeply engrained habits and dispositions which got consolidated in time. Overcoming these engrained habits is a nec-essary disruption, without which there is no ethical awakening. Con-sciousnessraising is not free of pain. The utterance: “I can’t take it anymore!” far from being an admission of defeat, marks the threshold and hence the condition of possibility for creative encounters and pro-ductive changes. This is how the ethical dimension appears through the mass of fragments and shreds of discarded habits that are characteristic of our times. The ethical project is not the same as the implementation of ruling standards of morality. It rather concerns the norms and values, the standards and criteria that can be applied to the quest for sus-tainable, that is to say for newly negotiated limits. Limits are to be rethought in terms of an ethics of becoming, through a non-Hegelian notion of “limits” as thresholds, that is to say points of encounter and not of closure, living boundaries and not fixed walls.",summarize the following text: ,"affirmation with its emphasis on moving across pain and transforming it into activity may seem counter-intuitive Great distress follows from not knowing or not being able to articulate the source of one’s suffering, or from knowing it all too well People who have been confronted by the irreparable will do anything to find solace this longing is commercially ex-ploited and its application to tracking of racial origins There is an incommensurability of the suffering involved for which no measure of compensation is possible a wound beyond repair logic of rights and reparation is not applicable ethics consists in accepting the impossibility of adequate compensation and living with the open wound contemporary culture has taken the opposite direction: it has favored morality based on the twin principles of claims and compensation as if financial settlements could provide the answer claims have been made by the descendants of slaves forcefully removed from Africa to North America ethics of affirmation is about suspending the quest for claims and compensation resisting retribution of rights Affirmation is not naive optimism It is about transformation its joyful affirmation as potentia which frames the boundaries of processes of becoming turning of the tide of negativity is the transformative process of achieving freedom through the awareness of our limits of our bondage results in the freedom to affirm one’s essence as joy through encounters with other bodies and forces A sub-ject thus constituted inhabits a time that is the active tense of continuous “becoming.” it also has a spatial side to do with the space of the body as an enfleshed field of actualization of passions it means putting up with hardship and physical pain. traumatic impact of painful events fixes them in a rigid, eternal present tense out of which it is difficult to emerge This is the eternal return of that which cannot be endured This introduces a temporal dimension into the discussion that leads to the very conditions of possibility of the future, to futurity as such expression of positive affects is that which makes the subject last This kind of ethics addresses the affective structure of pain and suffering but does not locate the ethical instance within it ethics is essentially about transformation of negative into positive passions, that is, about moving beyond the pain not mean denying the pain but rather activating it, working it through. negative affects can be transformed nomadic ethics puts the motion back into e-motion and the active back into activism, introducing movement, process, and becoming What is negative about negative affects is the effect of rigidification that comes as a result of an act of violence a trauma which can be self-perpetuated through practices that our culture simultaneously chastises as self-destructive and cultivates as a mode of discipline Abu-sive do not merely destroy the self but harm the self’s capacity to relate to others which is the key to a non- unitary and dynamic vision of the subject ethics of affirmation involves the transformation of resentment into affirmation transforming negative into positive passions is the process of reintroducing time into a stifling enclo-sure saturated with unprocessed pain It is a gesture of affirmation of hope in the sense of affirming the possibility of moving beyond the stultifying effects of the pain the injury This is a gesture of displacement of the hurt, which contradicts the twin logic of claims and compensation reveals the fundamental senselessness of injustice Why me?” is the refrain most commonly heard in situations of extreme dis-tress For no reason at all.

"In the following sections, I argue that in the effort to avoid the risk of legal cooptation, the current wave of suggested alternatives produces a mirror result of practical and conceptual cooptation. Three central types of difficulties exist with contemporary extra-legal scholarship. First, in the former contexts of the labor movement and the civil rights era, arguments about legal cooptation often developed in response to a perceived gap between the conceptual ideal toward which a social reform group struggles and its actual implementation. Paradoxically, in the contemporary message of opting out of traditional legal reforms avenues, this problem is in fact accentuated. As the move to such concepts as informalization -- moving to non-legal strategies, civil society – moving to extra-legal spheres, and pluralism -- the proliferation of norm-generating actors, has been developed and appropriated by supporters from a wide range of political commitments, these concepts have had unintended implications that are in conflict with the very social reform ideals from which they stem. Second, the idea of opting-out of the legal arena becomes self-defeating as it conceals the on-going importance of law and the possibilities of law reform in seemingly unregulated spheres. A model of exit and rigid sphere distinctions further fails to recognize a reality of increasing interpenetration and blurring of boundaries between private and public spheres; profit and non-profit sectors; and formal and informal institutions. It therefore loses the critical insight that understands law as operating in the background of seemingly unregulated relationships. Finally, the romantic notion of a privileged sphere, mode and means of action fails to develop tools for evaluating its success. If the critique of legal cooptation has involved the argument that legal reform, even when viewed as a victory, is never radically transformative, we must ask what are the criteria for assessing the achievements of the suggested alternatives? As shall be illustrated in the following sections, much of the current scholarship obscures the lines between the descriptive and the prescriptive in its exploration and formulation of social activism. If current suggestions present themselves as an alternative to formal legal struggles, we must question whether the new extra-legal politics that are proposed and celebrated are capable of producing a constructive theory and meaningful channels for reform, rather than passive status quo politics. Practical Failures: When Extra-Legal Alternatives Are Vehicles For Conservative Agendas We don’t want the 1950s back. We want to edit them. We want to keep the safe streets, the friendly grocers, and the milk and cookies, while blotting out the political bosses, the tyrannical headmasters, the inflexible rules, and the lectures on 100% Americanism and the sinfulness of dissent.135 A basic structure of cooptation arguments as developed in relation to the labor and civil rights movements has been to show how in the move from theory to practice, the ideal that was promoted by a social group receives unintended content, thus failing to realize the original vision. This is particularly true when concepts are framed in broad terms that are open to multiple interpretations. The pitfalls of the range of risks presented under the umbrella of cooptation are in fact accentuated in current proposals. Paradoxically, current suggestions that are framed by way of opposition to formal law reform paths risk precisely such cooptative meanings. Extra-legal paths are depicted mostly in negative terms, as resorting to alternative forms of action than former models. Accordingly, because the ideas of organizing, civil society and legal pluralism are framed in open-ended contrarian terms, they do not translate into specific visions of social justice reform. The case of civil society, which has been embraced by people from a broad array of, and indeed often conflicting, ideological commitments, is particularly demonstrative. As Alan Wolfe has argued, “some ideas fail because they never make the light of day. The idea of civil society…failed because it became too popular.”136 In former eras, the claims about the legal cooptation of the transformative visions of workplace justice and racial equality was that through legal strategies the vision became stripped from the initial depth; fragmented and framed in ways that were narrow and often merely symbolic. In the contemporary political map, the idea civil society revivalism has been evoked by progressive activists and subsequently reduced to symbolic acts with very little substance. On the left, progressive advocates envision the idea of decentralized activism in a third, non-governmental sphere as a way of reviving democratic participation and rebuilding the state from the bottom up. By contrast, the idea of civil society has been embraced by conservative politicians as a means for replacing government funded programs and steering away from state intervention. Subsequently, recent uses of civil society have subverted the ideals of progressive social reform and replaced them with conservative agendas that reject egalitarian ideals of social provision. In particular, recent calls to strengthen civil society have been advanced by politicians interested in the dismantling the modern welfare system. Conservative civil society revivalism often equates the idea of self-help through extra-legal means with traditional family structures, and blames the breakdown of those structures (e.g., the rise of the single parent family) for the increase in reliance and dependency on government aid.137 This recent depiction of the third sphere of civic life is averse to legal reform precisely because state intervention may support newer, non-traditional social structures. For conservative thinkers, legal reform also risks reifying increased dependency on social services by groups who have been traditionally marginalized, including disproportionate reliance on public funds by people of color and single mothers. Indeed, the end of “welfare as we knew it,”138 as well as transformation of “work as we knew it,”139 has led thinkers from all sides of the political spectrum to seek a third space that could replace the traditional functions of work and welfare. Paradoxically, a range of liberal and conservative visions have thus converged into the same agendas, such as the recent welfare-to-work reforms, which rely on a myriad of non-governmental institutions and activities to support these new arrangements.140 Drawing on the range of unbundled cooptation categories, it becomes evident that the limits of the contemporary extra-legal currant are multiple. First, there have been significant problems with resources and zero sum energies in recent campaigns surrounding community development and welfare. For example, the initial vision of welfare to work supported by liberal reformers was that of a multifaceted, dynamic system that would reshape the roles and responsibilities of welfare bureaucracy. President Clinton’s 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA)141 was designed to convert various welfare programs, including the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), into a single block grant program and to convert passive cash assistance into a more active welfare system, where individuals are to be better assisted, by both government and the community, to return to the labor force and find opportunities to support themselves.142 Yet, from the broader vision to actual implementation, the program quickly became limited in focus and in resources. PRWORA placed new limits on welfare provision by eliminating eligibility categories and by placing rigid time limits on provision of benefits. The need to frame the questions of poverty in institutional arrangements, professional jargon, and to comply with various funding block grants has made some issues such as statistical reduction of welfare recipients more salient in the reform, while other issues, such as the quality of jobs offered, have been largely eliminated from the policy thinking. Even those of aspects of the reform were hailed as empowering for those groups they were designed to help, 141 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, 1996, Public law 104-193, 110 STAT. 2105 (converting the Assistance for Family with Dependent Children (AFDC), the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program, and other welfare programs into a single block grant program to be used by states to provide cash and other benefits to individuals and families in need). 142 Barbara L. Bezdek, Contractual Welfare: Non-Accountability and Diminished Democracy in Local Government Contracts for Welfare-to-Work Services, 28 Fordham Urb. L.J. 1559, 1589 (2001). 48 like individual private training vouchers, there have been serious questions raised about the adequacy of the particular policy design when resources and institutional support are found lacking. As in the areas in the case of child care, health care, and educational vouchers, critiques worry that the most disadvantaged workers in the new market will not be able to take advantage of these reforms and that poverty will become the justification, rather than the goal, of these arrangements. In terms of classical cooptation critique, once reforms are envisioned, even when they need not be frame in legalistic terms, they in some ways become reduced to a handful of issues, while fragmenting, neglecting, and ultimately naturalizing other possibilities. At this point, the paradox of extra-legal activism unfolds. While public interest thinkers are increasingly embracing an axiomatic rejection of law as the primary form of progress, an embrace of a non-legal alternative presents parallel risks. The rejection of the “myth of the law/rights” is replaced by a “myth of activism” or the “myth of exit,” romanticizing a distinct sphere that can better solve social conflict. Yet, the myth, like other myths, comes complete with its own perpetual perils. The myth of exit exemplifies the myriad of concerns of cooptation. For feminist agendas for example, the separation of the world into distinct spheres of action has been a continuous impediment. Efforts to bring better possibilities for women to balance work and family responsibilities, including efforts to relax home work rules and to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation, have been couched in terms of support of individual choice and private decision making.143 Indeed, recent initiatives to support stay-at-home parents in federal childcare legislation have been clouded with preconceptions of the separation of spheres and the need to make one-or-the-other life choices. Most importantly, the 143 Nancy E. Dowd, Work and Family: Restructuring the Workplace, 32 Ariz. Law Rev. 431 (1990). 49 emergence of a sphere-oriented discourse abandons a critical perspective that distinguishes between valorizing traditionally gendered characteristics and celebrating feminine difference in a universalistic and essentialist manner.144 Not surprisingly then, some feminists writers have responded to civil society revivalism with great skepticism, arguing that efforts to align feminine values and agendas with classical republican theory of civil society activism should be understood at least in part as a way of legitimizing historical social structures in which women were traditionally subordinated.145 The feminist lesson surrounding the law/exit pendulum reveals a broader pattern. In a classic schematic analysis of cooptation, activists should in effect be concerned about the infusion (or indeed confusion) of non-legal strategies with conservative privatization agendas. In significant social policy contexts, legal scholarship oriented toward the exploration of extra-legal paths reinforces the exact narrative that is originally resisted -- that the state cannot and should not be accountable for sustaining and improving the lifeworld of individuals in the 21st century economy and that we must seek alternative ways to bring social reform. Whether described as a path-dependent process, an inevitable downward spiral, a transnational prisoner’s dilemma, or a necessary global race-to-the-bottom, in practice current analyses often suggest a lack of control vis-à-vis the forces of new economic realities. Rather than countering the story of lack of control, pointing to the on-going role of government, and showing the contradictions between that which is being kept regulated and that which is privatized, alternative extra-legal scholarship accepts these developments as natural and inevitable. Similarly to the 144 Judith Stacey, IN THE NAME OF THE FAMILY: RETHINKING FAMILY VALUES IN THE POSTMODERN AGE (1995). See also, Frances Olsen, The Family and the Market, Harv. L. Rev. 145 Nancy E. Dowd, WORK AND FAMILY: RESTRUCTURING THE WORKPLACE, 32 Ariz. L. Rev. 431, 486 (1990); Suzanna Sherry, Civic Virtue and the Feminine Voice in Constitutional Adjudication, 72 Virginia Law Rev. 543 (1986). 50 arguments developed in relation to the labor movement, where to focus on a limited right to collective bargaining demobilized workers and stripped them from their demands of voice, participation and decision making powers, contemporary agendas are limited to very narrow and patterned sets of reforms. A striking example has been the focus on welfare reform as the single frontier of economic redistribution without relating these reforms to on-going commitments to social services in which the middle class has a strong interest, such as Social Security and Medicare. Similarly, on the legal pluralism frontier, when activists call for more corporate social responsibility, the initial expressions are those of broad demands for ssustainable development and overall obligations of industry for the social and environmental consequences of their activities.146 The discourse however quickly becomes coopted with a shift to a narrow focus on charitable donations and corporate philanthrophy or private reporting absent an institutionalized compliance structure. Moreover, because of institutional limitations and crowding out effects, the focus quickly becomes thinking of the benefits of CSR to businesses, as a marketing, recruitment strategy, public relations and “greenwashing” strategies. Critics thereby become deeply cynical about the real commitments by industry actual motivations for ethical conduct. A similar process can be described with regard to the literature on globalization. Globalization scholarship often attempts to produce a unifying narrative and an image of unitary struggle when in fact such unity does not exist. Embodied in the aforementioned irony of a “global anti-globalization” movement, social reform activism that resides under the umbrella of global movements is greatly diverse, some of it highly conservative. An “anti-globalization movement” can be a defensive nationalist movement 146 World Business Council for Sustainable Development, CSR: Meeting Changing Expectations, 1999. 51 infused with xenophobia and protective ideologies.147 In fact, during central instances of collective action, such as those in Seattle, Quebec, Puerto Alegre, and Genoa, competing and conflicting claims have been frequently encompassed in the same momentary protest.148 Nevertheless, there is a tendency to celebrate and idealize these protests and infuse them with a world-altering image. Similarly, at the local level, grassroots politics often lack a clear agenda and are particularly ripe for cooptation processes whereby activists produce far lesser results than what may have been expected by the groups they represent. In a critical introduction of the Law and Organizing model, Cummings and Eagly, describe the ways in which new community-based approaches to progressive lawyering privilege grassroots movement politics over law reform efforts and privilege the facilitation of community mobilization over conventional lawyering. When the ways the ways in which law and organizing are currently embraced by community lawyers are carefully unpack, Cummings and Eagly rightfully warn against “exaggerating the ineffectiveness of traditional legal interventions” and “closing off potential avenues for redress.”149 Significantly, the strategies embraced by new public interest lawyers have not been demonstrated to produce effective change in the communities and certainly there has been no assurance that these strategies fair comparatively better than legal reform . Moreover, what are meant to be progressive projects of community action and community economic development can frequently entail an underlying effect of excluding worse-off groups, such as migrant workers, from their limited geographical 147 See Cecilia Lynch, Social Movements and the Problem of Globalization, 23 Alternatives 149 (1998); 148 Frederick M. Abbott, TRIPS in Seattle: The Not-So-Surprising Failure and the Future of the TRIPS Agenda, 18 Berkeley J. Int'l L. 165 (2000). 149 Id at 491. 52 scope.150 Again, like with the corporate social responsibility movement, and similarly to the ways critical scholars have assessed the decline of the labor movement framework through the embrace of a legal framework, a feature of the community economic development, which has become since the early 1990s a dominant approach to poverty relief, is its appeal to diverse ideological agendas.151 In all of these cases, it is the act of engagement, not law, which holds the risks of cooptation and the politics of compromise. It is not the particularities of lawyers as a professional group that creates dependency. Rather, it is the dynamics between skilled, networked and resourced components in the organization and those who need them that may submerge goals and create reliance. It is not the particularities of the structural limitations of the judiciary that threaten to limit the progressive vision of social movements. Rather, it is the essential difficulties of implementing theory into practice. Life is simply messier than any abstract ideals. Cooptation analysis exposes the broader risk of assuming ownership over a rhetorical and conceptual framework. Subsequently, when, in practice, others factions in the political debate embrace the language and frame their projects in similar terms, groups experience a sense of loss of control or possession of “their” vision. In the contemporary context, in the absence of a more programmatic concrete vision of what alternative models of social reform activism need to achieve, the conclusions and rhetoric of the contemporary critical legal consciousness are appropriated by a wide range of political commitments.

Rather, cooptation occurs when imagined ideals are left unchecked and seemingly progressive rhetoric is produced by a conservative agenda. Dominant meanings such as privatization and market competitiveness come ahead, while other meanings, such as progressive ideals including group empowerment and redistributive justice, serve to facilitate and stabilize the process.1",summarize the following text: ,"in the effort to avoid the risk of legal cooptation, the current wave of suggested alternatives produces a mirror result of practical and conceptual cooptation. arguments about legal cooptation often developed in response to a perceived gap between the conceptual ideal toward which a social reform group struggles the contemporary message of opting out of traditional legal reforms avenues this problem is in fact accentuated As the move to such concepts as informalization non-legal strategies, civil society proliferation of norm-generating actors these concepts have had unintended implications that are in conflict with the very social reform ideals from which they stem A model of exit and rigid sphere distinctions further fails to recognize a reality of increasing interpenetration and blurring of boundaries between private and public spheres; It therefore loses the critical insight that understands law as operating in the background of seemingly unregulated relationships. the romantic notion of a privileged sphere, mode and means of action fails to develop tools for evaluating its success . If current suggestions present themselves as an alternative to formal legal struggles, we must question whether the new extra-legal politics that are proposed and celebrated are capable of producing a constructive theory and meaningful channels for reform, rather than passive status quo politics. Practical Failures: When Extra-Legal Alternatives Are Vehicles For Conservative Agendas A basic structure of cooptation arguments as developed in relation to the labor and civil rights movements has been to show how in the move from theory to practice, the ideal that was promoted by a social group receives This is particularly true when concepts are framed in broad terms that are open to multiple interpretations current suggestions that are framed by way of opposition to formal law reform paths risk precisely such cooptative meanings civil society and legal pluralism are framed in open-ended contrarian terms, they do not translate into specific visions of social justice reform. legal cooptation of the transformative visions of workplace justice and racial equality was that through legal strategies the vision became stripped from the initial depth; , the idea civil society revivalism has been evoked by progressive activists and subsequently reduced to symbolic acts with very little substance progressive advocates envision the idea of decentralized activism in a third, non-governmental sphere as a way of reviving democratic participation and rebuilding the state from the bottom up the idea of civil society has been embraced by conservative politicians as a means for replacing government funded programs and steering away from state intervention recent uses subverted the ideals of progressive social reform replaced them with conservative agendas that reject egalitarian ideals of social provision. calls to strengthen civil society have been advanced by politicians interested in the dismantling the modern welfare system Conservative civil society revivalism often equates the idea of self-help through extra-legal means with traditional family structures For conservative thinkers, legal reform also risks reifying increased dependency on social services by groups who have been traditionally marginalized Paradoxically, a range of liberal and conservative visions have thus converged into the same agendas, such as the recent welfare-to-work reforms, which rely on a myriad of non-governmental institutions and activities to support these new arrangements At this point, the paradox of extra-legal activism unfolds. While public interest thinkers are increasingly embracing an axiomatic rejection of law as the primary form of progress an embrace of a non-legal alternative presents parallel risks The rejection of the “myth of the law/rights” is replaced by a “myth of activism” or the “myth of exit,” romanticizing a distinct sphere that can better solve social conflict. The myth of exit exemplifies the myriad of concerns of cooptation efforts to align feminine values and agendas with classical republican theory of civil society activism should be understood at least in part as a way of legitimizing historical social structures in which women were traditionally subordinated In a classic schematic analysis of cooptation, activists should in effect be concerned about the infusion ) of non-legal strategies with conservative privatization agendas legal scholarship oriented toward the exploration of extra-legal paths reinforces the exact narrative that is originally resisted the state cannot and should not be accountable for sustaining and improving the lifeworld her than countering the story of lack of control, pointing to the on-going role of government alternative extra-legal scholarship accepts these developments as natural and inevitable Globalization scholarship often attempts to produce a unifying narrative and an image of unitary struggle when in fact such unity does not exist reform activism that resides under the umbrella of global movements is greatly diverse, some of it highly conservative. infused with xenophobia and protective ideologies grassroots movement politics over law reform efforts and privilege the facilitation of community mobilization over conventional lawyering When the ways the ways in which law and organizing are currently embraced by community lawyers are carefully unpack, warn against “exaggerating the ineffectiveness of traditional legal interventions” and “closing off potential avenues for redress.” the strategies have not been demonstrated to produce effective change in the communities and no assurance that these strategies fair comparatively better than legal reform it is the act of engagement, not law, which holds the risks of cooptation and the politics of compromise.

"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"
"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.
As such, the allied forces would need a margin of error. They would also need to operate in a sufficiently dispersed way that they limited their vulnerability to a single nuclear burst or two. In rough terms, a weapon of Hiroshima or Nagasaki force could severely damage most vehicles out to about half a mile to a mile distance and kill or severely injure most people out to 2 to 3 kilometers from ground zero, below the point of detonation.35 In a major offensive, a modern military might concentrate its forces such that a brigade was placed every 5 to 10 kilometers within a general zone of advance.36 That might not be prudent in a potentially nuclear environment.
On balance, in light of the normal geographic zones over which advancing mechanized forces generally would operate, it is prudent to assume that perhaps a brigade of unsuspecting Combined Forces Command ground forces plus corresponding support could be destroyed or severely degraded for each nuclear weapon used. This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency. Some fraction of those could be South Korean reservists, but this kind of concern again validates the case for a robust American contribution to the allied war capability of at least the size discussed above. Indeed, a 250,000-strong U.S. force, with up to 175,000 of them Army and Marine Corps personnel, is hardly an excessive estimate of the U.S. military personnel that might be needed in such a scenario.
The China Dimension
How would China likely respond to all of this? The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement. Why implicate itself in the mistakes of the world’s last bastion of Stalinism? Why risk direct war with the United States? The idea that the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in its modern guise would behave in a manner analogous to what Mao had done in the early days of the cold war would seem to smack of absurdity.
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by. Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea. And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy.37 Creating a buffer zone 50 or 100 kilometers into North Korea might appeal. In short, there are reasons to think the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) might wish to intervene in a Korea contingency.38
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse. Beyond concerns about border security, Chinese leaders could be thinking about post conflict force dispositions on the peninsula. Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility. This scenario is particularly credible in light of two Chinese views. The first view is that an American military presence on the Asian mainland is inimical to the long-term Chinese interests of creating a greater sphere of influence and security for itself while avoiding encirclement by a pro-U.S. coalition.39 The second is that Korea historically falls within any such Chinese sphere as a “tributary” state.40
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context. Beijing’s argument, explicit or implicit, might be that it would of course be happy to remove its troops from Korean soil once the peninsula was against stable—provided that the United States agreed to remove its own forces as well. Such a motivation might lead China to seek to deploy its forces further south than was required for a border-related operation, and perhaps to employ larger numbers of troops than it otherwise would have. It is also possible that China would hope to retain some kind of rump North Korean state after hostilities, as a buffer between itself and the United States and Republic of Korea, even if it recognized that such a North Korean state could require a new government.
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea. The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times include the DF-21 antiship ballistic missile, Kilo attack submarines and Sovremenny destroyers purchased from Russia, aircraft, including the J-11B and J-20 and perhaps now the J-31 too, and the PLA’s first operational aircraft carrier, the Liaoning.41 But while the overall thrust of these and other programs is probably to address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific, a number of the relevant systems, including the aircraft, could also be very helpful in a major overland operation. More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades, making it an even more formidable potential foe on the peninsula than it was from 1950 through 1953. In recent times it has emphasized greater use of information, combined-arms and joint operations, and mobility, while improving training and logistics as well. The PLA still has a way to go in many of these areas, of course.42 That said, even before all these recent innovations and improvements, it showed in the 1950s that it was well capable of deploying large forces to the Korean Peninsula.
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster. That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Some hard-liners in both South Korea and the United States could be expected to call for a firm, even forceful response by Combined Forces Command to such a Chinese encroachment.43 Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could also result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash.
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated. As the scholar Andrew Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis”—meaning it has not been sobered by a deeply unsettling and frightening experience.44 Overconfidence could result. So could an inadequate appreciation of the dangers of war, or a hope that new technologies would permit shorter and more decisive wars than in the past—a tendency of many militaries and many leaders over the generations.45
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination. The United States and the Republic of Korea should consider that a Chinese role in a future Korea scenario might in fact be helpful rather than threatening. It could lower the risks of inadvertent war. It could also reduce U.S. and ROK troop requirements for stabilizing the northern part of North Korea and provide reassurance to the North Korean people that their legitimate interests would be protected in a unified Korea. China has too much to gain from prior coordination with the Republic of Korea and the United States, although this would necessarily need to be highly confidential, given the likely anxiety it would cause in Pyongyang.
But none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability, including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly. The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea. Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war. Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase. This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets, for a net strength of some 250,000 GIs, as argued earlier. Again, the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario.",summarize the following text: ,"North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces

"Alternatively, as envisioned in the 5029 plans developed by the Combined Forces Command in Seoul, North Korean collapse or another type of internal chaos could create a situation of unrest adequate to justify a major response by ROK and American forces. This might result largely from fear that the DPRK’s nuclear materials could wind up in the wrong hands.32
Either one of these scenarios could lead to a major conflict. Large elements of North Korea’s million-man armed forces, and ultimately many reservists, would be pitted against South Korea’s half-million-strong active duty military, the nearly 30,000 American troops in Korea, and a similar number perhaps from Japan (though some of the American forces now in Japan would surely stay there to help with the protection of Japan itself, as well as with logistical support and possible refugee issues related to the Korean conflict). Over time, Korean reservists and U.S. reinforcements would enter the fight as well. The latter might ultimately number in the hundreds of thousands, depending on the course of the conflict. The presumed goals for the Combined Forces Command would be to eliminate the North Korean threat to South Korea in general and Seoul in particular in the first instance, to neutralize the North Korean army, and to control the territory and population centers of North Korea, with an eye toward restoring order while also securing weapons of mass destruction. These goals would probably be most realistically achieved by also overthrowing the North Korean government.
There would be a premium on rapid and substantial American response in this case. Some argue that today’s military balance on the Korean Peninsula no longer necessitates significant contributions by U.S. ground forces. They assert that, with South Korea’s military just over half a million strong and North Korea’s twice that size but far less well prepared, the South now has military superiority over the DPRK and can handle any conflict on its own without much more than U.S. airpower in support. The logic of this thinking is part of what has driven the idea that Operational Command of Combined Forces can change, with the United States no longer playing the top role in an integrated hierarchy but the two sides essentially sharing different elements of the command responsibilities in any conflict. However, this thinking is flawed. North Korea’s nuclear capacities, combined with its preexisting conventional forces, put a premium on rapid and comprehensive defeat of the DPRK regime—quite likely necessitating a major U.S. role and a tightly integrated allied effort.
To apply the Dupuy method here, I begin by assuming that South Korea has a military edge over the North comparable to what Israel has had against Arab neighbors over recent decades, roughly 3:1 in quality. I further assume that North Korea enjoys no net benefit from surprise (that is, any North Korean benefit of surprise would be modest and at least offset by allied forces’ advantages in fighting from defensive positions). Nor do I assume that either Korea benefits from its many reservists, if the scenario is an attack on South Korea, since those reservists are generally not equipped with a great deal more equipment than small weaponry and take some time to mobilize. The calculation is then:
South Korean Power: (500,000)(3)(1) = 1,500,000
North Korean Power: (1,000,000)(1)(1) = 1,000,000
South Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(500,000)(1,000,000/1,500,000) = 3,667 per day
North Korean Loss Rate: (.01)(1,000,000)(1,500,000/1,000,000) = 15,000 per day
By this calculus, even with the Untied States left out entirely, South Korea successfully defends its own territory, in that its daily casualty rate is only about one-fourth of North Korea’s and it begins with a force half as large. And again, this is meant as a conservative calculation from the point of view of the U.S. allies.
However, this assumes a protracted war of attrition during which Seoul could be bombarded repeatedly—and after which the North Korean regime would likely remain in place. Neither of these circumstances is likely to be acceptable to Seoul or Washington. A counterattack by allied forces into North Korea would likely be their response, not a simple defensive holding action.
In any ROK-U.S. counterattack, North Korea’s 6 million reservists could come into the equation. They are poorly equipped, but many are well indoctrinated and likely to be tenacious.
North Korea’s nuclear arsenal creates huge uncertainties for the analysis. Above, I assumed that it would not be used in an attack on South Korea, perhaps out of fear of retaliation. But if allied forces moved northward towards Pyongyang, North Korean calculations could change, and incentives to employ nuclear weapons could grow. Might the DPRK then use a nuclear weapon or two to blow a hole in allied defenses in one sector of the front lines by using an airburst that would minimize fallout—and thus permit fairly rapid North Korean exploitation of the subsequent weakness in Combined Forces lines? Nuclear attack to generate electromagnetic pulse to damage U.S. and ROK electronics would also be plausible.
The American Dimension
These latter considerations would put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces. While South Korea has a fine army—perhaps one of the five best in the world, in quantity and quality—its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited. As such, and as the above Dupuy equations imply, its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition. But that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role (see below).
Thus, an American maneuver capability would be hugely advantageous. It could in theory help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart. It could also help create the capacity for a victory achieved less by defeat in detail of the enemy than by a pincer movement that would cut off many of its forces from their leadership and capital. The U.S. force could be spearheaded by the 101st Air Assault division, with its helicopter mobility, and by a U.S. Marine division deploying by amphibious ships and maritime prepositioning ships. It could further include an army division or more also marrying up with equipment from prepositioning ships and deploying by fast sealift. Together, this would constitute a corps-level capability that would be robust against North Korean counterattack even when deployed on North Korean soil.
Such a U.S. force would have a size of up to 150,000 ground forces, perhaps, and be complemented by another 75,000 naval and air personnel. They could thus possess a combined power by the Dupuy equations of 2,250,000—assuming a quality advantage of 10:1 against DPRK soldiers, not unlike what was observed in U.S. air-ground engagements against Iraqi forces in recent decades. This could be roughly equal the realistic capacities of those 6 million North Korean reservists, many of whom might never make it to the fight and most of whom might not fight well—but nonetheless a force whose sheer numbers require some degree of balancing by the allies.
The Nuclear Dimension
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal. American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability, as well as a hedge in the event that North Korean use of weapons of mass destruction complicated any conventional effort. But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal. First of all, given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country, according to standard deterrent logic. Perhaps they could be told that, while their unseating from power was the inevitable goal of any such military effort, they might be spared the death penalty or even offered eventual asylum if they desisted from such abominable actions. Yet the credibility of such a pledge in the middle of wartime operations could be difficult to establish. Moreover, North Korean leaders might really think that by using a nuclear weapon or two in a battlefield mode to slow an advancing army, while implicitly or explicitly threatening the use of other nuclear weapons against Seoul, they might find a credible pathway toward a negotiated settlement. Former Combined Forces commander General B. B. Bell has argued persuasively that to think North Korea would be fundamentally averse to using its nuclear weapons in war is wishful thinking, were regime survival on the line, especially when one bears in mind that the United States itself used nuclear weapons in the past.33
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces or other targets might not be a full answer to the dilemma either. Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets such as airfields, major ports, highways, and command centers as the Combined Forces would be. The North Korean nuclear strikes might be airbursts near key military assets and units, detonated high enough to avoid the creation of large amounts of fallout—that is, at roughly 1,700 to 1,800 feet of altitude, as with the roughly 20-kiloton Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs.34 To achieve comparable effects, the United States might need to employ a dozen or more nuclear weapons of its own. It would have the capacity to do this, to be sure, but might not have the will in light of the likely repercussions in terms of human costs and in broader political and strategic terms. It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation. Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited as well, and U.S. force planning would therefore wisely proceed from the assumption that the key response to North Korean nuclear aggression would be conventional.

This is a very notational and rough estimate, clearly. But assuming a rough rule of 10,000 allied forces lost for every North Korean nuclear weapon employed is probably a reasonable guide. As such, perhaps 30,000 to 50,000 additional allied troops should be built into planning requirements to cover this contingency.

These considerations put a premium on U.S. maneuver forces While South Korea has a fine army its capacities for amphibious and aerial movement are limited its success in a future war would likely be largely a matter of defeating North Korean forces in detail by attrition that approach would allow lots of time for North Korean fissile materials to move about, for North Korean reservists to be mobilized, for Seoul to be threatened, and for China to weigh multiple options for its own role
Thus, an American maneuver capability would help secure the perimeter of much of North Korean territory, to make it hard for nuclear weapons and fissile materials and any leaders bent on escape to depart
Further reinforcing the case for a strong U.S. capability of the size and type outlined above is the North Korean nuclear arsenal American nuclear weapons would provide a strong deterrent against this capability But it is too simple to assume that U.S. nuclear weapons would fully counter and checkmate any possible North Korean employment of the DPRK’s own nuclear arsenal given the presumed stakes in this scenario—overthrow of the North Korean regime—there is little reason to think that DPRK leaders would be dissuaded from resorting to any and all means of halting an invasion of their country
Simply retaliating with nuclear weapons, in a proportionate manner against North Korean forces might not be a full answer to the dilemma either Beyond the humanitarian implications, it is doubtful that North Korea’s armed forces would be as concentrated geographically or dependent on specific targetable assets It also might wish, initially at least, to withhold use of nuclear weapons in order to deter further North Korean escalation Perhaps most credibly, it could use a nuclear weapon or two in response to signal to Pyongyang that it would not be intimidated from responding in kind, but it might choose the location of the attack in such a way as to minimize the lethal effects, especially on civilians. This might mean that the military benefits would be limited
The presumption among many American analysts has been that, recognizing North Korea as the chief source of the conflict, China would do everything possible to limit its own involvement
However, there are reasons to be concerned that China would not simply stand by Fearing refugee flows, if not the leakage of nuclear or chemical materials from the DPRK, China might wish to seal its border with North Korea And if protecting the border were the goal, doing so from a forward position could strike many Chinese military minds as sound policy
Chinese decisionmaking would also be influenced by assessment of the longer-term consequences of North Korea’s collapse Expecting that the United States might try to retain forces in Korea even after reunification and stabilization efforts were complete, they might seek to establish leverage against that possibility
Creating a fait accompli of tens of thousands (or more) of Chinese troops on Korean territory might seem a good bargaining chip in this context
China’s military modernization efforts in recent years have focused more on maritime domains, but a number of its programs could empower—and perhaps embolden—PRC leaders to consider a direct role in a conflict in Korea The most notorious Chinese programs in modern times address disputed territories and waterways in the western Pacific a number of the relevant systems could also be very helpful in a major overland operation More generally, China’s army has been streamlined and professionalized in recent decades
A PLA intervention in Korea could be a prescription for disaster That is especially true as the U.S. and Chinese militaries have had very little contact or discussion about Korea over the years. Inadvertent escalation owing to miscommunication or the assertive actions of local commanders could result. Even if top-level political leaders did not advocate or authorize it, any ambiguity they conveyed in their orders might allow a direct clash
For a Chinese military that has not gone to war in a generation, it is possible that the dangers of combat might be downplayed or underappreciated As Erickson has pointed out, the modern Chinese military has not gone through its own version of a “Cuban missile crisis Overconfidence could result
The above considerations also suggest that both sides not only have much to lose by failure to coordinate their response to crisis, but indeed, might have a lot to gain through coordination
none of this sort of cooperative endeavor can work absent a strong American capability including the capacity to deploy corps-scale forces rapidly The United States need to be in a strong position vis-a-vis China to maintain the kind of leverage and influence required to make collaboration with the PLA a truly sound idea Beijing should not gain the perception that it would be the most important and influential outside player in a future Korean war Should China come to such a conclusion, its incentives for asserting its own prerogative to act as it saw fit might increase This logic provides additional grounds for favoring a U.S. capacity for Korea in the range of a corps of ground forces—three to four divisions, plus support—complemented by substantial airpower and other assets the logic is not to assume the need to defeat China in battle, only to have Seoul and Washington in a strong position to set the main parameters by which the PLA might credibly contribute to a positive outcome in a future war scenario"
"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"

The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"
"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.

"Zhu Feng, Professor at the School of International Studies at Peking University and Deputy Director at the Center for International and Strategic Studies, 7/19/13, “China and the United States Might Not Be Heading for a “New Cold War”” http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/ Chinese military modernization and the PLA’s new “AD/A2” military capability have greatly changed traditional strategy toward a potential threat from the PLA. There has been a mounting possibility of Sino-US conflict in the West Pacific as the number of “flash points” has increased. The Taiwan Strait is not the only potential flashpoint, with the recent addition of the Yellow Sea, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea. It is widely believed that the PLA is heavily motivated, by seeking the AD/A2 capability, to reduce American entry and undercut its access to potential “hot spots,” which China, arguably, has already mapped out. To desperately keep the US military away from these “hot spots,” Beijing seems to be attempting to bully its “small neighbors” and pushing a solution to its own advantage, HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""4"" 4 arguably, on the basis of this new capability that some perceive as nearing US capability in the region.” HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""5"" 5 The PLA’s AD/A2, combined with the perception of China’s expansionist ambitions, presumably constitutes the main source of regional instability. Some argue that the military buildup is the long-lasting attempt by Beijing to break the American encirclement. As long as the United States steadfastly pursues its forward military deployment in the Asia-Pacific, Beijing will hardly slow its pace to restrain US access through military modernization. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""6"" 6 China’s AD/A2 capability and its sequential access-denial strategy significantly raise US strategic concerns, and the Strategic Guidance for 2020, a cornerstone defense document issued in January 2012, unequivocally states that one of the leading threats for the United States in the Asia-Pacific is the prospect of gravely limited access and entry, HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""7"" 7 catastrophically undermining the credibility and dependability of its security commitment in the region. By all standards, these robust security commitments have been an anchor of the region’s peace and prosperity. How big is the PLA’s AD/A2 capability and how imminent is the threat to American strategic objectives? So far there are no consistent and convincing answers. For example, the PLA’s DF 21 middle-range missile is regarded as an “aircraft carrier killer,” but how effective would it be? There are rather contradictory assessments. Any argument about its effect in scaring off US military entry would be a pure denial of conventional wisdom that attacking a US carrier group would summon more aircraft carriers and even force an open war between Washington and Beijing., raising the question of whether Beijing would contemplate a military showdown between two powers. AD/A2 originally stems from the PLA’s acute anxiety about the credibility of its military deterrence capabilities against Taiwan’s independence drift. With the Taiwan issue gradually easing since 2008, the PLA’s military advances are proceeding steadily, purporting to go beyond Taiwan in order to support military counter-measures for diverse security requests such as maritime security, territorial disputes, and perhaps most importantly, grappling with American strategic supremacy in the Asia-Pacific. The PLA’s military modernization, despite two decades of double-digit increases in defense spending, has not nearly eliminated the spending gap with the United States, allowing Washington to maintain its military and strategic superiority The huge military power disparity between the United States and China is sufficient to impose “structural constraint” on China’s international behavior. With the concept of “Air-Sea Battle” on the horizon, the United States is fortifying its cutting edge in the military field. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""8"" 8 Despite unwavering dissatisfaction with American hegemony, Beijing has no intention of challenging US military and strategic preponderance in the Asia-Pacific, and, perhaps unwittingly but realistically, enjoys its self-definition as a developing power. The PLA’s AD/A2 capability, in essence, is passive and defensive. Though it might complicate US strategic calculations in the region, it remains far from a “game changer” in the regional security posture of the two. The AD/A2 capability cannot function independent of the total US-China power disparity. The fear of it decisively metastasizing China’s regional security strategy has been overstated. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""9"" 9 What has been the impact of “rebalancing” on military interactions between Beijing and Washington? A nationalist barrage in the Chinese media and “loose cannons” among PLA scholars condemn this strategic adjustment as an “American conspiracy” aimed at “containing” and “encircling” China, but Beijing’s official response seems quite reasonable. No one in the government or the PLA is rebuking the “rebalancing” in that way. Instead, the Chinese Foreign Ministry is not disinclined to use the Chinese translation of “pivoting” or “rebalancing” rather than persisting in invoking the Chinese term “returning to Asia”—an obsolete usage for Obama’s Asian policy from the early days of his presidency. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""10"" 10 Likewise, Beijing seems to prefer to seal its lips, dramatically in contrast to the media’s hyperbole. According to my observations, the official quiet towards America’s high profile “rebalancing” rests on a two-fold calculation. First, the Chinese leadership understands that “rebalancing” is inevitable. The effects of China’s rise on the global and Asia-Pacific regional order are expected to be the main preoccupation of the United States in particular and the West in general; so it is fruitless to complain. In fact, US balancing of China is by no means a novelty since the end of the Cold War. Second, the Hu Jintao government has been emphatic on a “stable, healthy, and cooperative” relationship with its American counterparts. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""11"" 11 Officially blasting the United States would have poisoned the political climate, shadowed the foreign policy legacy of his government, and even worse, undermined the power base when leadership reshuffling approached. The Xi Jinping government proposes “a new type of great power relations,” seeing “cooperation and win-win” relations with Washington as central in handling thorny issues. Unnerved by the US “rebalancing” push, Beijing pragmatically assumes that there is no credible proof that Washington has fundamentally altered its policy or is projecting a historic turnaround to fully confront China. Therefore, the “balancing” moves do not ring an alarmist bell to force China to overhaul its “peaceful rise” assurances. Growing assertiveness in Chinese responses to territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea has little to do with Beijing’s calculus toward “rebalancing,” and, instead, has more to do with domestic political imperatives. Fearing a domestic backlash from its “weakness” in handing territorial disputes, the leadership seeks a mandate to take up a number of “hardliner choices” to placate the domestic audience. The Scarborough Shoal frictions with Manila is a case at hand. Many Chinese thought that the Philippine resort to a warship to check Chinese fishing boats in April 2012 gave Beijing legal authorization to respond with naval force. However, because of the pointlessness of escalating the shoal spat into a military confrontation, Beijing invented the “Scarborough Shoal pattern”—using surveillance ships to block Philippine boats from accessing it. Beijing wanted to duplicate the “Scarborough shoal pattern” on the 2nd Tom Shoal in June 2013, but at the last minute, it acquiesced to the Philippines’ occupation of the shoal. This demonstrates that the Xi Jinping administration really does not want to extend the fire line, though such provocations would win applause domestically, even as they precipitated a diplomatic standoff between Beijing and Manila. Ironically, America’s “rebalancing” moves stiffened Chinese resolve to enhance diplomatic and political contacts with US counterparts rather than recalibrating policy rivaling the United States. The tougher posture of the United States towards China dramatically binds both more tightly to diplomatic pragmatism rather than military antagonism. 2012 witnessed a couple of potentially explosive events which might have jeopardized the relationship—Wang Lijun’s sneaking into the US Consulate at Chengdu in March, and Chen Guancheng’s asylum-seeking at the US diplomatic compound in Beijing in April. These two “hot potatoes” might have caused a downward spiral in relations if mismanaged, but, fortunately, both sides sought to reach a solution through “quiet diplomacy.” As for the escalating tension from territorial disputes, China and the United States maintain routine contacts to channel information to prevent miscalculation. Thus, the “rebalancing” moves do not inevitably stir up new tensions. Instead, Beijing and Washington dramatically hold on to a higher level of strategic prudence: the Obama administration repeatedly tones down “targeting China” nuances, and harps on the necessity of cooperation; meanwhile, China is trying to dodge America’s flexing of its strategic muscles, and to avoid tit-for-tat confrontations. The Complexity of Territorial Disputes in East Asia: New Breeding Grounds for War? Steady systematic, rescheduled balancing of power cannot entirely reign in China’s behavior. Beijing’s intention to not challenge the United States does not automatically suggest that it would comport with outside expectations of its behavior, and, moreover, it hardly translates into full-flung political enthusiasm to behave itself. If both sides are less cautious, the military tensions might creep up rather than edge down. It is understood that given China’s reduced flexibility in handling territorial disputes, US concern about Chinese use of military force to coerce a solution in China’s favor has significantly deepened. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""12"" 12 In support of the credibility and dependability of the US security commitment to the region, the Pentagon has obviously felt more compelled to prepare for military intervention, if necessary, and thus, the probability of a China-US military collision has accordingly soared. What motivates China and the United States to resort to force in the territorial disputes? Will the disputes inevitably entail military collision between the two? One reason to be concerned about war is China’s tendency to declare sovereignty issues a “core interest,” warranting Beijing to do whatever it takes. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""13"" 13 The extended explanation of China’s alleged “core interests” in 2010 aroused considerable controversy, and it has proven to be a flawed approach for reiterating its prolonged and contentious territorial claims. But we have to discern between the Chinese political desire to harden its stance and its real preference to tackle the territorial disputes. Labeling Chinese claims “core interests” is, by and large, a way for Beijing to duck diplomatic resilience rather than an assertion of the military salience of finding a solution. Furthermore, no one could exclude the possibility that Beijing would use force even if it had not declared territorial issues “core interests.” At least so far, there is no sign that China has decided on the application of military force to seek any solution in the South China Sea. On the contrary, it is rarely indicated that the use of force against Vietnam or the Philippines would be a smart and operable idea to address their competing claims over the Spratly Islands and the Paracel Islands. Xi Jingping urges the PLA to prepare for war, and particularly for winning war, HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""14"" 14 but his words have been widely explained in a domestic context as alluding to military prudence: don’t aim to use military force unless a winning fight can be assured. The Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands issue might be quite different from the South China Sea. Most Chinese can accept a political solution over the Spratly disputes, but are less likely to call for the same solution in the East China Sea if Japanese politicians continue to sweep relations with China into the mentality of revisionism. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""15"" 15 We should be wary of underestimating the potential of a military conflict between China and Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. It is a broadly shared perception in China that Ishihara Shintaro’s proposal to purchase the islands and the Noda administration’s “nationalization” were designed to play the “China card” in Japanese domestic politics, purporting to hurt China, given the backdrop of the US “rebalancing” and Tokyo’s political and economic paralysis. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""16"" 16 Along with lingering and daunting “history problems” between Beijing and Tokyo, this speck in the East China Sea might spark a military conflict. It appears that Beijing does not want to risk overwhelming 40 years of Sino-Japan relations to struggle for that geographically trivial spot, but things will get out of control if Tokyo dispatches its naval force to intercept or forcefully drive away Chinese surveillance ships around that island. In that case, the US military deterrence might help to de-escalate the confrontation, but dispatching two aircraft carriers to the West Pacific Rim would hardly make the opposing sides calm down. HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""17"" 17 Neither the South China Sea nor the East China Sea would involve an amphibious landing even if military conflict mistakenly erupted. Even if a territorial dispute would tragically lead to a military conflict, it is assumed to be limited, brief, and manageable. Concern about consequential China-US military combat is deemed to be pointless. New American Security fellow Oriana S. Mastro concludes that China’s reactions in the South China Sea are “exemplary interagency coordination, civil-military control, and harmonization of its political, economic and military objectives.” HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""18"" 18 Faced with its domestic audience, Chinese leaders do not want to lose popularity by backing off, but that does not suggest military escalation, even if its “assertive” military posture over the territorial disputes is definitely regarded as “targeting” the United States. The US factor has proven to successfully modify China’s policy choices in many of the territorial disputes. As Jonathan Pollack notes, “although China is focused heavily on enhancing its political-strategic position across the entire Asia-Pacific region, the management of its relations with the US remains a singular policy preoccupation.” HYPERLINK ""http://www.theasanforum.org/china-and-the-united-states-might-not-be-heading-for-a-new-cold-war/"" \l ""19"" 19 Yet, China’s moderation does not result from US influence alone. There is also a ceiling effect Beijing finds no way to break, and also China’s massive regional economic integration and rising dependency on the regional market and natural resources. After the sea confrontations with the Philippines in 2012 and Vietnam in 2011, Beijing has been highly aware of the significance of how it addresses its claims in the disputed area. It risks squandering the accumulation of 20 years of “good neighbor” relations and incurring serious erosion of China’s political and economic interests with ASEAN. The PLA’s nascent AD/A2 capability does not signify real motivation for carrying out military coercion in the Asia-Pacific. Conceivably, the Spratly Islands are out of the J-10’s patrolling radius. Even mid-air refueling will not safeguard success in a theater of war over these islands. Reality ultimately frames Chinese choice in these territorial disputes. Beijing’s surprising agreement to launch negotiation with ASEAN countries over a code of conduct in the South China Sea is recent evidence. No war and yes relations The China-US relationship has been structurally predictable, but domestically volatile. Given US military supremacy and regional preponderance, Beijing has little feasible choice to challenge them in the foreseeable future. However, it will not stop a search for its own security in the shadow of American primacy. The Chinese media are normally infested with anti-American comments, and the PLA in particular sounds bellicose over issues like Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the East China Sea. But this does not necessarily mean that the Chinese leadership prefers to see ups and downs in its ties with the United States. Rather, Beijing’s preferred template, consistent since the end of the Cold War, remains intact. It is to maintain a productive, cooperative, and stable relationship with the United States, even if it may be described as “important but complicated” or being in the “same bed but dreaming differently.” The Xi-Obama summit at Sunnylands highlighted the urgency of discussing challenging issues in a manner that is more personal, honest, and productive. The Xi Jinping government, I contend, will turn out to be more pragmatic and decisive than his predecessors in managing Beijing-Washington frictions. It stems partly from the leadership’s reasoned estimate of the damaging consequences of the alternative policy of “standing up,” and partly from awareness that an escalation of tension, even if restricted to the diplomatic arena, might lead to a wider breach in the bilateral relationship. Domestic issues will likely drive Xi’s agenda, but he will be more personably engaged in China’s foreign policy than earlier leaders. Xi is quite clear that his main challenges mostly come from internal rather than external problems. Stabilization of China-US relations will certainly help in tackling accumulated domestic problems, ranging from inequities and corruption to environmental degradation and social unrest. But designating becoming a maritime power (haiyang qiangguo) as its strategic goal will lead Beijing to expand its maritime presence incrementally. The territorial disputes unnecessarily highlight this process and also tarnish the image of China’s rise. Beijing should be highly aware of such risks, but skillful diplomacy, rather than militarization in the Asia-Pacific by the American side is desirable in shaping China’s choice. Thus, the genie of a “new cold war” would be safely kept in the bottle. America’s Air-Sea Battle Concept",summarize the following text: ,"Chinese military modernization and the PLA’s new “AD/A2” military capability have greatly changed traditional strategy toward a potential threat from the PLA It is widely believed that the PLA is heavily motivated, by seeking the AD/A2 capability, to reduce American entry and undercut its access to potential “hot spots Some argue that the military buildup is the long-lasting attempt by Beijing to break the American encirclement. As long as the United States steadfastly pursues its forward military deployment in the Asia-Pacific, Beijing will hardly slow its pace to restrain US access through military modernization the leading threats for the United States in the Asia-Pacific is the prospect of gravely limited access and entry catastrophically undermining the credibility and dependability of its security commitment in the region. By all standards, these robust security commitments have been an anchor of the region’s peace and prosperity. AD/A2 originally stems from the PLA’s acute anxiety about the credibility of its military deterrence capabilities against Taiwan’s independence drift the PLA’s military advances are proceeding steadily, purporting to go beyond Taiwan in order to support military counter-measures for diverse security requests such as maritime security, territorial disputes, and perhaps most importantly, grappling with American strategic supremacy in the Asia-Pacific The huge military power disparity between the United States and China is sufficient to impose “structural constraint” on China’s international behavior. With the concept of “Air-Sea Battle” on the horizon, the United States is fortifying its cutting edge in the military field Despite unwavering dissatisfaction with American hegemony, Beijing has no intention of challenging US military and strategic preponderance in the Asia-Pacific, What has been the impact of “rebalancing” on military interactions between Beijing and Washington? A nationalist barrage in the Chinese media and “loose cannons” among PLA scholars condemn this strategic adjustment as an “American conspiracy” aimed at “containing” and “encircling” China, but Beijing’s official response seems quite reasonable. No one in the government or the PLA is rebuking the “rebalancing” in that way. Instead Beijing seems to prefer to seal its lips, dramatically in contrast to the media’s hyperbole the official quiet towards America’s high profile “rebalancing” rests on a two-fold calculation. the Chinese leadership understands that “rebalancing” is inevitable. The effects of China’s rise on the global and Asia-Pacific regional order are expected to be the main preoccupation of the United States in particular and the West in general; so it is fruitless to complai . In fact, US balancing of China is by no means a novelty since the end of the Cold War. the Hu Jintao government has been emphatic on a “stable, healthy, and cooperative” relationship with its American counterparts Officially blasting the United States would have poisoned the political climate, shadowed the foreign policy legacy of his government, and even worse, undermined the power base when leadership reshuffling approached The Xi Jinping government proposes “a new type of great power relations,” seeing “cooperation and win-win” relations with Washington as central in handling thorny issues. Unnerved by the US “rebalancing” push, Beijing pragmatically assumes that there is no credible proof that Washington has fundamentally altered its policy or is projecting a historic turnaround to fully confront China the “balancing” moves do not ring an alarmist bell to force China to overhaul its “peaceful rise” assurances. Growing assertiveness in Chinese responses to territorial disputes in the South China Sea and the East China Sea has little to do with Beijing’s calculus toward “rebalancing,” and, instead, has more to do with domestic political imperatives Many Chinese thought that the Philippine resort to a warship to check Chinese fishing boats in April 2012 gave Beijing legal authorization to respond with naval force.

"The proposed relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan as the security alliance approaches its 50th anniversary. This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents.  These problems are compounded by the continued financial burden placed on the Japanese people through Host Nation Support, and the denial of complete territorial sovereignty that the base represents.  According to the 2006 force realignment agreement between Washington and Tokyo, reaffirmed in May 2010, the active component of MCAS Futenma, Marine Air Group 36 will be relocated to another facility to be built in Henoko, attached to Camp Schwab.  Following the completion of the facility at Henoko, control of MCAS Futenma would be returned to Japan.  Additionally, 8,000 marines from the III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa will be moved to Guam, along with approximately 9,000 dependents.  The units being withdrawn to Guam comprise much of the command element of the III MEF and will include the following: III MEF Command Element, 3rd Marine Division Headquarters, 3rd Marine Logistics Group Headquarters, 1st Marine Air Wing Headquarters, and the 12th Marine Regiment Headquarters.  Finally, the Japanese government will contribute $6.09 billion of the estimated $10.27 billion cost of the relocation of troops to Guam as well as the relocation of Marine Aircraft Group 36.   The units stationed at Futenma constitute Marine Air Group 36, the aerial component of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, which is stationed throughout Okinawa.  Marine Air Group 36 is tasked with, “Provid[ing] all weather, day and night assault support aircraft capable of operating from amphibious ships, austere expeditionary airfields and forward operating bases ashore, as an integral part of the Aviation Combat Element of a Marine Air/Ground Task Force.”  To accomplish these objectives Marine Air Group 36 operates two squadrons of CH-46E Sea Knight medium transport helicopters, one squadron of KC-130J aerial refueling and transport aircraft, all supported by a marine aviation logistics squadron.  The United States has argued that the Marine Corps facility at Futenma is necessary for several missions – to counter a rising China, to deal with a contingency on the Korean peninsula, to protect sea lanes in the region, and to help mount humanitarian missions.  The narrow question is whether the relatively small force of Marines is critically necessary for these missions. The larger issue is how the United States and Japan view these missions and their respective roles in carrying them out.  China   China has made huge strides in increasing its military power, which worries Japan.  China has invested heavily in developing its own blue water navy as well as weapons systems such as its anti-carrier missile, the Dong Feng 21D, that challenge the alliance’s regional military supremacy.  The lack of transparency that has accompanied China’s military advancement has worried both U.S. and Japanese policymakers.  Japan has limited hard-power options to respond to potential Chinese aggression and relies heavily on American deterrence to forestall major conflict.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force stationed on Okinawa makes up a core pillar of the American strategy of deterrence.  Similar to the “Berlin tripwire” during the Cold War, the III Marine Expeditionary Force constitutes a credible U.S. commitment to Japanese security.   The possibility of China aggressively absorbing Taiwan is of chief concern to Japanese national security. Taiwan, after all, is close to important shipping lanes vital to Japanese trade.  All the cargo entering and exiting southern Japan traverses these lanes.  The repossession of Taiwan would put China in a position to blockade southern Japan.  Such a hostile repossession would also seriously damage U.S. commitment to extended deterrence since it would demonstrate that the United States didn’t want to or couldn’t defend Taiwan.  Japanese security, and to a large extent, regional stability is built on the foundation of this notion of extended deterrence.  The United States also has an interest in an autonomous Taiwan as a balance against China in order to maintain the regional status quo.  The relationship between Taiwan and the United States has been a major source of tension between the United States and China, which has been exacerbated by U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.   Territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas also complicate relations among China, Japan, and the United States.  Both the Chinese and Japanese governments dispute the demarcation of international boundaries in the East China Sea, with each claiming the other is infringing on its territorial sovereignty. The United States, meanwhile, considers the South China Sea to be international waters, while the Chinese consider it an area subject to their national sovereignty.  The most important role of U.S. forces stationed in Okinawa is to deter Chinese aggression toward Taiwan as well as in the East and South China Seas.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force is the most immediate U.S. force, which could respond to a crisis as a result of conflict over Taiwan.  It is also ideally positioned to help resolve potential flash points between China and Japan resulting from sovereignty issues over disputed territories such as the Senkaku Islands, near Okinawa.  Should conflict arise over Taiwan, the III Marine Expeditionary Force would likely play an ancillary role given that the United States would likely dispatch a carrier strike group to the area.  Although the III Marine Expeditionary Force could quickly react to the situation, its ability to influence events may be limited due to its size.  The United States and Japan also consider the protection of major sea lines of communication, particularly the Strait of Malacca and the Bashi Channel, to be vital to alliance security.  A tremendous amount of trade flows through this region, feeding the economies of Japan and the United States.  Disruption of this flow would be potentially devastating.  U.S. Marines stationed on Okinawa are ideally placed to respond to crises involving the sea lines of communication.  However, both countries have other forces suited to address this issue. The Japanese coast guard, the Maritime Self Defense Force, the U.S. Navy, and the coast guards of neighboring states police this area and protect vessels from piracy.  In the case of state encroachment, the United States would likely rely on vessels from the U.S. 7th fleet, which patrol the region and would be ideally placed and capable of responding.  In the event of a traditional confrontation over the sea lines of communication, however, the United States would likely rely on naval its forces, in combination with the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  North Korea and Humanitarian Missions  In his announcement that Japan would follow through with the 2006 agreement, former Prime Minister Hatoyama invoked the threat of North Korea as an explanation for his decision to acquiesce to U.S. pressure.  This argument was a weak attempt to deflect responsibility for his administration’s messy handling of the issue. After all, the notion that the III Marine Expeditionary Force contributes greatly to protection against North Korean aggression is questionable.  The United States currently maintains close to 28,000 troops in South Korea, a force capable of both deterring and responding to North Korean aggression.  Furthermore, elements of the 7th fleet, including the George Washington Carrier Strike Force, the Marine Air Station at Iwakuni, and the 5th Air Force make up a more than sufficient force to deter and counter North Korean aggression.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force would undoubtedly contribute in the event of conflict with North Korea, and U.S. military officials argue that units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force would be active in securing North Korean nuclear sites. However the III Marine Expeditionary Force would not be an essential part of any force deterring or confronting North Korea.  U.S. forces on Okinawa have acted as a first-responder to humanitarian crises, providing initial security and logistical support.  Units from Air Station Futenma have responded to several recent humanitarian crises including the 2004 tsunami, the 1995 Kobe earthquake, and the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines.  The rapid response ability afforded by units based at Futenma make the III Marine Expeditionary Force particularly adept at engaging in humanitarian missions.   However, units from the III Marine Expeditionary Force are not necessarily essential to humanitarian operations. The 7th fleet has typically been responsible for channeling aid to the disaster sites in the region.  The Japanese Coast Guard and the Maritime Self Defense Force have also been heavily involved in humanitarian missions.  Furthermore, the Japanese see involvement in humanitarian missions as a particularly important reason to further military development as well a way to legitimize military action and gain stronger standing within the international community.  Increased Japanese engagement in humanitarian missions would allow for the United States to take a back seat in this capacity and would lower its costs.  The Future of Futenma  The United States has offered four main reasons for maintaining the Marines at Futenma: defending Taiwan, protecting sea lanes, dealing with North Korea, and helping out during humanitarian crises. Of the four, the utility of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in the North Korea contingency is unconvincing due to the prevalence of other forces more able to deter or counter any act of aggression. The contingencies regarding the safety of the sea lines of communication and humanitarian operations would both involve elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force, but it is by no means pivotal to success.  The III Marine Expeditionary Force does contribute to deterring Chinese expansion and aggression in the East China Sea and toward Taiwan.  This appears to be the most powerful argument for the continued operation of the III Marine Expeditionary Force out of Okinawa.  The positioning of the III Marine Expeditionary Force in Okinawa, which reinforces U.S. commitment to Japanese security, is a costly signal to regional challengers of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence.  Moreover, the perception that extended U.S. deterrence is credible is of vital importance to the Japanese military.  According to Vice Admiral Kaneda (MSDF Ret.) “Once the U.S. defense is no longer perceived as credible, we will be in a global multi-polar military age which will make the region much less predictable.”  However, here too, other forces in the region contribute to providing extended deterrence, including the U.S. 7th fleet and the 5th Air Force.  Furthermore, an increase in the economic ties among all the major actors – the United States, Japan, China, and Taiwan – help to lower tensions and make conflict much more unlikely.  In the end, the tangible contributions of the III Marine Expeditionary Force to the strategy of deterring China, and to a lesser extent, North Korea, are debatable, and to many, not worth the cost.  However, there are no real metrics by which to measure the effectiveness of a strategy of deterrence other than that conflict has or has not broken out.  But both the United States and Japan are loath to simply abandon a strategy that has contributed to regional stability.  By relocating Marine Air Group 36 from Air Station Futenma to a planned base in Henoko, the United States will preserve a key element of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The 2006 realignment agreement will move command elements of the III Marine Expeditionary Force from Okinawa to Guam, while maintaining the overall operational capacities of the force – the U.S. military’s preferred solution.  Politically, however, this compromise is much more volatile and perhaps untenable in the long term. Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan and to the level of U.S. military forces stationed on the island.  Forcing the people of Okinawa to accept this resolution, contrary to their wishes, will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the United States and Japan.  The relocation plan is also now facing opposition from members of the U.S. Congress, who are attempting to rein in military spending in an effort to reduce the national deficit.  Indeed, the future of the relocation plan from Futenma to Henoko, although officially settled, remains up in the air.  In the meantime, the status quo holds. The United States does not feel that Japan is adequately capable of filling the operational void that would be left were it to withdraw key forces from Okinawa.  As a result, Washington has pressured Tokyo into accepting the 2006 realignment agreement as a transitional phase while the United States reduces its capabilities and Japan enhances its own. In Japan, meanwhile, the strongest voices in Japanese politics call for a continued U.S. military presence in order to ensure Japanese security, at least until Japan is able to more fully take on responsibility for its own security.  Furthermore, Japanese concerns over the rise of China as well their unpredictable nuclear-armed neighbor, North Korea, have strengthened the domestic case for remaining close to the United States while pursuing indigenous defense capabilities within the context of the security alliance.  For the short term, the United States should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Air Station Futenma.  This could mean placing limits on the number and intensity of training exercises conducted out of Futenma as well as holding more open dialogue with members of the local community in order to answer their concerns.   For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to discern whether Japan could take over some of the responsibilities of the III Marine Expeditionary Force.  The United States would be able to remove some of the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through other U.S. military installations in Japan, as well as throught the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella. By restoring sovereignty to the Japanese, the United States can make a significant gesture of its good intentions.  Restoring Japanese sovereignty will also allow the people of Okinawa better avenues to voice their concerns, which they currently lack, as well as engage in the democratic process.  Stronger Japan?   Many have advocated that the United States should continue to encourage the Japanese government to take a more active role in its own security in the context of a strong security alliance.  A stronger Japan in this context would allow the United States to divert resources from the region and direct them to areas where they are more greatly needed.  A stronger Japan would also be more able to engage with the international community and pursue a more equal relationship with the world’s great powers.  However, such a strategy faces several likely challenges. China and Korea would most likely see a strong Japan as threatening, possibly precipitating a regional arms race, escalating tensions, and creating a classic security dilemma.  Additionally, strong societal taboos against the use of military force in Japan still remain.  The continued resurgence of the Japanese military would almost assuredly require revision of Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, which remains very popular among the Japanese.  Finally, the Japanese economy has suffered a period of stagnation over the last decade as well as a sharp blow from the 2008 global recession.  Social programs for an aging population will place greater strain on the budget. It is therefore difficult to see where the money for expanding the military to the levels the United States desires will come from.  This divergence - between U.S. expectations and the realities of Japanese capabilities, both in the present and the future – has come to the fore during the debate over Futenma and will continue to plague the alliance.  Since Hatoyama’s resignation, both Tokyo and Washington have attempted to patch up their differences in an effort to present a united front to the region and the world.  In a move widely praised by the Obama administration, Prime Minister Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan.  With that decision, the matter seemed closed.  However, as is often the case, rhetoric does not mirror reality.  There continues to be significant Okinawan opposition to the planned relocation, which has manifested itself in recent elections.  The citizens of Nago City, which controls the district where the replacement facility is to be located, made their intentions clear by electing a majority (16 of 27 seats) of candidates who oppose the relocation plan to their city assembly.   The controversy will also likely play a large role in the November election for governor of Okinawa.  The incumbent, Hirokazu Nakaima, faces former Ginowan City mayor, Yoichi Iha.  Iha has come out in strong opposition to the relocation plan as well as to the continued operation of the Futenma base at all.  Nakaima, bending to popular opposition to relocation, has at times harshly criticized Tokyo over its actions on the matter, but he has not declared categorical opposition to the base.  With Naoto Kan retaining leadership of the DPJ and thereby the prime ministership, the stage has been set for a major domestic political show-down between Tokyo and the local Okinawan governments, and the crisis over Futenma will likely recur in the coming months.  Meanwhile, on this side of the Pacific, concerns over the national debt level have caused U.S. lawmakers to advocate slashing the defense department’s budget.  Chief among those expenditures under the congressional microscope is the U.S. network of overseas bases.  The efficacy of these bases, at one time a given, is now being questioned. Furthermore, there is some evidence that the United States has downgraded the importance of the security alliance with Japan in favor of other allies in East Asia.  During the G-20 summit in Toronto last June, President Obama referred to South Korea as “the lynchpin” of U.S. East Asian strategy.  This statement was followed more recently by Secretary Clinton’s listing South Korea before Japan when discussing vital regional allies.  Shortly after her speech, the Yomiuri Shimbun ran the headline “Japan is Lower Than South Korea in the Ranking of U.S. Allies in Asia,” testifying to the level of Japanese angst over the alliance.  Unfortunately, we are left with a real difficulty in charting the way forward.  There are certainly those who consider the Futenma controversy a small bump in the road on the way to the reaffirmation of the alliance, an alliance that will become more equal as Japan, with U.S. encouragement and guidance, accepts more responsibility and regains its status as a normal international power.  However, there are others who are much more pessimistic about the future and see Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis that will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed.  In either case, the way forward will be painful for both sides as it will require a realistic appraisal of interests, goals, and most importantly, capabilities in a new era of economic austerity and public skepticism.",summarize the following text: ,"The proposed relocation of Futenma within Okinawa has been met by fierce local opposition and has led to a period of extended tension between the United States and Japan This opposition stems from the problems of pollution, crime, environmental degradation, and safety that the base presents  relocating Futenma to Henoko is more volatile and untenable in the long term Okinawa is home to a large and vocal opposition to the relocation plan Forcing Okinawa to accept this resolution will be a source of domestic discontent as well as of continuing tensions between the U S and Japan For the short term, the U S should make every attempt at limiting the local impact of Futenma For the long term the U.S. and Japan must re-examine the realignment agreement to remove the more controversial elements of its forces in Okinawa while maintaining its commitment to extended deterrence through the 7th Fleet, the 5th Air Force, and the U.S. nuclear umbrella the U S can make a significant gesture of its good intentions Kan reaffirmed the Japanese government’s commitment to the relocation plan With that decision, the matter seemed closed However rhetoric does not mirror reality There continues to be significant  opposition to the planned relocation the stage has been set for a major show-down and the crisis over Futenma as a festering and recurring crisis will precipitate the unraveling of the U.S.-Japanese relationship unless appropriately addressed"
"In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force was now economically futile as international finance and trade had become so interconnected that harming the enemy’s property would equate to harming your own.[1] A year later Europe’s economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the First World War. Almost a century later Steven Pinker made a similar claim. Pinker argues, “Though the relationship between America and China is far from warm, we are unlikely to declare war on them or vice versa. Morality aside, they make too much of our stuff and we owe them too much money.”[2] His argument rests upon the liberal assumption that high levels of trade and investment between two states, in this case the US and China, will make war unlikely, if not impossible. It is this assumption that this essay seeks to evaluate.
This essay is divided into three sections. The first briefly outlines the theory that economic interdependence results in a reduced likelihood of conflict, breaking the theory down into smaller components that can be examined. In the second section, this essay suggests that the premise ‘more trade equals less conflict’ is simplistic. It does not take into account many of the variables that can influence the strength of economic interdependence’s conflict reducing attributes. Within this section, the essay considers: the extent to which conflict cuts off trade, theories arguing that how and what a state trades matters, Copeland’s theory of trade expectations and the differences between status quo and revisionist states. The final section deals with the realist perspective, concentrating on arguments pertaining to the primacy of strategic interests and arguments that economic interdependence will increase the likelihood of conflict owing to a reduction of deterrence credibility. Each section will be related back to the US-China relationship with a view to assessing Pinker’s claim. The essay will conclude that economic interdependence does reduce the likelihood of conflict but is insufficient on its own to completely prevent it. To calculate the likelihood of conflict correctly one would need to factor in the nature of the economic interdependence alongside the strength of the strategic interests at stake.
Economic Interdependence and Conflict
The theory that increased economic interdependence reduces conflict rests on three observations: trade benefits states in a manner that decision-makers value; conflict will reduce or completely cut-off trade; and that decision-makers will take the previous two observations into account before choosing to go to war. Based on these observations, one should expect that the higher the benefit of trade, the higher the cost of a potential conflict. After a certain point, the value of trade may become so high that the state in question has become economically dependent on another. Proponents of this theory argue that if two states have reached this point of mutual dependence (interdependence), their decision-makers will value the continuation of trade relations higher than any potential gains to be made through war.[3] It is on this argument that Pinker rests his statement that the economic relationship between the US and China precludes war. One can see evidence of this when analysing US views on China as trade rises. A 2014 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey indicates that only a minority of Americans see China as a critical threat, compared to a majority in the mid-1990s. This number is even higher when analysing Americans who directly benefit from trade with China.[4]
As compelling as this argument may be, high levels of economic interdependence have not always resulted in peace. The decades preceding WW1 saw an unprecedented growth in international trade, communication, and interconnectivity but needless to say, war broke out.[5] This instance alone is not enough to disprove Pinker’s logic. War may become very unlikely but began nonetheless.[6] Let us take two hypothetical scenarios, one in which the chances of war is 80% and the other in which trade has reduced the likelihood of war to 10%. Just knowing that war did indeed take place does not tell us which scenario was in play. Similarly, the fact that WW1 took place gives us no information about whether economic interdependence made war unlikely or not. In fact, evidence even exists to suggest that economic linkages prevented a war from breaking out during the sequence of crises that led up to WW1.[7] However, the fact that a war as detrimental as WW1 could break out despite a supposed reduction of the likelihood of conflict gives us an impetus to examine whether this reduction does take place. Additionally, if this is the case, what variables can weaken this pacifying effect?
Does Conflict Cut off Trade?
Economic interdependence theory makes the assumption that conflict will reduce or cut-off trade. This assumption appears to be logical, as one would expect that the moment two states are officially adversaries, fear of relative gains would ensure that policy makers want to completely cut-off trade. However, there are many historical examples of trade between warring states carrying on during wartime, including strategic goods that directly affect the ability of the enemy to carry out the war.[8] For example, in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, British insurance companies continued to insure enemy ships and paid to replace ships that were being destroyed by their own army.[9] Even during WW2, there are numerous examples of American firms continuing to trade strategic goods with Nazi Germany.[10] Barbieri and Levy argue that these examples and their own statistical analysis suggest that the outbreak of war does not radically reduce trade between enemies, and when it does, it often quickly returns to pre-war levels after the war has concluded.[11]
In response to this result, Anderton and Carter conducted an interrupted time-series study on the effect war has on trade in which they analysed 14 major power wars and 13 non-major power wars. Seven of the non-major power wars negatively impacted trade (although only four of these reductions were significant), but in the major war category, all results bar one showed a reduction of trade during wartime and a quick return to pre-war levels at its conclusion.[12] Accompanying this contradictory finding one must take into account that even if war does not radically reduce trade, if a state believes that it does then potential opportunity cost would still figure in their calculations.
Variables that Impact the Pacifying Effect of Economic Interdependence
The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is not constant. It achieves this via a discussion of the effect of changes in a number of variables pertaining to how and what a state trades. Once it is established that changes in such variables may alter the effect of economic interdependence on the likelihood of conflict, Pinker’s statement (that the level of trade between the US and China makes conflict unlikely) can be considered to be an over-simplification.
One variable is the relative levels of economic dependence. Some argue that asymmetry of trade can increase the chances of conflict if the trade is more important to one state than it is to the other; their resolve would not be reduced by the same degree. The less dependent state would be far more willing than its adversary to initiate a conflict.[13] An example is the possibility of the prevalent idea in China that ‘Japan needs China more than China needs Japan’ leading to China becoming more assertive in Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute.[14] It is important to recognize that all trade is asymmetric in one fashion or another. It is radical asymmetry that one has to fear, which at the moment does not appear to be the case in the China-Japan or US-China case.
Another variable is the specifics of what is being traded. A study by Dorussen suggests that the pacifying effect of trade is less evident if the trade consists of raw materials and agriculture but stronger if the trade consists of manufactured goods. Even within the category of manufactured goods there are differences in effect. Mass consumer goods yield the strongest pacifying results whilst high-technology sectors such as electronics and highly capital-intensive sectors such as transport and metal industries tend to have a relatively weak effect.[15] If it is a sector with alternative trade avenues then embargos and boycotts as a result of conflict will have far less effect.[16] The rule is that the more inelastic the import demand, the higher the opportunity cost and the smaller the probability of conflict.[17] According to these studies, trade still generally reduces the likelihood of conflict however it is by no means homogeneous in its effects. Additionally, the opportunity costs are not the same for importers and exporters. Dorussen’s study suggests that increased trade in oil tends to make the exporters more hostile and the importers friendlier in relations to their foreign policy.[18] Taking this framework into account, in 2014 China’s top five exports to the US (computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones and office machine parts) all fell under the category of electronics,[19] whilst the US’s top five exports to China (air and/or spacecraft, soybeans, cars, integrated circuits and scrap copper) were all either high-capital intensive sectors or raw materials and agriculture.[20] According to Dorussen’s study, these exports should not yield the strongest possible conflict reducing results, which could impact the validity of Pinker’s statement.
Copeland presents another variable, namely expectations of trade. Copeland argues that if a highly dependent state expects future trade to be high, decision makers will behave as many liberals predict and treat war as a less appealing option. However if there are low expectations of future trade, then a highly dependent state will attach a low or even negative value to continued peace
ful relations and war would become more likely.[21] As an example, he points out that despite high levels of trade in 1914 German leaders believed that rival great powers would attempt to undermine this trade in the future, so a war to secure control over raw materials was in the interests of German long-term security.[22] Via this framework, if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less dependent on China’s economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the probability of conflict.
The final variable this essay will discuss relates to the differences between status quo and revisionist states. Most empirical analyses of economic interdependence tend to group together states as different as the United States, Pakistan, Australia, Germany and China and assume that variations in their behaviour would be the same.[23] Papayoanou on the other hand, argues that when analysing the effects of economic interdependence it is useful to differentiate the effects on great power states and states with revisionist aspirations.[24] If a status quo power has strong economic ties with revisionist state there will be interest groups who advocate engagement and who believe that confrontational stances will threaten the political foundation of economic links. This will constrain the response of the status quo state.[25] One can see evidence of such an interest group in the US, a group Friedberg describes as the Shanghai coalition, who he argues advocate engagement with China at the expense of balancing.[26] A study by Fordham and Kleinberg backs up this argument as they find that US business elites who benefit from trade with China tend to see little benefit in limiting the growth of Chinese power.[27] A 21st Century revisionist power is far less likely to be a democracy, and therefore, interest groups will influence the leadership far less. This means an authoritarian revisionist power will be working under fewer constraints and will be able to take a more aggressive stance.[28] This appears to be the case in China where rather than having domestic constraints on taking an aggressive stance against Japan, one of their biggest trading partners, grassroots nationalism has made explicit cooperation a domestically risky option.[29]
There are many indicators to suggest that China is a revisionist power willing to wage war. Lemke and Werner argue that an extraordinary growth of military expenditures’ reveals when a state is dissatisfied with the status quo.[30] Data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute certainly indicates that China qualifies as its military expenditure has nominally increased by 1270% between 1995 and 2015.[31] Additionally, the military modernization appears to be aimed at capabilities to contest US primacy in East Asia.[32] Much like German strategists recognized that Britain was operating under significant domestic constraints, China could realize the same of the US.[33] This is not to say that Chinese decision-makers would be cavalier about making a decision that would be to the detriment its economy. A crash in the Chinese economy due to the loss of exports to the US could potentially undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and endanger the regime. However, the view that China is a revisionist power indicates that good trade relations alone will not result in a low probability of conflict.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to Dominance of Strategic Interests
Having established that if the pacifying effect of trade does exist, it can rise or fall depending on changes in a series of variables this essay proceeds to deal with realist theories arguing that trade has a negligible or even negative effect on the likelihood of conflict. Buzan argues that noneconomic factors contribute far more to major phenomena than liberal theorists usually cite to support their theory.[34] There is evidence of the primacy of strategic interests in Masterson’s 2012 study on the relationship between China’s economic interdependence and political relations with its neighbours. The study concluded that as economic interdependence with neighbouring states increased the likelihood of conflict did indeed decrease, but that the impact was minimal when compared to the impact of relative power capabilities. In other words, political and military issues dominated interstate relations. Growth in power disparities were associated with decreases in dyadic political relations that were greater than the increase caused by economic interdependence.[35]
If the pacifying effect of trade can rise and fall so can the provocative effect of strategic interests. It is important to distinguish between the existence of a strategic interest and a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability. China and the US have many opposing strategic interests, but neither is in a strategically vulnerable position. For example, China shares many borders, but none present the same threat of invasion that Tsarist Russia did to Imperial Germany as none of the current maritime tensions between China, Japan, and the US equate to a matter of national survival.[36] This is crucial as some believe that for a crisis to escalate to a major war an actor who is isolated and believes that history is conspiring against them is needed. Only this actor would take an existential risk to try and offset their strategic vulnerability.[37] Imperial Germany fit this description, but neither China nor the US does. This is largely due to the geography of the region. The tension between the US, China and Japan are over maritime regions. Maritime issues still relate to national interests but, as Krause points out, “Land armies are still the only forces that can conquer and hold territory.”[38] Taking this into account one can argue that the benefits of US-China trade are, for each state, currently greater than the benefits of pursing strategic benefits via force, but this situation will only remain as long as the situation does not become one of unbearable strategic vulnerability.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to the Undermining of Deterrence
Having established that scenarios exist where strategic interests and vulnerabilities have a greater effect on the likelihood of war than economic interdependence, this essay will now evaluate arguments that economic interdependence can increase the likelihood of conflict through the undermining of deterrence. The argument proceeds as follows: if economic interdependence constrains the ability or willingness of a state to use its military, security is lowered as the state now has a weakened ability to engage in deterrence and defensive alliances. Deterrence relies on the ability of a state to make credible threats and defensive alliances rely on credible promises to protect one’s allies.[39] Credibility is defined as the product of the operational capability to follow through with a threat and the communication of resolve to use force.[40] What is at risk here is that if economic interconnectivity interferes with the communication of resolve to use force then states may end up with a way that neither side expected or wanted.
Some argue that it was such a failure to communicate resolve that resulted in the beginning of WW1. Indeed, Jolly claims that: “The Austrians had believed that vigorous actions against Serbia and a promise of German support would deter Russia: the Russians had believed that a show of strength against Austria would both check the Austrians and deter Germany. In both cases, the bluff had been called and the three countries were faced with the military consequences of their actions.”[41] The risk in the US-China case would be that the interest groups described earlier would prevent the US from effectively communicating its resolve to use force if China were to cross a redline. The flaw in this argument lies in the fact that whilst interest groups might push back against public statements outlining redlines; the US has many less overt options available to it to communicate resolve. Modern technology and the forms of interconnectivity have resulted in many more lines of communication between China and the US than adversaries had access to in 1914. Private meetings, electronic communication and numerous other methods of communication have the capability to be candid without being visible to interest groups. It is for this reason that this essay discounts the theory that Sino-American economic interdependence results in a reduction of deterrence and therefore increases the likelihood of conflict.
Conclusion
This essay has shown that the strength of the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is subject to change depending on a series of dynamic variables. It has also demonstrated that the strength of the conflict provoking effects of strategic interests can change depending on whether the strategic interest amounts to a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability. It has discounted the theory that interdependence leads to a higher chance of conflict through an erosion of credibility. To sum up, trade does seem to reduce the likelihood of conflict but should not be seen as a deterministic factor as strategic interests, and vulnerabilities also have a large effect. There is no hard rule as to what will be the driving factor as the nature of economic interdependence and of strategic factors impact their relative values.
Accordingly, Pinker’s statement that the trade between the US and China makes war exceptionally unlikely is simplistic and misleading because it fails to account for a wide array of variables that can radically change the likelihood of a Sino-American war. An intellectually honest thesis would insist upon a comprehensive approach in which the level of economic activity is simply one of many variables that is required.",summarize the following text: ,"In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force was economically futile as trade had become so interconnected A year later World War the liberal assumption that high levels of trade make war unlikely

Does Conflict Cut off Trade?
Economic interdependence theory makes the assumption that conflict will reduce or cut-off trade. This assumption appears to be logical, as one would expect that the moment two states are officially adversaries, fear of relative gains would ensure that policy makers want to completely cut-off trade. However, there are many historical examples of trade between warring states carrying on during wartime, including strategic goods that directly affect the ability of the enemy to carry out the war.[8] For example, in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, British insurance companies continued to insure enemy ships and paid to replace ships that were being destroyed by their own army.[9] Even during WW2, there are numerous examples of American firms continuing to trade strategic goods with Nazi Germany.[10] Barbieri and Levy argue that these examples and their own statistical analysis suggest that the outbreak of war does not radically reduce trade between enemies, and when it does, it often quickly returns to pre-war levels after the war has concluded.[11]
In response to this result, Anderton and Carter conducted an interrupted time-series study on the effect war has on trade in which they analysed 14 major power wars and 13 non-major power wars. Seven of the non-major power wars negatively impacted trade (although only four of these reductions were significant), but in the major war category, all results bar one showed a reduction of trade during wartime and a quick return to pre-war levels at its conclusion.[12] Accompanying this contradictory finding one must take into account that even if war does not radically reduce trade, if a state believes that it does then potential opportunity cost would still figure in their calculations.
Variables that Impact the Pacifying Effect of Economic Interdependence
The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is not constant. It achieves this via a discussion of the effect of changes in a number of variables pertaining to how and what a state trades. Once it is established that changes in such variables may alter the effect of economic interdependence on the likelihood of conflict, Pinker’s statement (that the level of trade between the US and China makes conflict unlikely) can be considered to be an over-simplification.
One variable is the relative levels of economic dependence. Some argue that asymmetry of trade can increase the chances of conflict if the trade is more important to one state than it is to the other; their resolve would not be reduced by the same degree. The less dependent state would be far more willing than its adversary to initiate a conflict.[13] An example is the possibility of the prevalent idea in China that ‘Japan needs China more than China needs Japan’ leading to China becoming more assertive in Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute.[14] It is important to recognize that all trade is asymmetric in one fashion or another. It is radical asymmetry that one has to fear, which at the moment does not appear to be the case in the China-Japan or US-China case.

A study by Dorussen suggests that the pacifying effect of trade is less evident if the trade consists of raw materials and agriculture but stronger if the trade consists of manufactured goods. Even within the category of manufactured goods there are differences in effect.

Copeland presents another variable, namely expectations of trade. Copeland argues that if a highly dependent state expects future trade to be high, decision makers will behave as many liberals predict and treat war as a less appealing option. However if there are low expectations of future trade, then a highly dependent state will attach a low or even negative value to continued peaceful relations and war would become more likely.[21] As an example, he points out that despite high levels of trade in 1914 German leaders believed that rival great powers would attempt to undermine this trade in the future, so a war to secure control over raw materials was in the interests of German long-term security.[22] Via this framework, if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less dependent on China’s economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the probability of conflict.
The final variable this essay will discuss relates to the differences between status quo and revisionist states. Most empirical analyses of economic interdependence tend to group together states as different as the United States, Pakistan, Australia, Germany and China and assume that variations in their behaviour would be the same.[23] Papayoanou on the other hand, argues that when analysing the effects of economic interdependence it is useful to differentiate the effects on great power states and states with revisionist aspirations.[24] If a status quo power has strong economic ties with revisionist state there will be interest groups who advocate engagement and who believe that confrontational stances will threaten the political foundation of economic links. This will constrain the response of the status quo state.[25] One can see evidence of such an interest group in the US, a group Friedberg describes as the Shanghai coalition, who he argues advocate engagement with China at the expense of balancing.[26] A study by Fordham and Kleinberg backs up this argument as they find that US business elites who benefit from trade with China tend to see little benefit in limiting the growth of Chinese power.[27] A 21st Century revisionist power is far less likely to be a democracy, and therefore, interest groups will influence the leadership far less. This means an authoritarian revisionist power will be working under fewer constraints and will be able to take a more aggressive stance.[28] This appears to be the case in China where rather than having domestic constraints on taking an aggressive stance against Japan, one of their biggest trading partners, grassroots nationalism has made explicit cooperation a domestically risky option.[29]
There are many indicators to suggest that China is a revisionist power willing to wage war. Lemke and Werner argue that an extraordinary growth of military expenditures’ reveals when a state is dissatisfied with the status quo.[30] Data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute certainly indicates that China qualifies as its military expenditure has nominally increased by 1270% between 1995 and 2015.[31] Additionally, the military modernization appears to be aimed at capabilities to contest US primacy in East Asia.[32] Much like German strategists recognized that Britain was operating under significant domestic constraints, China could realize the same of the US.[33] This is not to say that Chinese decision-makers would be cavalier about making a decision that would be to the detriment its economy. A crash in the Chinese economy due to the loss of exports to the US could potentially undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and endanger the regime. However, the view that China is a revisionist power indicates that good trade relations alone will not result in a low probability of conflict.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to Dominance of Strategic Interests
Having established that if the pacifying effect of trade does exist, it can rise or fall depending on changes in a series of variables this essay proceeds to deal with realist theories arguing that trade has a negligible or even negative effect on the likelihood of conflict. Buzan argues that noneconomic factors contribute far more to major phenomena than liberal theorists usually cite to support their theory.[34] There is evidence of the primacy of strategic interests in Masterson’s 2012 study on the relationship between China’s economic interdependence and political relations with its neighbours. The study concluded that as economic interdependence with neighbouring states increased the likelihood of conflict did indeed decrease, but that the impact was minimal when compared to the impact of relative power capabilities. In other words, political and military issues dominated interstate relations. Growth in power disparities were associated with decreases in dyadic political relations that were greater than the increase caused by economic interdependence.[35]
If the pacifying effect of trade can rise and fall so can the provocative effect of strategic interests. It is important to distinguish between the existence of a strategic interest and a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability. China and the US have many opposing strategic interests, but neither is in a strategically vulnerable position. For example, China shares many borders, but none present the same threat of invasion that Tsarist Russia did to Imperial Germany as none of the current maritime tensions between China, Japan, and the US equate to a matter of national survival.[36] This is crucial as some believe that for a crisis to escalate to a major war an actor who is isolated and believes that history is conspiring against them is needed. Only this actor would take an existential risk to try and offset their strategic vulnerability.[37] Imperial Germany fit this description, but neither China nor the US does. This is largely due to the geography of the region. The tension between the US, China and Japan are over maritime regions. Maritime issues still relate to national interests but, as Krause points out, “Land armies are still the only forces that can conquer and hold territory.”[38] Taking this into account one can argue that the benefits of US-China trade are, for each state, currently greater than the benefits of pursing strategic benefits via force, but this situation will only remain as long as the situation does not become one of unbearable strategic vulnerability.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to the Undermining of Deterrence
Having established that scenarios exist where strategic interests and vulnerabilities have a greater effect on the likelihood of war than economic interdependence, this essay will now evaluate arguments that economic interdependence can increase the likelihood of conflict through the undermining of deterrence. The argument proceeds as follows: if economic interdependence constrains the ability or willingness of a state to use its military, security is lowered as the state now has a weakened ability to engage in deterrence and defensive alliances. Deterrence relies on the ability of a state to make credible threats and defensive alliances rely on credible promises to protect one’s allies.[39] Credibility is defined as the product of the operational capability to follow through with a threat and the communication of resolve to use force.[40] What is at risk here is that if economic interconnectivity interferes with the communication of resolve to use force then states may end up with a way that neither side expected or wanted.
Some argue that it was such a failure to communicate resolve that resulted in the beginning of WW1. Indeed, Jolly claims that: “The Austrians had believed that vigorous actions against Serbia and a promise of German support would deter Russia: the Russians had believed that a show of strength against Austria would both check the Austrians and deter Germany. In both cases, the bluff had been called and the three countries were faced with the military consequences of their actions.”[41] The risk in the US-China case would be that the interest groups described earlier would prevent the US from effectively communicating its resolve to use force if China were to cross a redline. The flaw in this argument lies in the fact that whilst interest groups might push back against public statements outlining redlines; the US has many less overt options available to it to communicate resolve. Modern technology and the forms of interconnectivity have resulted in many more lines of communication between China and the US than adversaries had access to in 1914. Private meetings, electronic communication and numerous other methods of communication have the capability to be candid without being visible to interest groups. It is for this reason that this essay discounts the theory that Sino-American economic interdependence results in a reduction of deterrence and therefore increases the likelihood of conflict.
Conclusion
This essay has shown that the strength of the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is subject to change depending on a series of dynamic variables. It has also demonstrated that the strength of the conflict provoking effects of strategic interests can change depending on whether the strategic interest amounts to a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability. It has discounted the theory that interdependence leads to a higher chance of conflict through an erosion of credibility. To sum up, trade does seem to reduce the likelihood of conflict but should not be seen as a deterministic factor as strategic interests, and vulnerabilities also have a large effect. There is no hard rule as to what will be the driving factor as the nature of economic interdependence and of strategic factors impact their relative values.
Accordingly, Pinker’s statement that the trade between the US and China makes war exceptionally unlikely is simplistic and misleading because it fails to account for a wide array of variables that can radically change the likelihood of a Sino-American war. An intellectually honest thesis would insist upon a comprehensive approach in which the level of economic activity is simply one of many variables that is required.",summarize the following text: ,"In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force was economically futile as trade had become so interconnected A year later World War the liberal assumption that high levels of trade make war unlikely
the premise ‘more trade equals less conflict’ is simplistic. It does not take into account many of the variables that can influence economic interdependence’s conflict reducing attributes economic interdependence is insufficient to prevent it
high levels of economic interdependence have not always resulted in peace decades preceding WW1 saw an unprecedented growth in trade
interdependence theory makes the assumption that conflict will reduce or cut-off trade However, there are many historical examples of trade between warring states carrying on including strategic goods that directly affect the ability of the enemy to carry out the war. in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, British insurance companies continued to insure enemy ships and paid to replace ships destroyed by their own army Even during WW2, there are numerous examples of American firms continuing to trade strategic goods with Germany
Variables that Impact the Pacifying Effect of Economic Interdependence
pacifying effect of economic interdependence is not constant statement that the level of trade makes conflict unlikely can be considered to be an over-simplification.
asymmetry of trade can increase the chances of conflict if the trade is more important to one state than it is to the other; their resolve would not be reduced by the same degree The less dependent state would be far more willing to initiate a conflict
Another variable is the specifics of what is being traded If it is a sector with alternative trade avenues then embargos and boycotts as a result of conflict will have far less effect the more inelastic the import demand, the higher the opportunity cost of conflict opportunity costs are not the same for importers and exporters increased trade in oil tends to make the exporters more hostile and the importers friendlier in relations to their foreign policy.[18] Taking this framework into account, in 2014 China’s top five exports to the US (computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones and office machine parts) all fell under the category of electronics,[19] whilst the US’s top five exports to China (air and/or spacecraft, soybeans, cars, integrated circuits and scrap copper) were all either high-capital intensive sectors or raw materials and agriculture.[20] According to Dorussen’s study, these exports should not yield the strongest possible conflict reducing results, which could impact the validity of Pinker’s statement.
another variable expectations of trade if there are low expectations of future trade a highly dependent state will attach a low or even negative value to continued peaceful relations if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less dependent on China’s economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the probability of conflict.
Most empirical analyses group together states and assume that variations in their behaviour would be the same Papayoanou argues that when analysing the effects of economic interdependence it is useful to differentiate the effects on great power states and states with revisionist aspirations an authoritarian revisionist power will be working under fewer constraints and will be able to take a more aggressive stance.
noneconomic factors contribute far more to major phenomena than liberal theorists usually cite to support their theory Masterson concluded that as economic interdependence increased likelihood of conflict did decrease but that the impact was minimal when compared to the impact of relative power capabilities political and military issues dominated interstate relations
scenarios exist where strategic interests and vulnerabilities have a greater effect on the likelihood of war than economic interdependence
trade should not be seen as a deterministic factor strategic interests, and vulnerabilities also have a large effect

Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict? Or might downturns encourage austerity and economizing behavior in foreign policy? This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals. For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition. Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy. This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international systemic changes), as well as many other possible confounding variables. This research questions existing theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace may result from economic troubles. I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely. Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely. In other words, rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically. This definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which “[b]oth actors view each other as a significant politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy.”2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage. Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this project’s empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry. Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels. (1) Economic crises lead to austerity pressures, which in turn incent leaders to search for ways to cut defense expenditures. (2) Economic crises also encourage strategic reassessment, so that leaders can argue to their peers and their publics that defense spending can be arrested without endangering the state. This can lead to threat deflation, where elites attempt to downplay the seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. (3) If a state faces multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to consider threat prioritization, a process that is postponed during periods of economic normalcy. (4) Economic crises increase the political and economic benefit from international economic cooperation. Leaders seek foreign aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad during periods of economic trouble. This search is made easier if tensions are reduced with historic rivals. (5) Finally, during crises, elites are more prone to select leaders who are perceived as capable of resolving economic difficulties, permitting the emergence of leaders who hold heterodox foreign policy views. Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy. This section reviews this causal logic in greater detail, while also providing historical examples that these mechanisms recur in practice. Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Economic crises generate pressure for austerity. Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish. Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable. When growth slowdowns are prolonged, the cumulative departure from planning targets can grow even further, even if no single quarter meets the technical definition of recession. Pressures for austerity are felt most acutely in governments that face difficulty borrowing to finance deficit expenditures. This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit. Even for states that can borrow, however, intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence—a belief in what is sometimes called “expansionary austerity”—generates incentives to curtail expenditure. These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target poverty alleviation, welfare programs, or economic subsidies. As a result, mass and elite constituents strongly resist such cuts. Welfare programs and other forms of public spending may be especially susceptible to a policy “ratchet effect,” where people are very reluctant to forego benefits once they have become accustomed to their availability.6 As Paul Pierson has argued, “The politics [of welfare state] retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters in return for diffuse and uncertain gains.”7 Austerity Leads to Cutbacks in Defense Spending At a minimum, the political costs of pursuing austerity through cutbacks in social and economic expenditures alone make such a path unappealing. In practice, this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil. There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget, and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public. Many militaries need foreign arms and foreign ammunition for their militaries, so defense expenditures are doubly costly since they both take up valuable defense budget space while also sending hard currency overseas, rather than constituencies at home. Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict even if that means policies of appeasement and conciliation.8 During periods of economic expansion, the opportunity costs associated with defense expenditure—the requirement for higher taxes or foregone spending in other areas—are real but acceptable. Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending. There is a constituency for defense spending in the armed services, intelligence agencies, and arms industries, but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones. Defense Cutbacks Encourage Rapprochement An interest in defense cutbacks can lead to conciliatory behavior through two paths. First, the cutbacks themselves serve as a concrete signal to adversaries that the military threat posed by the economically distressed state is declining. This permits the other state to halt that portion of defense spending dedicated to keeping up, breaking the back of ongoing arms races through reciprocated, but non-negotiated moves. Unilateral conventional force reductions were a major element of Gorbachev’s foreign policy in the late 1980s, alongside negotiated strategic arms control, and diplomatic efforts to achieve political understandings with the United States.9 Gorbachev similarly used force reductions in Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the Soviet Far East to signal to China in 1987 that he was serious about political negotiations.10 Elsewhere, non-negotiated, tit-for-tat military redeployments facilitated Argentina-Brazil rapprochement.11 Second, leaders may believe cutbacks are necessary, but would be dangerous in the absence of negotiated improvements with traditional foes. Economic downturns can serve as motivation to pursue arms control or political settlement. During periods of normalcy, such outcomes would be positives, but are viewed as “too hard” by political leaders that move from one urgent problem to the next. During periods of economic crisis, however, arms control or political improvements might allow for much needed cuts in defense spending, and are pursued with greater vigor. The Johnson administration attempted both unilateral and negotiated arms limitations because of budgetary concerns as President Johnson and Secretary McNamara struggled to pay for the “Great Society” domestic programs and the increasingly costly Vietnam War. They first attempted unilateral “caps” on costly nuclear forces and anti-ballistic missile defenses and when this failed to lead to a reciprocal Soviet response they engaged in formal arms control talks. Détente continued in the Nixon administration, accelerating in 1971 and 1972, simultaneous with rising budget deficits and inflation so serious that Nixon instituted price controls. Nixon’s decision to sharply limit anti-ballistic missile defenses to enable arms control talks was contrary to his strategic views, but necessitated by a difficult budgetary environment that made paying for more missile defense emplacements unrealistic.12 As Nixon told his national security advisor Kissinger in an April 1972 discussion of ballistic missile and anti-ballistic missile developments: “You know we've got a hell of a budget problem. We've got to cut it down, we've got to cut 5 billion dollars off next year's defense budget. So, I don't want to [inaudible: do it?] unless we've got some settlement with the Russians.”13 In practice, unilateral defense cuts and force reductions are frequently combined with negotiated political agreements in a sequential, iterative fashion, where a unilateral reduction will signal seriousness that opens the way for political agreement, which in turn permits even deeper reductions. Defense cuts and force reductions are not only a means to achieve rivalry termination, but also a goal in and of themselves that rivalry termination helps secure. Leaders are seeking resources from defense they can use elsewhere. Thus when Argentine leader Raul Alfonsín campaigned for the need for drastic budgetary austerity, his specific “platform was the reduction of military spending to use it for the other ministries, connected with the concept of eliminating the hypothesis of conflict” with Argentinian rivals, according to Adalberto Rodríguez Giavarini, who served in Alfonsín’s ministry of defense (and later was Argentina’s foreign minister).14 Similarly, Gorbachev was motivated to reduce arms in the late 1980s because he determined it was necessary to cut Soviet defense spending and defense production, and repurpose part of the defense industry to make consumer and civilian capital goods, according to contemporary U.S. Central Intelligence Agency classified assessments.15 Thus the “main reason” why strategic arms control breakthroughs occurred from 1986 to 1988 and the Soviet Afghan intervention concluded in 1989 was a realization within the Politburo of “excessively high expenditures on defense,” according to Nikolai Ryzhkov, Gorbachev’s prime minister.16 Economic Downturns Provoke Strategic Reassessment: Threat Deflation and Prioritization Economic downturns encourage leaders to seek new ideas to use to frame their policy problems. During periods of economic difficulty, elites can come to realize that their problems are not amenable to old solutions, and search for new ideas.17 During an economic crisis, politics and policy are “more fluid,” as old answers seem stale and insufficient.18 An ideational entrepreneur that can link economic lemons to foreign policy lemonade can find a patron when leaders are casting about for ways to reframe the world in acceptable ways to their peers and publics. The behavior of an old foe is often ambiguous, and can be viewed as either injurious to one’s interests or neutral toward them. During periods of normalcy, the motivation of defense establishments is tilted toward threat and danger. During periods of economic crisis, national leaders have a counteracting motivation to downplay such dangers, so that the threats faced by a nation are manageable through available resources. Economic difficulties provide a motivation for leaders to view equivocal signals from the international system in a way that is benign. To the extent that rivalries are perpetuated because of threat inflation, economic downturns provide incentives to deflate the threat, potentially disrupting cycles of competition and enmity. South Korean president Kim Dae-jong came to power in the aftermath of the 1998 Asian economic crisis, pursued a “sunshine policy” toward the North, cut South Korean defense spending in nominal and real terms, and pursued a policy toward North Korea that political scientist Dong Sun Lee called “threat deflation” despite the growing North Korean nuclear weapons threat.19 Economic crises can also spur strategic reassessment through another channel. If leaders view economic problems as structural, rather than a temporary gale, they may come to question whether available national resources are sufficient to confront all of the national threats identified in the past. This creates incentives to economize threats, seeking political settlements where possible in order to focus remaining resources on competitions that can be won. A concrete example: in 1904, the chancellor to the Exchequer wrote his cabinet colleagues: “[W]e must frankly admit that the financial resources of the United Kingdom are inadequate to do all that we should desire in the matter of Imperial defense.”20 The result was a British decision to minimize political disagreement with the United States and focus on other defense challenges. While such a decision is in line with realist advice, it occurred not when the power trajectories were evident to British decisionmakers but when the budget situation had reached a crisis that could no longer be ignored. Economic Downturns Increase Incentives for International Economic Cooperation Economic downturns not only create incentives to cut spending, they encourage vigorous pursuit of opportunities for economic cooperation. This, too, can engender conciliatory behavior. Economic downturns can increase motives to pursue trade and investment. Rivalries with old foes often directly impinge on trade and investment with the adversary and may indirectly impinge on trade and investment with third parties, especially if the rivalry is viewed as being likely to generate disruptive military conflict. Additionally, economic aid is sometimes used as an inducement for adversaries to set aside a political dispute. This aid can either serve as a side payment from one rival to another, or it can be offered by a third party to one or both rivals as an incentive to set aside lingering disputes. Such aid is more attractive during periods of economic turmoil than during periods of comparative normalcy. In South Asia, India and Pakistan struggled from 1947 to 1960 with how to manage water resources in the Indus Rivers basin, inheriting a canal system meant to service pre-partitioned India. Pakistan, suffering an economic downturn, and India, reliant on foreign aid to avert economic crisis, agreed to an Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 to resolve the lingering dispute, made possible in substantial part because of World Bank financing that was especially attractive to the struggling economies. In the Middle East, Egypt and Israel made the hard choices necessary for the Camp David accord in 1979 precisely because the Sadat and Begin governments faced difficult economic situations at home that made the U.S. aid guarantee in exchange for a peace agreement especially attractive.21 In 1982, the Yemen’s People’s Republic agreed to stop its attempts to destabilize Oman, because otherwise Yemen would not receive economic assistance from Arab oil producing states that it desperately needed.22 In the late 1990s, El Niño-induced flooding devastated Ecuador and Peru, spurring reconciliation as leaders sought to increase trade, secure investment, and slash military expenditures so they could be used at home.23 As one Western diplomat assessed at the time, Ecuador and Peru “have decided it's better to see reason…. They see foreign companies eager to invest in South America, and if Peru and Ecuador are in conflict, it makes them less attractive than, say, Argentina or Brazil or Chile for investment purposes. That's the last thing either country wants.”24 Economic Downturns Can Cause Meaningful Leadership Change The above mechanisms have identified how economic difficulties can alter the preferences of an incumbent leader. Additionally, economic crises can lead to leadership turnover and, during periods of difficulty, the selection process that determines new leadership can loosen ideological strictures that relate to extant rivalries. Leaders may be selected based on judgments about their ability to cope with economic problems, with greater elite acceptance of ideological heterogeneity in foreign policy beliefs than in periods of normalcy.25 In Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth’s words, “If everything is going well or is stable, then why select leaders who might subvert the triedand-true identity? But if that identity is leading to increased material difficulties, pressure for change will likely mount. In these circumstances, those who are willing to alter or adjust the hallowed precepts of the existing identity and its associated practices are more likely to assume power.”26 Economic crisis, then, can spur incumbent leaders to either abandon the “baggage” of rivalry or facilitate the selection of new leaders that do not carry such baggage. The most well-known example of an incumbent selectorate looking for a reformer, even one without much foreign policy experience, involves Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascension to the Soviet premiership. In political scientist Jerry Hough’s words, “If the rate of economic growth continued to decline, if administrative and labor efficiency continued to fall, if corruption was not punished, these conditions would have dangerous consequences for the [Soviet Union in the] 1980s and 1990s…. Gorbachev’s promotion was an answer to these concerns.”27",summarize the following text: ,"Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950 67 of which terminated the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes democratic status nuclear weapons capability imbalance common enemies  international systemic changes I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence generates incentives to curtail expenditure These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target welfare The politics of welfare state retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending There is a constituency for defense spending but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones.

Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict? Or might downturns encourage austerity and economizing behavior in foreign policy? This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals. For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition. Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy. This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international systemic changes), as well as many other possible confounding variables. This research questions existing theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace may result from economic troubles. I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely. Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely. In other words, rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically. This definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which “[b]oth actors view each other as a significant politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy.”2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage. Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this project’s empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry. Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels. (1) Economic crises lead to austerity pressures, which in turn incent leaders to search for ways to cut defense expenditures. (2) Economic crises also encourage strategic reassessment, so that leaders can argue to their peers and their publics that defense spending can be arrested without endangering the state. This can lead to threat deflation, where elites attempt to downplay the seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. (3) If a state faces multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to consider threat prioritization, a process that is postponed during periods of economic normalcy. (4) Economic crises increase the political and economic benefit from international economic cooperation. Leaders seek foreign aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad during periods of economic trouble. This search is made easier if tensions are reduced with historic rivals. (5) Finally, during crises, elites are more prone to select leaders who are perceived as capable of resolving economic difficulties, permitting the emergence of leaders who hold heterodox foreign policy views. Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy. This section reviews this causal logic in greater detail, while also providing historical examples that these mechanisms recur in practice. Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Economic crises generate pressure for austerity. Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish. Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable. When growth slowdowns are prolonged, the cumulative departure from planning targets can grow even further, even if no single quarter meets the technical definition of recession. Pressures for austerity are felt most acutely in governments that face difficulty borrowing to finance deficit expenditures. This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit. Even for states that can borrow, however, intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence—a belief in what is sometimes called “expansionary austerity”—generates incentives to curtail expenditure. These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target poverty alleviation, welfare programs, or economic subsidies. As a result, mass and elite constituents strongly resist such cuts. Welfare programs and other forms of public spending may be especially susceptible to a policy “ratchet effect,” where people are very reluctant to forego benefits once they have become accustomed to their availability.6 As Paul Pierson has argued, “The politics [of welfare state] retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters in return for diffuse and uncertain gains.”7 Austerity Leads to Cutbacks in Defense Spending At a minimum, the political costs of pursuing austerity through cutbacks in social and economic expenditures alone make such a path unappealing. In practice, this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil. There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget, and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public. Many militaries need foreign arms and foreign ammunition for their militaries, so defense expenditures are doubly costly since they both take up valuable defense budget space while also sending hard currency overseas, rather than constituencies at home. Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict even if that means policies of appeasement and conciliation.8 During periods of economic expansion, the opportunity costs associated with defense expenditure—the requirement for higher taxes or foregone spending in other areas—are real but acceptable. Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending. There is a constituency for defense spending in the armed services, intelligence agencies, and arms industries, but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones. Defense Cutbacks Encourage Rapprochement An interest in defense cutbacks can lead to conciliatory behavior through two paths. First, the cutbacks themselves serve as a concrete signal to adversaries that the military threat posed by the economically distressed state is declining. This permits the other state to halt that portion of defense spending dedicated to keeping up, breaking the back of ongoing arms races through reciprocated, but non-negotiated moves. Unilateral conventional force reductions were a major element of Gorbachev’s foreign policy in the late 1980s, alongside negotiated strategic arms control, and diplomatic efforts to achieve political understandings with the United States.9 Gorbachev similarly used force reductions in Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the Soviet Far East to signal to China in 1987 that he was serious about political negotiations.10 Elsewhere, non-negotiated, tit-for-tat military redeployments facilitated Argentina-Brazil rapprochement.11 Second, leaders may believe cutbacks are necessary, but would be dangerous in the absence of negotiated improvements with traditional foes. Economic downturns can serve as motivation to pursue arms control or political settlement. During periods of normalcy, such outcomes would be positives, but are viewed as “too hard” by political leaders that move from one urgent problem to the next. During periods of economic crisis, however, arms control or political improvements might allow for much needed cuts in defense spending, and are pursued with greater vigor. The Johnson administration attempted both unilateral and negotiated arms limitations because of budgetary concerns as President Johnson and Secretary McNamara struggled to pay for the “Great Society” domestic programs and the increasingly costly Vietnam War. They first attempted unilateral “caps” on costly nuclear forces and anti-ballistic missile defenses and when this failed to lead to a reciprocal Soviet response they engaged in formal arms control talks. Détente continued in the Nixon administration, accelerating in 1971 and 1972, simultaneous with rising budget deficits and inflation so serious that Nixon instituted price controls. Nixon’s decision to sharply limit anti-ballistic missile defenses to enable arms control talks was contrary to his strategic views, but necessitated by a difficult budgetary environment that made paying for more missile defense emplacements unrealistic.12 As Nixon told his national security advisor Kissinger in an April 1972 discussion of ballistic missile and anti-ballistic missile developments: “You know we've got a hell of a budget problem. We've got to cut it down, we've got to cut 5 billion dollars off next year's defense budget. So, I don't want to [inaudible: do it?] unless we've got some settlement with the Russians.”13 In practice, unilateral defense cuts and force reductions are frequently combined with negotiated political agreements in a sequential, iterative fashion, where a unilateral reduction will signal seriousness that opens the way for political agreement, which in turn permits even deeper reductions. Defense cuts and force reductions are not only a means to achieve rivalry termination, but also a goal in and of themselves that rivalry termination helps secure. Leaders are seeking resources from defense they can use elsewhere. Thus when Argentine leader Raul Alfonsín campaigned for the need for drastic budgetary austerity, his specific “platform was the reduction of military spending to use it for the other ministries, connected with the concept of eliminating the hypothesis of conflict” with Argentinian rivals, according to Adalberto Rodríguez Giavarini, who served in Alfonsín’s ministry of defense (and later was Argentina’s foreign minister).14 Similarly, Gorbachev was motivated to reduce arms in the late 1980s because he determined it was necessary to cut Soviet defense spending and defense production, and repurpose part of the defense industry to make consumer and civilian capital goods, according to contemporary U.S. Central Intelligence Agency classified assessments.15 Thus the “main reason” why strategic arms control breakthroughs occurred from 1986 to 1988 and the Soviet Afghan intervention concluded in 1989 was a realization within the Politburo of “excessively high expenditures on defense,” according to Nikolai Ryzhkov, Gorbachev’s prime minister.16 Economic Downturns Provoke Strategic Reassessment: Threat Deflation and Prioritization Economic downturns encourage leaders to seek new ideas to use to frame their policy problems. During periods of economic difficulty, elites can come to realize that their problems are not amenable to old solutions, and search for new ideas.17 During an economic crisis, politics and policy are “more fluid,” as old answers seem stale and insufficient.18 An ideational entrepreneur that can link economic lemons to foreign policy lemonade can find a patron when leaders are casting about for ways to reframe the world in acceptable ways to their peers and publics. The behavior of an old foe is often ambiguous, and can be viewed as either injurious to one’s interests or neutral toward them. During periods of normalcy, the motivation of defense establishments is tilted toward threat and danger. During periods of economic crisis, national leaders have a counteracting motivation to downplay such dangers, so that the threats faced by a nation are manageable through available resources. Economic difficulties provide a motivation for leaders to view equivocal signals from the international system in a way that is benign. To the extent that rivalries are perpetuated because of threat inflation, economic downturns provide incentives to deflate the threat, potentially disrupting cycles of competition and enmity. South Korean president Kim Dae-jong came to power in the aftermath of the 1998 Asian economic crisis, pursued a “sunshine policy” toward the North, cut South Korean defense spending in nominal and real terms, and pursued a policy toward North Korea that political scientist Dong Sun Lee called “threat deflation” despite the growing North Korean nuclear weapons threat.19 Economic crises can also spur strategic reassessment through another channel. If leaders view economic problems as structural, rather than a temporary gale, they may come to question whether available national resources are sufficient to confront all of the national threats identified in the past. This creates incentives to economize threats, seeking political settlements where possible in order to focus remaining resources on competitions that can be won. A concrete example: in 1904, the chancellor to the Exchequer wrote his cabinet colleagues: “[W]e must frankly admit that the financial resources of the United Kingdom are inadequate to do all that we should desire in the matter of Imperial defense.”20 The result was a British decision to minimize political disagreement with the United States and focus on other defense challenges. While such a decision is in line with realist advice, it occurred not when the power trajectories were evident to British decisionmakers but when the budget situation had reached a crisis that could no longer be ignored. Economic Downturns Increase Incentives for International Economic Cooperation Economic downturns not only create incentives to cut spending, they encourage vigorous pursuit of opportunities for economic cooperation. This, too, can engender conciliatory behavior. Economic downturns can increase motives to pursue trade and investment. Rivalries with old foes often directly impinge on trade and investment with the adversary and may indirectly impinge on trade and investment with third parties, especially if the rivalry is viewed as being likely to generate disruptive military conflict. Additionally, economic aid is sometimes used as an inducement for adversaries to set aside a political dispute. This aid can either serve as a side payment from one rival to another, or it can be offered by a third party to one or both rivals as an incentive to set aside lingering disputes. Such aid is more attractive during periods of economic turmoil than during periods of comparative normalcy. In South Asia, India and Pakistan struggled from 1947 to 1960 with how to manage water resources in the Indus Rivers basin, inheriting a canal system meant to service pre-partitioned India. Pakistan, suffering an economic downturn, and India, reliant on foreign aid to avert economic crisis, agreed to an Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 to resolve the lingering dispute, made possible in substantial part because of World Bank financing that was especially attractive to the struggling economies. In the Middle East, Egypt and Israel made the hard choices necessary for the Camp David accord in 1979 precisely because the Sadat and Begin governments faced difficult economic situations at home that made the U.S. aid guarantee in exchange for a peace agreement especially attractive.21 In 1982, the Yemen’s People’s Republic agreed to stop its attempts to destabilize Oman, because otherwise Yemen would not receive economic assistance from Arab oil producing states that it desperately needed.22 In the late 1990s, El Niño-induced flooding devastated Ecuador and Peru, spurring reconciliation as leaders sought to increase trade, secure investment, and slash military expenditures so they could be used at home.23 As one Western diplomat assessed at the time, Ecuador and Peru “have decided it's better to see reason…. They see foreign companies eager to invest in South America, and if Peru and Ecuador are in conflict, it makes them less attractive than, say, Argentina or Brazil or Chile for investment purposes. That's the last thing either country wants.”24 Economic Downturns Can Cause Meaningful Leadership Change The above mechanisms have identified how economic difficulties can alter the preferences of an incumbent leader. Additionally, economic crises can lead to leadership turnover and, during periods of difficulty, the selection process that determines new leadership can loosen ideological strictures that relate to extant rivalries. Leaders may be selected based on judgments about their ability to cope with economic problems, with greater elite acceptance of ideological heterogeneity in foreign policy beliefs than in periods of normalcy.25 In Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth’s words, “If everything is going well or is stable, then why select leaders who might subvert the triedand-true identity? But if that identity is leading to increased material difficulties, pressure for change will likely mount. In these circumstances, those who are willing to alter or adjust the hallowed precepts of the existing identity and its associated practices are more likely to assume power.”26 Economic crisis, then, can spur incumbent leaders to either abandon the “baggage” of rivalry or facilitate the selection of new leaders that do not carry such baggage. The most well-known example of an incumbent selectorate looking for a reformer, even one without much foreign policy experience, involves Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascension to the Soviet premiership. In political scientist Jerry Hough’s words, “If the rate of economic growth continued to decline, if administrative and labor efficiency continued to fall, if corruption was not punished, these conditions would have dangerous consequences for the [Soviet Union in the] 1980s and 1990s…. Gorbachev’s promotion was an answer to these concerns.”27",summarize the following text: ,"Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950 67 of which terminated the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes democratic status nuclear weapons capability imbalance common enemies  international systemic changes I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence generates incentives to curtail expenditure These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target welfare The politics of welfare state retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending There is a constituency for defense spending but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones.

"In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force was now economically futile as international finance and trade had become so interconnected that harming the enemy’s property would equate to harming your own.[1] A year later Europe’s economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the First World War. Almost a century later Steven Pinker made a similar claim. Pinker argues, “Though the relationship between America and China is far from warm, we are unlikely to declare war on them or vice versa. Morality aside, they make too much of our stuff and we owe them too much money.”[2] His argument rests upon the liberal assumption that high levels of trade and investment between two states, in this case the US and China, will make war unlikely, if not impossible. It is this assumption that this essay seeks to evaluate.
This essay is divided into three sections. The first briefly outlines the theory that economic interdependence results in a reduced likelihood of conflict, breaking the theory down into smaller components that can be examined. In the second section, this essay suggests that the premise ‘more trade equals less conflict’ is simplistic. It does not take into account many of the variables that can influence the strength of economic interdependence’s conflict reducing attributes. Within this section, the essay considers: the extent to which conflict cuts off trade, theories arguing that how and what a state trades matters, Copeland’s theory of trade expectations and the differences between status quo and revisionist states. The final section deals with the realist perspective, concentrating on arguments pertaining to the primacy of strategic interests and arguments that economic interdependence will increase the likelihood of conflict owing to a reduction of deterrence credibility. Each section will be related back to the US-China relationship with a view to assessing Pinker’s claim. The essay will conclude that economic interdependence does reduce the likelihood of conflict but is insufficient on its own to completely prevent it. To calculate the likelihood of conflict correctly one would need to factor in the nature of the economic interdependence alongside the strength of the strategic interests at stake.
Economic Interdependence and Conflict
The theory that increased economic interdependence reduces conflict rests on three observations: trade benefits states in a manner that decision-makers value; conflict will reduce or completely cut-off trade; and that decision-makers will take the previous two observations into account before choosing to go to war. Based on these observations, one should expect that the higher the benefit of trade, the higher the cost of a potential conflict. After a certain point, the value of trade may become so high that the state in question has become economically dependent on another. Proponents of this theory argue that if two states have reached this point of mutual dependence (interdependence), their decision-makers will value the continuation of trade relations higher than any potential gains to be made through war.[3] It is on this argument that Pinker rests his statement that the economic relationship between the US and China precludes war. One can see evidence of this when analysing US views on China as trade rises. A 2014 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey indicates that only a minority of Americans see China as a critical threat, compared to a majority in the mid-1990s. This number is even higher when analysing Americans who directly benefit from trade with China.[4]
As compelling as this argument may be, high levels of economic interdependence have not always resulted in peace. The decades preceding WW1 saw an unprecedented growth in international trade, communication, and interconnectivity but needless to say, war broke out.[5] This instance alone is not enough to disprove Pinker’s logic. War may become very unlikely but began nonetheless.[6] Let us take two hypothetical scenarios, one in which the chances of war is 80% and the other in which trade has reduced the likelihood of war to 10%. Just knowing that war did indeed take place does not tell us which scenario was in play. Similarly, the fact that WW1 took place gives us no information about whether economic interdependence made war unlikely or not. In fact, evidence even exists to suggest that economic linkages prevented a war from breaking out during the sequence of crises that led up to WW1.[7] However, the fact that a war as detrimental as WW1 could break out despite a supposed reduction of the likelihood of conflict gives us an impetus to examine whether this reduction does take place. Additionally, if this is the case, what variables can weaken this pacifying effect?
Does Conflict Cut off Trade?
Economic interdependence theory makes the assumption that conflict will reduce or cut-off trade. This assumption appears to be logical, as one would expect that the moment two states are officially adversaries, fear of relative gains would ensure that policy makers want to completely cut-off trade. However, there are many historical examples of trade between warring states carrying on during wartime, including strategic goods that directly affect the ability of the enemy to carry out the war.[8] For example, in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, British insurance companies continued to insure enemy ships and paid to replace ships that were being destroyed by their own army.[9] Even during WW2, there are numerous examples of American firms continuing to trade strategic goods with Nazi Germany.[10] Barbieri and Levy argue that these examples and their own statistical analysis suggest that the outbreak of war does not radically reduce trade between enemies, and when it does, it often quickly returns to pre-war levels after the war has concluded.[11]
In response to this result, Anderton and Carter conducted an interrupted time-series study on the effect war has on trade in which they analysed 14 major power wars and 13 non-major power wars. Seven of the non-major power wars negatively impacted trade (although only four of these reductions were significant), but in the major war category, all results bar one showed a reduction of trade during wartime and a quick return to pre-war levels at its conclusion.[12] Accompanying this contradictory finding one must take into account that even if war does not radically reduce trade, if a state believes that it does then potential opportunity cost would still figure in their calculations.
Variables that Impact the Pacifying Effect of Economic Interdependence
The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is not constant. It achieves this via a discussion of the effect of changes in a number of variables pertaining to how and what a state trades. Once it is established that changes in such variables may alter the effect of economic interdependence on the likelihood of conflict, Pinker’s statement (that the level of trade between the US and China makes conflict unlikely) can be considered to be an over-simplification.
One variable is the relative levels of economic dependence. Some argue that asymmetry of trade can increase the chances of conflict if the trade is more important to one state than it is to the other; their resolve would not be reduced by the same degree. The less dependent state would be far more willing than its adversary to initiate a conflict.[13] An example is the possibility of the prevalent idea in China that ‘Japan needs China more than China needs Japan’ leading to China becoming more assertive in Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute.[14] It is important to recognize that all trade is asymmetric in one fashion or another. It is radical asymmetry that one has to fear, which at the moment does not appear to be the case in the China-Japan or US-China case.
Another variable is the specifics of what is being traded. A study by Dorussen suggests that the pacifying effect of trade is less evident if the trade consists of raw materials and agriculture but stronger if the trade consists of manufactured goods. Even within the category of manufactured goods there are differences in effect. Mass consumer goods yield the strongest pacifying results whilst high-technology sectors such as electronics and highly capital-intensive sectors such as transport and metal industries tend to have a relatively weak effect.[15] If it is a sector with alternative trade avenues then embargos and boycotts as a result of conflict will have far less effect.[16] The rule is that the more inelastic the import demand, the higher the opportunity cost and the smaller the probability of conflict.[17] According to these studies, trade still generally reduces the likelihood of conflict however it is by no means homogeneous in its effects. Additionally, the opportunity costs are not the same for importers and exporters. Dorussen’s study suggests that increased trade in oil tends to make the exporters more hostile and the importers friendlier in relations to their foreign policy.[18] Taking this framework into account, in 2014 China’s top five exports to the US (computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones and office machine parts) all fell under the category of electronics,[19] whilst the US’s top five exports to China (air and/or spacecraft, soybeans, cars, integrated circuits and scrap copper) were all either high-capital intensive sectors or raw materials and agriculture.[20] According to Dorussen’s study, these exports should not yield the strongest possible conflict reducing results, which could impact the validity of Pinker’s statement.
Copeland presents another variable, namely expectations of trade. Copeland argues that if a highly dependent state expects future trade to be high, decision makers will behave as many liberals predict and treat war as a less appealing option. However if there are low expectations of future trade, then a highly dependent state will attach a low or even negative value to continued peaceful relations and war would become more likely.[21] As an example, he points out that despite high levels of trade in 1914 German leaders believed that rival great powers would attempt to undermine this trade in the future, so a war to secure control over raw materials was in the interests of German long-term security.[22] Via this framework, if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less dependent on China’s economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the probability of conflict.
The final variable this essay will discuss relates to the differences between status quo and revisionist states. Most empirical analyses of economic interdependence tend to group together states as different as the United States, Pakistan, Australia, Germany and China and assume that variations in their behaviour would be the same.[23] Papayoanou on the other hand, argues that when analysing the effects of economic interdependence it is useful to differentiate the effects on great power states and states with revisionist aspirations.[24] If a status quo power has strong economic ties with revisionist state there will be interest groups who advocate engagement and who believe that confrontational stances will threaten the political foundation of economic links. This will constrain the response of the status quo state.[25] One can see evidence of such an interest group in the US, a group Friedberg describes as the Shanghai coalition, who he argues advocate engagement with China at the expense of balancing.[26] A study by Fordham and Kleinberg backs up this argument as they find that US business elites who benefit from trade with China tend to see little benefit in limiting the growth of Chinese power.[27] A 21st Century revisionist power is far less likely to be a democracy, and therefore, interest groups will influence the leadership far less. This means an authoritarian revisionist power will be working under fewer constraints and will be able to take a more aggressive stance.[28] This appears to be the case in China where rather than having domestic constraints on taking an aggressive stance against Japan, one of their biggest trading partners, grassroots nationalism has made explicit cooperation a domestically risky option.[29]
There are many indicators to suggest that China is a revisionist power willing to wage war. Lemke and Werner argue that an extraordinary growth of military expenditures’ reveals when a state is dissatisfied with the status quo.[30] Data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute certainly indicates that China qualifies as its military expenditure has nominally increased by 1270% between 1995 and 2015.[31] Additionally, the military modernization appears to be aimed at capabilities to contest US primacy in East Asia.[32] Much like German strategists recognized that Britain was operating under significant domestic constraints, China could realize the same of the US.[33] This is not to say that Chinese decision-makers would be cavalier about making a decision that would be to the detriment its economy. A crash in the Chinese economy due to the loss of exports to the US could potentially undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and endanger the regime. However, the view that China is a revisionist power indicates that good trade relations alone will not result in a low probability of conflict.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to Dominance of Strategic Interests
Having established that if the pacifying effect of trade does exist, it can rise or fall depending on changes in a series of variables this essay proceeds to deal with realist theories arguing that trade has a negligible or even negative effect on the likelihood of conflict. Buzan argues that noneconomic factors contribute far more to major phenomena than liberal theorists usually cite to support their theory.[34] There is evidence of the primacy of strategic interests in Masterson’s 2012 study on the relationship between China’s economic interdependence and political relations with its neighbours. The study concluded that as economic interdependence with neighbouring states increased the likelihood of conflict did indeed decrease, but that the impact was minimal when compared to the impact of relative power capabilities. In other words, political and military issues dominated
interstate relations. Growth in power disparities were associated with decreases in dyadic political relations that were greater than the increase caused by economic interdependence.[35]
If the pacifying effect of trade can rise and fall so can the provocative effect of strategic interests. It is important to distinguish between the existence of a strategic interest and a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability. China and the US have many opposing strategic interests, but neither is in a strategically vulnerable position. For example, China shares many borders, but none present the same threat of invasion that Tsarist Russia did to Imperial Germany as none of the current maritime tensions between China, Japan, and the US equate to a matter of national survival.[36] This is crucial as some believe that for a crisis to escalate to a major war an actor who is isolated and believes that history is conspiring against them is needed. Only this actor would take an existential risk to try and offset their strategic vulnerability.[37] Imperial Germany fit this description, but neither China nor the US does. This is largely due to the geography of the region. The tension between the US, China and Japan are over maritime regions. Maritime issues still relate to national interests but, as Krause points out, “Land armies are still the only forces that can conquer and hold territory.”[38] Taking this into account one can argue that the benefits of US-China trade are, for each state, currently greater than the benefits of pursing strategic benefits via force, but this situation will only remain as long as the situation does not become one of unbearable strategic vulnerability.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to the Undermining of Deterrence
Having established that scenarios exist where strategic interests and vulnerabilities have a greater effect on the likelihood of war than economic interdependence, this essay will now evaluate arguments that economic interdependence can increase the likelihood of conflict through the undermining of deterrence. The argument proceeds as follows: if economic interdependence constrains the ability or willingness of a state to use its military, security is lowered as the state now has a weakened ability to engage in deterrence and defensive alliances. Deterrence relies on the ability of a state to make credible threats and defensive alliances rely on credible promises to protect one’s allies.[39] Credibility is defined as the product of the operational capability to follow through with a threat and the communication of resolve to use force.[40] What is at risk here is that if economic interconnectivity interferes with the communication of resolve to use force then states may end up with a way that neither side expected or wanted.
Some argue that it was such a failure to communicate resolve that resulted in the beginning of WW1. Indeed, Jolly claims that: “The Austrians had believed that vigorous actions against Serbia and a promise of German support would deter Russia: the Russians had believed that a show of strength against Austria would both check the Austrians and deter Germany. In both cases, the bluff had been called and the three countries were faced with the military consequences of their actions.”[41] The risk in the US-China case would be that the interest groups described earlier would prevent the US from effectively communicating its resolve to use force if China were to cross a redline. The flaw in this argument lies in the fact that whilst interest groups might push back against public statements outlining redlines; the US has many less overt options available to it to communicate resolve. Modern technology and the forms of interconnectivity have resulted in many more lines of communication between China and the US than adversaries had access to in 1914. Private meetings, electronic communication and numerous other methods of communication have the capability to be candid without being visible to interest groups. It is for this reason that this essay discounts the theory that Sino-American economic interdependence results in a reduction of deterrence and therefore increases the likelihood of conflict.
Conclusion
This essay has shown that the strength of the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is subject to change depending on a series of dynamic variables. It has also demonstrated that the strength of the conflict provoking effects of strategic interests can change depending on whether the strategic interest amounts to a situation of unbearable strategic vulnerability. It has discounted the theory that interdependence leads to a higher chance of conflict through an erosion of credibility. To sum up, trade does seem to reduce the likelihood of conflict but should not be seen as a deterministic factor as strategic interests, and vulnerabilities also have a large effect. There is no hard rule as to what will be the driving factor as the nature of economic interdependence and of strategic factors impact their relative values.
Accordingly, Pinker’s statement that the trade between the US and China makes war exceptionally unlikely is simplistic and misleading because it fails to account for a wide array of variables that can radically change the likelihood of a Sino-American war. An intellectually honest thesis would insist upon a comprehensive approach in which the level of economic activity is simply one of many variables that is required.",summarize the following text: ,"In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force was economically futile as trade had become so interconnected A year later World War the liberal assumption that high levels of trade make war unlikely

another variable expectations of trade if there are low expectations of future trade a highly dependent state will attach a low or even negative value to continued peaceful relations if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less dependent on China’s economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the probability of conflict.

"In 1913, Norman Angell declared that the use of military force was now economically futile as international finance and trade had become so interconnected that harming the enemy’s property would equate to harming your own.[1] A year later Europe’s economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the First World War. Almost a century later Steven Pinker made a similar claim. Pinker argues, “Though the relationship between America and China is far from warm, we are unlikely to declare war on them or vice versa. Morality aside, they make too much of our stuff and we owe them too much money.”[2] His argument rests upon the liberal assumption that high levels of trade and investment between two states, in this case the US and China, will make war unlikely, if not impossible. It is this assumption that this essay seeks to evaluate.
This essay is divided into three sections. The first briefly outlines the theory that economic interdependence results in a reduced likelihood of conflict, breaking the theory down into smaller components that can be examined. In the second section, this essay suggests that the premise ‘more trade equals less conflict’ is simplistic. It does not take into account many of the variables that can influence the strength of economic interdependence’s conflict reducing attributes. Within this section, the essay considers: the extent to which conflict cuts off trade, theories arguing that how and what a state trades matters, Copeland’s theory of trade expectations and the differences between status quo and revisionist states. The final section deals with the realist perspective, concentrating on arguments pertaining to the primacy of strategic interests and arguments that economic interdependence will increase the likelihood of conflict owing to a reduction of deterrence credibility. Each section will be related back to the US-China relationship with a view to assessing Pinker’s claim. The essay will conclude that economic interdependence does reduce the likelihood of conflict but is insufficient on its own to completely prevent it. To calculate the likelihood of conflict correctly one would need to factor in the nature of the economic interdependence alongside the strength of the strategic interests at stake.
Economic Interdependence and Conflict
The theory that increased economic interdependence reduces conflict rests on three observations: trade benefits states in a manner that decision-makers value; conflict will reduce or completely cut-off trade; and that decision-makers will take the previous two observations into account before choosing to go to war. Based on these observations, one should expect that the higher the benefit of trade, the higher the cost of a potential conflict. After a certain point, the value of trade may become so high that the state in question has become economically dependent on another. Proponents of this theory argue that if two states have reached this point of mutual dependence (interdependence), their decision-makers will value the continuation of trade relations higher than any potential gains to be made through war.[3] It is on this argument that Pinker rests his statement that the economic relationship between the US and China precludes war. One can see evidence of this when analysing US views on China as trade rises. A 2014 Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey indicates that only a minority of Americans see China as a critical threat, compared to a majority in the mid-1990s. This number is even higher when analysing Americans who directly benefit from trade with China.[4]
As compelling as this argument may be, high levels of economic interdependence have not always resulted in peace. The decades preceding WW1 saw an unprecedented growth in international trade, communication, and interconnectivity but needless to say, war broke out.[5] This instance alone is not enough to disprove Pinker’s logic. War may become very unlikely but began nonetheless.[6] Let us take two hypothetical scenarios, one in which the chances of war is 80% and the other in which trade has reduced the likelihood of war to 10%. Just knowing that war did indeed take place does not tell us which scenario was in play. Similarly, the fact that WW1 took place gives us no information about whether economic interdependence made war unlikely or not. In fact, evidence even exists to suggest that economic linkages prevented a war from breaking out during the sequence of crises that led up to WW1.[7] However, the fact that a war as detrimental as WW1 could break out despite a supposed reduction of the likelihood of conflict gives us an impetus to examine whether this reduction does take place. Additionally, if this is the case, what variables can weaken this pacifying effect?
Does Conflict Cut off Trade?
Economic interdependence theory makes the assumption that conflict will reduce or cut-off trade. This assumption appears to be logical, as one would expect that the moment two states are officially adversaries, fear of relative gains would ensure that policy makers want to completely cut-off trade. However, there are many historical examples of trade between warring states carrying on during wartime, including strategic goods that directly affect the ability of the enemy to carry out the war.[8] For example, in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, British insurance companies continued to insure enemy ships and paid to replace ships that were being destroyed by their own army.[9] Even during WW2, there are numerous examples of American firms continuing to trade strategic goods with Nazi Germany.[10] Barbieri and Levy argue that these examples and their own statistical analysis suggest that the outbreak of war does not radically reduce trade between enemies, and when it does, it often quickly returns to pre-war levels after the war has concluded.[11]
In response to this result, Anderton and Carter conducted an interrupted time-series study on the effect war has on trade in which they analysed 14 major power wars and 13 non-major power wars. Seven of the non-major power wars negatively impacted trade (although only four of these reductions were significant), but in the major war category, all results bar one showed a reduction of trade during wartime and a quick return to pre-war levels at its conclusion.[12] Accompanying this contradictory finding one must take into account that even if war does not radically reduce trade, if a state believes that it does then potential opportunity cost would still figure in their calculations.
Variables that Impact the Pacifying Effect of Economic Interdependence
The purpose of this section is to demonstrate that the pacifying effect of economic interdependence is not constant. It achieves this via a discussion of the effect of changes in a number of variables pertaining to how and what a state trades. Once it is established that changes in such variables may alter the effect of economic interdependence on the likelihood of conflict, Pinker’s statement (that the level of trade between the US and China makes conflict unlikely) can be considered to be an over-simplification.
One variable is the relative levels of economic dependence. Some argue that asymmetry of trade can increase the chances of conflict if the trade is more important to one state than it is to the other; their resolve would not be reduced by the same degree. The less dependent state would be far more willing than its adversary to initiate a conflict.[13] An example is the possibility of the prevalent idea in China that ‘Japan needs China more than China needs Japan’ leading to China becoming more assertive in Senkaku/Diaoyu islands dispute.[14] It is important to recognize that all trade is asymmetric in one fashion or another. It is radical asymmetry that one has to fear, which at the moment does not appear to be the case in the China-Japan or US-China case.
Another variable is the specifics of what is being traded. A study by Dorussen suggests that the pacifying effect of trade is less evident if the trade consists of raw materials and agriculture but stronger if the trade consists of manufactured goods. Even within the category of manufactured goods there are differences in effect. Mass consumer goods yield the strongest pacifying results whilst high-technology sectors such as electronics and highly capital-intensive sectors such as transport and metal industries tend to have a relatively weak effect.[15] If it is a sector with alternative trade avenues then embargos and boycotts as a result of conflict will have far less effect.[16] The rule is that the more inelastic the import demand, the higher the opportunity cost and the smaller the probability of conflict.[17] According to these studies, trade still generally reduces the likelihood of conflict however it is by no means homogeneous in its effects. Additionally, the opportunity costs are not the same for importers and exporters. Dorussen’s study suggests that increased trade in oil tends to make the exporters more hostile and the importers friendlier in relations to their foreign policy.[18] Taking this framework into account, in 2014 China’s top five exports to the US (computers, broadcasting equipment, telephones and office machine parts) all fell under the category of electronics,[19] whilst the US’s top five exports to China (air and/or spacecraft, soybeans, cars, integrated circuits and scrap copper) were all either high-capital intensive sectors or raw materials and agriculture.[20] According to Dorussen’s study, these exports should not yield the strongest possible conflict reducing results, which could impact the validity of Pinker’s statement.
Copeland presents another variable, namely expectations of trade. Copeland argues that if a highly dependent state expects future trade to be high, decision makers will behave as many liberals predict and treat war as a less appealing option. However if there are low expectations of future trade, then a highly dependent state will attach a low or even negative value to continued peace
ful relations and war would become more likely.[21] As an example, he points out that despite high levels of trade in 1914 German leaders believed that rival great powers would attempt to undermine this trade in the future, so a war to secure control over raw materials was in the interests of German long-term security.[22] Via this framework, if the US began to believe that in future years they would be less dependent on China’s economy, or if it became apparent that a US-China trade war was about to take place, there would be a sharp rise in the probability of conflict.
The final variable this essay will discuss relates to the differences between status quo and revisionist states. Most empirical analyses of economic interdependence tend to group together states as different as the United States, Pakistan, Australia, Germany and China and assume that variations in their behaviour would be the same.[23] Papayoanou on the other hand, argues that when analysing the effects of economic interdependence it is useful to differentiate the effects on great power states and states with revisionist aspirations.[24] If a status quo power has strong economic ties with revisionist state there will be interest groups who advocate engagement and who believe that confrontational stances will threaten the political foundation of economic links. This will constrain the response of the status quo state.[25] One can see evidence of such an interest group in the US, a group Friedberg describes as the Shanghai coalition, who he argues advocate engagement with China at the expense of balancing.[26] A study by Fordham and Kleinberg backs up this argument as they find that US business elites who benefit from trade with China tend to see little benefit in limiting the growth of Chinese power.[27] A 21st Century revisionist power is far less likely to be a democracy, and therefore, interest groups will influence the leadership far less. This means an authoritarian revisionist power will be working under fewer constraints and will be able to take a more aggressive stance.[28] This appears to be the case in China where rather than having domestic constraints on taking an aggressive stance against Japan, one of their biggest trading partners, grassroots nationalism has made explicit cooperation a domestically risky option.[29]

Lemke and Werner argue that an extraordinary growth of military expenditures’ reveals when a state is dissatisfied with the status quo.[30] Data provided by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute certainly indicates that China qualifies as its military expenditure has nominally increased by 1270% between 1995 and 2015.[31] Additionally, the military modernization appears to be aimed at capabilities to contest US primacy in East Asia.[32] Much like German strategists recognized that Britain was operating under significant domestic constraints, China could realize the same of the US.[33] This is not to say that Chinese decision-makers would be cavalier about making a decision that would be to the detriment its economy. A crash in the Chinese economy due to the loss of exports to the US could potentially undermine the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist party and endanger the regime. However, the view that China is a revisionist power indicates that good trade relations alone will not result in a low probability of conflict.
Realist Arguments Pertaining to Dominance of Strategic Interests

Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict? Or might downturns encourage austerity and economizing behavior in foreign policy? This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals. For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition. Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy. This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international systemic changes), as well as many other possible confounding variables. This research questions existing theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace may result from economic troubles. I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely. Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely. In other words, rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically. This definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which “[b]oth actors view each other as a significant politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy.”2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage. Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this project’s empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry. Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels. (1) Economic crises lead to austerity pressures, which in turn incent leaders to search for ways to cut defense expenditures. (2) Economic crises also encourage strategic reassessment, so that leaders can argue to their peers and their publics that defense spending can be arrested without endangering the state. This can lead to threat deflation, where elites attempt to downplay the seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. (3) If a state faces multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to consider threat prioritization, a process that is postponed during periods of economic normalcy. (4) Economic crises increase the political and economic benefit from international economic cooperation. Leaders seek foreign aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad during periods of economic trouble. This search is made easier if tensions are reduced with historic rivals. (5) Finally, during crises, elites are more prone to select leaders who are perceived as capable of resolving economic difficulties, permitting the emergence of leaders who hold heterodox foreign policy views. Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy. This section reviews this causal logic in greater detail, while also providing historical examples that these mechanisms recur in practice. Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Economic crises generate pressure for austerity. Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish. Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable. When growth slowdowns are prolonged, the cumulative departure from planning targets can grow even further, even if no single quarter meets the technical definition of recession. Pressures for austerity are felt most acutely in governments that face difficulty borrowing to finance deficit expenditures. This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit. Even for states that can borrow, however, intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence—a belief in what is sometimes called “expansionary austerity”—generates incentives to curtail expenditure. These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target poverty alleviation, welfare programs, or economic subsidies. As a result, mass and elite constituents strongly resist such cuts. Welfare programs and other forms of public spending may be especially susceptible to a policy “ratchet effect,” where people are very reluctant to forego benefits once they have become accustomed to their availability.6 As Paul Pierson has argued, “The politics [of welfare state] retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters in return for diffuse and uncertain gains.”7 Austerity Leads to Cutbacks in Defense Spending At a minimum, the political costs of pursuing austerity through cutbacks in social and economic expenditures alone make such a path unappealing. In practice, this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil. There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget, and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public. Many militaries need foreign arms and foreign ammunition for their militaries, so defense expenditures are doubly costly since they both take up valuable defense budget space while also sending hard currency overseas, rather than constituencies at home. Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict even if that means policies of appeasement and conciliation.8 During periods of economic expansion, the opportunity costs associated with defense expenditure—the requirement for higher taxes or foregone spending in other areas—are real but acceptable. Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending. There is a constituency for defense spending in the armed services, intelligence agencies, and arms industries, but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones. Defense Cutbacks Encourage Rapprochement An interest in defense cutbacks can lead to conciliatory behavior through two paths. First, the cutbacks themselves serve as a concrete signal to adversaries that the military threat posed by the economically distressed state is declining. This permits the other state to halt that portion of defense spending dedicated to keeping up, breaking the back of ongoing arms races through reciprocated, but non-negotiated moves. Unilateral conventional force reductions were a major element of Gorbachev’s foreign policy in the late 1980s, alongside negotiated strategic arms control, and diplomatic efforts to achieve political understandings with the United States.9 Gorbachev similarly used force reductions in Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the Soviet Far East to signal to China in 1987 that he was serious about political negotiations.10 Elsewhere, non-negotiated, tit-for-tat military redeployments facilitated Argentina-Brazil rapprochement.11 Second, leaders may believe cutbacks are necessary, but would be dangerous in the absence of negotiated improvements with traditional foes. Economic downturns can serve as motivation to pursue arms control or political settlement. During periods of normalcy, such outcomes would be positives, but are viewed as “too hard” by political leaders that move from one urgent problem to the next. During periods of economic crisis, however, arms control or political improvements might allow for much needed cuts in defense spending, and are pursued with greater vigor. The Johnson administration attempted both unilateral and negotiated arms limitations because of budgetary concerns as President Johnson and Secretary McNamara struggled to pay for the “Great Society” domestic programs and the increasingly costly Vietnam War. They first attempted unilateral “caps” on costly nuclear forces and anti-ballistic missile defenses and when this failed to lead to a reciprocal Soviet response they engaged in formal arms control talks. Détente continued in the Nixon administration, accelerating in 1971 and 1972, simultaneous with rising budget deficits and inflation so serious that Nixon instituted price controls. Nixon’s decision to sharply limit anti-ballistic missile defenses to enable arms control talks was contrary to his strategic views, but necessitated by a difficult budgetary environment that made paying for more missile defense emplacements unrealistic.12 As Nixon told his national security advisor Kissinger in an April 1972 discussion of ballistic missile and anti-ballistic missile developments: “You know we've got a hell of a budget problem. We've got to cut it down, we've got to cut 5 billion dollars off next year's defense budget. So, I don't want to [inaudible: do it?] unless we've got some settlement with the Russians.”13 In practice, unilateral defense cuts and force reductions are frequently combined with negotiated political agreements in a sequential, iterative fashion, where a unilateral reduction will signal seriousness that opens the way for political agreement, which in turn permits even deeper reductions. Defense cuts and force reductions are not only a means to achieve rivalry termination, but also a goal in and of themselves that rivalry termination helps secure. Leaders are seeking resources from defense they can use elsewhere. Thus when Argentine leader Raul Alfonsín campaigned for the need for drastic budgetary austerity, his specific “platform was the reduction of military spending to use it for the other ministries, connected with the concept of eliminating the hypothesis of conflict” with Argentinian rivals, according to Adalberto Rodríguez Giavarini, who served in Alfonsín’s ministry of defense (and later was Argentina’s foreign minister).14 Similarly, Gorbachev was motivated to reduce arms in the late 1980s because he determined it was necessary to cut Soviet defense spending and defense production, and repurpose part of the defense industry to make consumer and civilian capital goods, according to contemporary U.S. Central Intelligence Agency classified assessments.15 Thus the “main reason” why strategic arms control breakthroughs occurred from 1986 to 1988 and the Soviet Afghan intervention concluded in 1989 was a realization within the Politburo of “excessively high expenditures on defense,” according to Nikolai Ryzhkov, Gorbachev’s prime minister.16 Economic Downturns Provoke Strategic Reassessment: Threat Deflation and Prioritization Economic downturns encourage leaders to seek new ideas to use to frame their policy problems. During periods of economic difficulty, elites can come to realize that their problems are not amenable to old solutions, and search for new ideas.17 During an economic crisis, politics and policy are “more fluid,” as old answers seem stale and insufficient.18 An ideational entrepreneur that can link economic lemons to foreign policy lemonade can find a patron when leaders are casting about for ways to reframe the world in acceptable ways to their peers and publics. The behavior of an old foe is often ambiguous, and can be viewed as either injurious to one’s interests or neutral toward them. During periods of normalcy, the motivation of defense establishments is tilted toward threat and danger. During periods of economic crisis, national leaders have a counteracting motivation to downplay such dangers, so that the threats faced by a nation are manageable through available resources. Economic difficulties provide a motivation for leaders to view equivocal signals from the international system in a way that is benign. To the extent that rivalries are perpetuated because of threat inflation, economic downturns provide incentives to deflate the threat, potentially disrupting cycles of competition and enmity. South Korean president Kim Dae-jong came to power in the aftermath of the 1998 Asian economic crisis, pursued a “sunshine policy” toward the North, cut South Korean defense spending in nominal and real terms, and pursued a policy toward North Korea that political scientist Dong Sun Lee called “threat deflation” despite the growing North Korean nuclear weapons threat.19 Economic crises can also spur strategic reassessment through another channel. If leaders view economic problems as structural, rather than a temporary gale, they may come to question whether available national resources are sufficient to confront all of the national threats identified in the past. This creates incentives to economize threats, seeking political settlements where possible in order to focus remaining resources on competitions that can be won. A concrete example: in 1904, the chancellor to the Exchequer wrote his cabinet colleagues: “[W]e must frankly admit that the financial resources of the United Kingdom are inadequate to do all that we should desire in the matter of Imperial defense.”20 The result was a British decision to minimize political disagreement with the United States and focus on other defense challenges. While such a decision is in line with realist advice, it occurred not when the power trajectories were evident to British decisionmakers but when the budget situation had reached a crisis that could no longer be ignored. Economic Downturns Increase Incentives for International Economic Cooperation Economic downturns not only create incentives to cut spending, they encourage vigorous pursuit of opportunities for economic cooperation. This, too, can engender conciliatory behavior. Economic downturns can increase motives to pursue trade and investment. Rivalries with old foes often directly impinge on trade and investment with the adversary and may indirectly impinge on trade and investment with third parties, especially if the rivalry is viewed as being likely to generate disruptive military conflict. Additionally, economic aid is sometimes used as an inducement for adversaries to set aside a political dispute. This aid can either serve as a side payment from one rival to another, or it can be offered by a third party to one or both rivals as an incentive to set aside lingering disputes. Such aid is more attractive during periods of economic turmoil than during periods of comparative normalcy. In South Asia, India and Pakistan struggled from 1947 to 1960 with how to manage water resources in the Indus Rivers basin, inheriting a canal system meant to service pre-partitioned India. Pakistan, suffering an economic downturn, and India, reliant on foreign aid to avert economic crisis, agreed to an Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 to resolve the lingering dispute, made possible in substantial part because of World Bank financing that was especially attractive to the struggling economies. In the Middle East, Egypt and Israel made the hard choices necessary for the Camp David accord in 1979 precisely because the Sadat and Begin governments faced difficult economic situations at home that made the U.S. aid guarantee in exchange for a peace agreement especially attractive.21 In 1982, the Yemen’s People’s Republic agreed to stop its attempts to destabilize Oman, because otherwise Yemen would not receive economic assistance from Arab oil producing states that it desperately needed.22 In the late 1990s, El Niño-induced flooding devastated Ecuador and Peru, spurring reconciliation as leaders sought to increase trade, secure investment, and slash military expenditures so they could be used at home.23 As one Western diplomat assessed at the time, Ecuador and Peru “have decided it's better to see reason…. They see foreign companies eager to invest in South America, and if Peru and Ecuador are in conflict, it makes them less attractive than, say, Argentina or Brazil or Chile for investment purposes. That's the last thing either country wants.”24 Economic Downturns Can Cause Meaningful Leadership Change The above mechanisms have identified how economic difficulties can alter the preferences of an incumbent leader. Additionally, economic crises can lead to leadership turnover and, during periods of difficulty, the selection process that determines new leadership can loosen ideological strictures that relate to extant rivalries. Leaders may be selected based on judgments about their ability to cope with economic problems, with greater elite acceptance of ideological heterogeneity in foreign policy beliefs than in periods of normalcy.25 In Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth’s words, “If everything is going well or is stable, then why select leaders who might subvert the triedand-true identity? But if that identity is leading to increased material difficulties, pressure for change will likely mount. In these circumstances, those who are willing to alter or adjust the hallowed precepts of the existing identity and its associated practices are more likely to assume power.”26 Economic crisis, then, can spur incumbent leaders to either abandon the “baggage” of rivalry or facilitate the selection of new leaders that do not carry such baggage. The most well-known example of an incumbent selectorate looking for a reformer, even one without much foreign policy experience, involves Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascension to the Soviet premiership. In political scientist Jerry Hough’s words, “If the rate of economic growth continued to decline, if administrative and labor efficiency continued to fall, if corruption was not punished, these conditions would have dangerous consequences for the [Soviet Union in the] 1980s and 1990s…. Gorbachev’s promotion was an answer to these concerns.”27",summarize the following text: ,"Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950 67 of which terminated the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes democratic status nuclear weapons capability imbalance common enemies  international systemic changes I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence generates incentives to curtail expenditure These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target welfare The politics of welfare state retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending There is a constituency for defense spending but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones.

Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict? Or might downturns encourage austerity and economizing behavior in foreign policy? This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals. For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition. Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950, 67 of which terminated, the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy. This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes (democratic status, nuclear weapons possession, capability imbalance, common enemies, and international systemic changes), as well as many other possible confounding variables. This research questions existing theories claiming that economic downturns are associated with diversionary war, and instead argues that in certain circumstances peace may result from economic troubles. I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely. Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely. In other words, rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically. This definition draws on a growing quantitative literature most closely associated with the research programs of William Thompson, J. Joseph Hewitt, and James P. Klein, Gary Goertz, and Paul F. Diehl.1 My definition conforms to that of William Thompson. In work with Karen Rasler, they define rivalries as situations in which “[b]oth actors view each other as a significant politicalmilitary threat and, therefore, an enemy.”2 In other work, Thompson writing with Michael Colaresi, explains further: The presumption is that decisionmakers explicitly identify who they think are their foreign enemies. They orient their military preparations and foreign policies toward meeting their threats. They assure their constituents that they will not let their adversaries take advantage. Usually, these activities are done in public. Hence, we should be able to follow the explicit cues in decisionmaker utterances and writings, as well as in the descriptive political histories written about the foreign policies of specific countries.3 Drawing from available records and histories, Thompson and David Dreyer have generated a universe of strategic rivalries from 1494 to 2010 that serves as the basis for this project’s empirical analysis.4 This project measures rivalry termination as occurring on the last year that Thompson and Dreyer record the existence of a rivalry.

Such aid is more attractive during periods of economic turmoil than during periods of comparative normalcy. In South Asia, India and Pakistan struggled from 1947 to 1960 with how to manage water resources in the Indus Rivers basin, inheriting a canal system meant to service pre-partitioned India. Pakistan, suffering an economic downturn, and India, reliant on foreign aid to avert economic crisis, agreed to an Indus Waters Treaty in 1960 to resolve the lingering dispute, made possible in substantial part because of World Bank financing that was especially attractive to the struggling economies. In the Middle East, Egypt and Israel made the hard choices necessary for the Camp David accord in 1979 precisely because the Sadat and Begin governments faced difficult economic situations at home that made the U.S. aid guarantee in exchange for a peace agreement especially attractive.21 In 1982, the Yemen’s People’s Republic agreed to stop its attempts to destabilize Oman, because otherwise Yemen would not receive economic assistance from Arab oil producing states that it desperately needed.22 In the late 1990s, El Niño-induced flooding devastated Ecuador and Peru, spurring reconciliation as leaders sought to increase trade, secure investment, and slash military expenditures so they could be used at home.23 As one Western diplomat assessed at the time, Ecuador and Peru “have decided it's better to see reason…. They see foreign companies eager to invest in South America, and if Peru and Ecuador are in conflict, it makes them less attractive than, say, Argentina or Brazil or Chile for investment purposes. That's the last thing either country wants.”24 Economic Downturns Can Cause Meaningful Leadership Change The above mechanisms have identified how economic difficulties can alter the preferences of an incumbent leader. Additionally, economic crises can lead to leadership turnover and, during periods of difficulty, the selection process that determines new leadership can loosen ideological strictures that relate to extant rivalries. Leaders may be selected based on judgments about their ability to cope with economic problems, with greater elite acceptance of ideological heterogeneity in foreign policy beliefs than in periods of normalcy.25 In Stephen Brooks and William Wohlforth’s words, “If everything is going well or is stable, then why select leaders who might subvert the triedand-true identity? But if that identity is leading to increased material difficulties, pressure for change will likely mount. In these circumstances, those who are willing to alter or adjust the hallowed precepts of the existing identity and its associated practices are more likely to assume power.”26 Economic crisis, then, can spur incumbent leaders to either abandon the “baggage” of rivalry or facilitate the selection of new leaders that do not carry such baggage. The most well-known example of an incumbent selectorate looking for a reformer, even one without much foreign policy experience, involves Mikhail Gorbachev’s ascension to the Soviet premiership. In political scientist Jerry Hough’s words, “If the rate of economic growth continued to decline, if administrative and labor efficiency continued to fall, if corruption was not punished, these conditions would have dangerous consequences for the [Soviet Union in the] 1980s and 1990s…. Gorbachev’s promotion was an answer to these concerns.”27",summarize the following text: ,"Do economic downturns generate pressure for diversionary conflict This paper provides new evidence that economic stress is associated with conciliatory policies between strategic rivals For states that view each other as military threats, the biggest step possible toward bilateral cooperation is to terminate the rivalry by taking political steps to manage the competition Drawing on data from 109 distinct rival dyads since 1950 67 of which terminated the evidence suggests rivalries were approximately twice as likely to terminate during economic downturns than they were during periods of economic normalcy This is true controlling for all of the main alternative explanations for peaceful relations between foes democratic status nuclear weapons capability imbalance common enemies  international systemic changes I define a rivalry as the perception by national elites of two states that the other state possesses conflicting interests and presents a military threat of sufficient severity that future military conflict is likely Rivalry termination is the transition from a state of rivalry to one where conflicts of interest are not viewed as being so severe as to provoke interstate conflict and/or where a mutual recognition of the imbalance in military capabilities makes conflict-causing bargaining failures unlikely rivalries terminate when the elites assess that the risks of military conflict between rivals has been reduced dramatically Economic crises lead to conciliatory behavior through five primary channels Collectively, these mechanisms make it much more likely that a leader will prefer conciliatory policies compared to during periods of economic normalcy Economic Crisis Leads to Austerity Government revenues are a function of national economic production, so that when production diminishes through recession, revenues available for expenditure also diminish Planning almost invariably assumes growth rather than contraction, so the deviation in available revenues compared to the planned expenditure can be sizable This is especially the case when this borrowing relies on international sources of credit intellectual attachment to balanced budgets as a means to restore confidence generates incentives to curtail expenditure These incentives to cut occur precisely when populations are experiencing economic hardship, making reductions especially painful that target welfare The politics of welfare state retrenchment is typically treacherous, because it imposes tangible losses on concentrated groups of voters this can spur policymakers to curtail national security spending as a way to balance budgets during periods of economic turmoil There is often more discretion over defense spending than over other areas in the budget and it is frequently distantly connected to the welfare of the mass public Pursuing defense cuts may also conform to the preferences of the financial sector, which shows a strong aversion to military conflict Economic contraction heightens the opportunity costs by forcing a choice between different types of spending There is a constituency for defense spending but even in militarized economies this constituency tends to be numerically much smaller than those that favor social and economic expenditures over military ones. First the cutbacks themselves serve as a concrete signal to adversaries that the military threat posed by the economically distressed state is declining. This permits the other state to halt that portion of defense spending dedicated to keeping up, breaking the back of ongoing arms races Unilateral conventional force reductions were a major element of Gorbachev’s foreign policy in the late 1980s Gorbachev similarly used force reductions in Afghanistan, Mongolia, and the Soviet Far East to signal to China in 1987 that he was serious about political

to his strategic views, but necessitated by a difficult budgetary environment unilateral defense cuts and force reductions are frequently combined with negotiated political agreements in a sequential, iterative fashion, where a unilateral reduction will signal seriousness that opens the way for political agreement which in turn permits even deeper reductions Thus the “main reason” why strategic

"------------------- last paragraph of their card ---------------------
As such, the starting point of decolonization is not a rejection of colonialism. Rather than
replace the dominant with the marginalized, or as Fanon (1968) puts it, make it so “the last shall
be first and the first last” (p. 37), the decolonizing project seeks to reimagine and rearticulate
power, change, and knowledge through a multiplicity of epistimologies, ontologies and
axiologies. Decolonization cannot take place without contestation. It must necessarily push back
against the colonial relations of power that threaten Indigenous ways of being. Alfred (2009b)
and others have suggested that decolonization can only be “achieved through the resurgence of
an Indigenous consciousness channeled into contention with colonialism” (p. 48; emphasis added). Indigenous knowledges are the starting point for resurgence and decolonization, are the
medium through which we engage in the present, and are the possibility of an Indigenous future.
Without this power base, decolonization becomes a domesticated industry of ideas.
Decolonization is not always about the co-existence of knowledges, nor knowledge synthesis,
which inevitably centers colonial logic. Whiteness does not ‘play well with others’ but, rather,
fragments and marginalizes - so it must be asked: Co-existence at what cost and for whose
benefit? Decolonization necessarily unsettles. In the face of the beast of colonialism, thirsty for
the blood of Indigeneity and drunk on conquest, assimilation is submission and decolonization
calls on those who will “beat the beast into submission and teach it to behave” (Alfred, 2009a, p.
37).
------------------- next paragraph starts here ---------------------
Alongside the question of how we engage colonial geographies is the question of how we engage colonial institutions. We are cognizant that we write from the (relatively) privileged position of the Western academy, an institution born from – and premised on – knowledge theft, muzzling, and selective storytelling. It is an institution that helped draw up the first blueprints of colonization, both here and abroad. Reyes Cruz (this issue) begins to ask: Can we in fact decolonize the Western Academy and its global appendages? Further, what are the costs of our membership in these institutions? What are we forced to give up and what is taken from us? Lastly, what are the possibilities and limitations of using the “master’s tools” to destroy and rebuild his house? Scholars who write about “decolonizing the Academy” have tackled these questions in greater depth (Mihesuah & Waziyatawin, 2004; Dei, 2000). In the larger scope of the discussion: Is it possible to decolonize institutions of colonial power (such as the academy, government, etc.), but, further, is it possible to decolonize through them? In the context of Africa, Thesee and Carr (this issue) explore the potential of Indigenous peoples achieving “mainstream visibility” – and a seat at the table of global social-economics – through international frameworks of recognition, particularly through the UN’s International Year for People of African Descent (IYPAD) in 2011. They highlight both IYPAD’s successes as well as glaring failures, arguing that the IYPAD ultimately functioned to continue African invisibility despite its promises of greater visibility on the world stage. They settle on the idea that, through a sort of anti-colonial advocacy, institutions like the UN can be forced into accountable, transparent and more symmetrical relationships of recognition. On the other side of this debate are those who call into question the productivity and possibility of looking to colonial structures for pathways to decolonization. Glen Coulthard (2007) believes that when we seek to be made visible through the acceptance of colonial institutions, we reinscribe the colonial as arbiter and validator, and recognize its authority to regulate and dictate Indigenous life (Coulthard, 2007). Through the example of resurging Indigenous governance on Turtle Island, T’hohahoken (2005) echoes Coulthard’s critique of “institutional power”, noting, “colonized people are self-governed. Free people are self-determined” (p. 157). When we read Thesee and Carr in conversation with Coulthard and T’hohahoken, we are forced to consider important questions: Does Indigenous peoples’ presence inside the halls of power indicate power? Can we decolonize through more equitable recognition from colonial institutions? These questions come down to the difference between the politics of recognition and revolution, being made visible or changing the criteria by which we “see” the world. Within the academy and within other institutions, these are the questions we must reckon with on the path to decolonization. In recognizing our location, both academically and geographically, we must re-emphasize the primacy of land and materiality in the decolonization struggle. As Tuck and Yang (this issue) remind us, too often decolonization becomes reduced to efforts to ‘decolonize the mind’ - those of us in the academy are often particularly guilty of this – and fails to recognize the very real, very physical effects that colonization has on peoples. This reminder is not a new one; Amilcar Cabral (1966) reminded us forty years ago that there is danger in seeing decolonization as strictly the liberation of the mind. He cautioned colonized peoples to remember that, much of the time, “people are not fighting for ideas, for the things in anyone’s head. They are fighting for material benefits, to live better and in peace, to see their lives go forward, to guarantee the future for their children” (quoted in Idahosa, 2002, p. 1). For many colonized peoples, especially those living under the ongoing violence inflicted by settler-colonial nation states, decolonization is defined by the urgency of land struggle and by the restoration of traditional territories now separated by state borders. Colonization is devastating and decolonization necessarily goes beyond mental gymnastics and Western conceptions of ‘Reason’. Decolonization is an emotional process; not in the simplistic way ascribed to non-white peoples by White supremacy (Fanon, 1967), but in a way that goes beyond, goes deeper, goes further than reason can reach. The mental, spiritual and emotional toll that colonization still exacts is neither fictive nor less important than the material; but without grounding land, water, and air as central, decolonization is a shell game. We cannot decolonize without recognizing the primacy of land and Indigenous sovereignty over that land. Lawrence and Dua (2005) poignantly remind us of this when they state: “To speak of Indigenous nationhood is to speak of land as Indigenous, in ways that are neither rhetorical nor metaphorical” (p. 124). What often gets twisted in this conception, and where possibility of failure lies, is when we fail to recognize that land, spirit, and mind are inherently connected – creating sharp separations has been an important part of the colonial project. Indigenous connections to the land are spiritual. Relationship to the land, and not in a romanticized or fetishized ‘noble savage’ sort of way, generates the knowledge (and theory) that is required for survival. The spiritual is not absent from theory or day-to-day decisions. Each of these (mental, spiritual, material) are wrapped up, entangled, and enmeshed in one another. Decolonization demands the valuing of Indigenous sovereignty in its material, psychological, epistemological, and spiritual forms. As noted previously, despite our insistence on the local as vital to Indigeneity and our undertaking of decolonization, we are also curious about exploring the possibility of a collective, global Indigenous movement. What does it mean to understand that “Imperialism frames the Indigenous experience. It is part of our story” (Smith, 2012, p. 20)? The Indigenous is not merely an opposite of the colonial (as Martin Nakata reminds us in this issue), but Indigeneity and colonialism are indeed oppositional. How do we work with the oppositional in a way that takes direction from the full reclamation of Indigenous histories, present conditions, and visions for the future? While, obviously, there are vast differences in how Indigeneity is lived, as well as how it responds to colonial intrusion, how can we understand similarities in experiences, in epistemologies, and in resisting continued colonial intrusion? Tuck and Wang (in this issue) begin exploring the incommensurability of decolonization with other movements around the world, but where do differences end and similarities begin? This is not a search for a pan- Indigenous identity but for relationships and alliances that can strengthen local decolonization movements. Who is Indigenous? As mentioned earlier, often the decolonizing project has had to, out of necessity, focus on reclaiming or restating the humanity of colonized peoples. Colonization has been determined to stand as the final arbiter of who is human. Integral to this process is the delegitimization of Indigenous humanity and life. In the process of reasserting Indigenous humanity, too often the rubric has remained a Western styled humanism that proclaims, ‘We are all Indigenous’, conflating Indigeneity with humanity. This approach is similarly deployed at times by the non- African world, which articulates an ‘Africa as the cradle of humanity’ stance to conclude that ‘we are all African’. We firmly reject this stance. Colonialism and its concomitant project of white supremacy have always seen and understood Indigeneity as different and threatening, working overtime to marginalize and erase Indigenous existence. A claim to a shared humanity is not decolonizing and works to reinscribe a racist framework of ‘color-blindness’. Such a claim necessarily falls back on religious (and subsequently secular) language of solidarity that believes the Sunday school notions of ‘we are equal under God’ (Gaztambide-Fernández, this issue), and erases and minimizes the power differentials that colonialism created and continues to maintain. As Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2012) argues, “The focus on asserting humanity has to be seen within the anti-colonial analysis of imperialism and what are seen as imperialism’s dehumanizing imperatives” (p. 27). We also push back against the project of deciding who is Indigenous through colonial strategies of measurement and containment, of finding particular genetic, historic and communal markers by which to legitimize who can and cannot be Indigenous. This is particularly done through a policing of boundaries, especially under a binary system of Indigenous/non- Indigenous, which has a long history of colonial power taking up these tools of differentiation to divide and conquer, disenfranchise, and steal land from Indigenous peoples. What these delineations of Indigeneity look like differ depending on context and place but the intent and logic behind them is similar. In Africa, where Indigeneity and Indigenous governance existed before colonial rule, its formalization took place through legally inscribed identities of “native” and “non-native”. Indigeneity came to be defined along the lines of race and ethnicity. “The distinction between race and ethnicities was not the same as the distinction between colonizers and colonized” (p. 656), the hierarchy of races included both colonizers (from the master race) and the colonized (from subject races). Mamdani (2001) suggests that it is worth grasping the difference between subject races and subject ethnicities. While both were colonized, the subject ethnicities were considered Indigenous and the subject races were considered non Indigenous, immigrants (ex: the Tutsi of Rwanda and Burundi). In the case of Rwanda, despite the social revolution that lead to independence, the imposed racial and ethnic categories of colonial rule stayed intact and intensified the economic and political tensions, which eventually slid towards the 1990 genocide. Mamdani (2001) argues that though “we turned the colonial world upside down, we didn't change it“ (p. 9). This understanding of ethnicity is not without its problems though. The use of ethnicity continues to sever, interrupt and re-name Indigenous identities. In Rwanda and Burundi, for example, the categories of Hutu and Tutsi did not exist prior to the eighteenth century, when colonial anthropologists divided local peoples by physical traits and lines of work. Some even going as far as measuring noses and cranium sizes to ‘discover’ biological differences that denoted a lesser humanity (Mamdani, 2002, p. 44). Little has changed since then. “Ethnicity” is often a residual of colonialism; it remains a measuring stick that exists as part of the state’s vocabulary to measure, contain and control colonized peoples, and it remains a dehistoricized stand-in for Indigeneity. Alfred (2009a) draws similarities between the concepts of Third World “ethnicity” and “Aboriginalism”, saying that both are part of “assimilation’s end-game, the terminological and psychic displacement of authentic Indigenous identities, beliefs and behaviors...Aboriginalism obscures everything that is historically true and meaningful about Onkwehonwe” (p. 126-127). In interrogating colonial markers of identity we must ask: How does Indigeneity get ‘captured’ and domesticated by colonial states, both here and abroad? How do state frameworks for recognition render some constitutionally Indigenous - and because of this, visible - while others are not? In Canada, as in other Western settler-colonial contexts, discourses of multiculturalism have tried to place Indigenous peoples within a community of ethnic groups. As Rubén Gaztambide-Fernández (this issue) rightly critiques multiculturalism, its project of ethnicity and culture is one of containment and empty signifiers, stripping culture of any power in order to fit it within a colonial paradigm. Even further, Indigenous peoples, who have occupied their lands since time immemorial become expelled by and then invited back into the settler nation-state as “Aboriginal”. This process unties the knots of history, loosens Indigenous claims to land, and reduces them to members of a multicultural minority, always located around the nation but never within it. Through settler constitutions such as Canada’s Indian Act, Indigeneity has been denied to many through gendered, racist policies that worked to make extinct Indigenous peoples, removing communities so that the land does indeed look ‘uninhabited’ and pristinely empty for settler occupation (Tuck & Yang, this issue; Smith, 2010; Razack, 2002). The project of articulating Indigeneity has too often taken up the tools of colonialism to police borders. Who decides that approximately 67.7 million people in India are Indigenous? How is it decided that the Maasai of Kenya are Indigenous but other communities who live in proximity to the Maasai are not? Should Indigeneity be self-proclaimed (in relationship with a particular community) as a strategy of resisting particular demarcations, or are the consequences of self-proclamation far too dangerous? Relatedly, how is it that some geographies are considered to house Indigenous knowledges but not Indigenous people? Few scholars - including ourselves - have noticed that Indigenous discussions happening across borders too often only include Turtle Island scholars in dialogue with the South Pacific. What is missing from these current discussions of Indigeneity and decolonization? How does Indigeneity in South America, Asia, and Africa factor in? This opens large questions to be answered, or perhaps to be unanswered: Can we articulate a diasporic Indigeneity? What effects do (in)voluntary movement, displacement, and globalized movement of knowledge have on local forms of Indigeneity, especially if we understand, as Dei, Hall & Rosenberg (2000) do, that Indigeneity is connected to occupation of particular land and places? Dei (in this issue) begins to explore the possibilities of Indigenous knowledge in diasporic education, but what changes when Indigenous knowledges from one place (in Dei’s case, Africa) are brought into other Indigenous contexts (Turtle Island/North America)? In an increasingly globalized world, how do various contestations and Indigeneities interact across diasporic spatialities? How does this contrast or work with what Leanne Simpson (2001) argues, that as Indigenous knowledges become assimilated they become of little use to Indigenous peoples trying to advance their interests? What are the balances between assimilation and/or integration and cooperation for decolonization? How can Indigenous peoples form strategic alliances that both contest continuing colonial action at all levels, while respecting difference and local contexts? Indigeneity is full of contestation and contradiction, both within itself and in relation to outside forces – to what should be no one’s surprise. But, as Linda Smith (2012) succinctly notes, often only Western cultures are allowed to be diverse and contradictory, while Indigeneity it expected to be ‘pure’, of one mind and aesthetic, and easily identifiable. As Nakata (this issue) notes, there are intricacies and complexities that have been underexplored; we hope that this journal becomes a space where these questions can be engaged in respectful and empowering ways One of the greatest challenges in looking to understand decolonization in complex ways is bridging the divide of action vs. theory. Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang (this issue) remind us that “settler colonialism and its decolonization implicates and unsettles everyone” (p. 7). They go on to explore how there is no room for settlers to claim innocence in the ongoing colonial violence and dispossession of Indigenous land. Importantly, however, we each also have the agency to participate in this violence (or resist it) through morally differentiated positions, levels of complicity, points of impact, and consequence. For this reason, what knowledge we choose to produce has everything to do with who we are and how we choose to act in the world. Transformative praxis can be measured by our ability to show scholarly courage and imagination in taking our ideas off the bookshelf and acting on them. Decolonization does not simply suggest that we refrain from becoming spectators to the knowledge we produce; it demands it. As Fanon (1967) clearly laid out, “It’s no longer a question of knowing the world, but of transforming it” (p. 1). It is this transformative action that Waziyatawin (in this issue) displays great imagination in outlining in the “endgame of empire,” asking what kind of world Indigenous resurgence hopes to bring about after it is gone. She encourages her readers to peek behind the colonial curtain to see that a central “facet of the colonial picture is an illusion of permanency and inevitability” (p. 76). Importantly, she also encourages her readers to recognize that there is life beyond colonialism; that a certain degree of hope, in both theory and practice, is necessary in defeating it. Colonialism may actively work to shape the world but it can also be made malleable, forced to show the cracks in its walls, and forced to retreat through struggle against it. As we witness the death throes of global capitalism and its insatiable appetite for Indigenous land and resources, we must also understand that, like a cornered animal, it will fight until the last breath in defending the privileges of colonial governments and extractive industry. According to Waziyatawin, this is the paradox of Indigenous resurgence at the end of empire: “while we have an opportunity to realize its emancipatory potential, if we do not succeed soon, the chances for the survival of all life will severely diminish” (p. 82). For this reason both decolonization theory and action are time sensitive.",summarize the following text: ,"Alongside is the question of how we engage colonial institutions. what are the possibilities of using the “master’s tools” to destroy and rebuild ? Is it possible to decolonize institutions of colonial government, is it possible to decolonize through them? through anti-colonial advocacy, institutions can be forced into accountable and more symmetrical relationships of recognition One great challenge in decolonization is bridging the divide of action vs. theory. Transformative praxis can be measured by taking our ideas off the bookshelf and acting on them Decolonization does not simply question knowing the world, but of transforming it” there is life beyond colonialism a certain degree of hope is necessary in defeating it.

"‘Everything that invokes Nature invokes the domination of Nature.’ Jean Baudrillard, The Mirror of Production (56). This paper argues that the current division within the scientific and popular debate into ‘for’ or ‘against’ the truth or reality of anthropogenic climate change silences more comprehensive analyses of the problems facing humanity today. It suggests that climate change activism, as well as the scientific evidence for anthropogenic climate change, in their opposition to climate change denialism, are the paroxysmal outgrowths of what the paper identifies as the techno-capitalist acceleration of the humanist aporia. The paper also argues that as an outflow of the humanist fantasy of the mastery of nature through technological and economic production, climate science and activism are in many ways the hypermodern or simulated enactments of earlier 1990s environmentalist activism. This is due to the fact that this enactment runs through the ambiguous reproduction and recuperation of an idealized ‘nature,’ which conceptualization itself is already a product of the capitalist-humanist social order. The division between the truth and falsehood of anthropogenic climate change is then a false opposition in that it remains complicit in the humanist and productivist techno-scientific ordering of the world in which the human is supposedly the central actor or producer. What is more, the incessant jumbling over one another of this debate in the media is a simulation of climate politics insofar this debate itself becomes an ingredient for economic acceleration. This also means that this paper and its delivery constitute an instant of this economy’s deconstruction in climate change science and activism, because this paper is compelled to take the side of the veracity of climate change so as to point to the limits of this productivist-humanist economy, while simultaneously being fully implicated in this economy. Since the current activism and debate on the environment fails to deepen its critique sufficiently in light of the exponentially raised stakes under economic techno-acceleration, a more radical critique of the climate conundrum must also generate an alternative reading of climate change as a quintessentially politicotechnological apparition. Note though that calling climate change an ‘apparition’ does not imply that the occurrence of climate change is simply false. Rather, I suggest that the accusations hurled at those who are even modestly sceptical of climate change by immediately branding such sceptics as immoral right-wing capitalists, are missing a central point: namely that many such sceptics are fellow travellers in the larger critique of modern science and technology that climate activists just as much seek to mount. Since at issue is then the truth of science and its method of empiricist validation through modern technologies, a more radical analysis should reconsider the very division between reality and representation, if only because technological acceleration has made the representation of science (in the media, for instance) into the dominant reality. This complication of the division between reality and representation hence suggests that if climate change exists, then climate change is actually a simulation that dissimulates or obscures another more urgent catastrophe or problem. This in turn might mean that popular climate change activism and thought is implicated in its mobilization for the productivist neoliberal order due to the present-day enmeshment of simulation and acceleration by way of modern technologies. Paradoxically then, this paper must start from the premise that the occurrence of anthropogenic climate change is true, as this would be the responsible and productive position; but it also acknowledges that responsibilities are always constituted in historical and socio-economical imperatives like the humanistic and economistic ones. To overlay the duty of humanism to critique its own duty with the way responsible climate science and activism finds its limitations in the truth-value of the scientific and activist climate change model is then crucial in terms of understanding how a truly radical alternative may emerge from the ambiguous ethics of accelerated humanism. This paper’s performance of this moral imperative hence points to the sheer force of neoliberal globalization; or, one could say that the humanist argument in climate activism that criticizes the inherent limitations of accelerated capitalistic expansion’s non-sustainability directly constitutes this paper’s fundamental ‘ecological’ limitation and argumentative logic. This paper will then mobilize this aporia of contemporary climate activism, which we find accelerated today into the simulation of its veracity, by analysing some exemplary debates around the preservation of ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ in traditional environmentalism. Environmentalism, which took off in terms of a wider scientific and public concern with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, provides a good starting point in order to discern which paradoxical tropes and calls for action inform ‘green’ political engagement in general. In its incessant compulsion to cover over its own internal contradictions namely, environmentalism has mutated into climate change activism due to the latter’s heavy indebtedness to scientific and technological attempts at modelling ‘reality’ and making predictions. This analysis agrees with Ulrich Beck’s thesis on risk society in World at Risk, although it does not see the cosmopolitan impetus that arises from risk’s global spread as necessarily positive in terms of political mobilisation. The problem is namely that climate change as a techno-political apparition which is ‘more real than reality itself’ emerges out of the ambiguous representation of ‘nature’ that marked environmentalism, and is as such implicated in the acceleration and magnification of risk through its global political mobilisation. It is in turn out of this ambiguous status of ‘nature’ that the utter force of technological reproduction and acceleration brings about the in-discernability of reality and representation. Under the new conditions of acceleration then, the artificial split between image and truth that has made possible modern science and philosophy since the onset of humanism finally implodes onto itself. Analyses of the relationship between environmentalism and the media should therefore likewise go beyond common descriptions in the social sciences of how the media influence popular opinion around climate change, although such analyses are certainly not without merit. Rather, these analyses should also consider how the illusion of the neutral or transparent communication and representation of ‘nature’ in early environmentalist texts allows for the possibility of climate science’s truth-claims about ‘nature,’ even if such technological acceleration engenders increasing doubt and confusion regarding the truth of climate change and its causes, as well as to the appropriate moral response. In order to elucidate the exemplary status of environmentalist critiques and affirmations of nature in terms of my argument on climate science and activism, I will at this juncture briefly touch on what I see as Jean Baudrillard’s cardinal point throughout his oeuvre. Baudrillard argues in The Mirror of Production as well as in much of his later work that signs become objects for consumption, and that political or conceptual opposition merely sustains the general exploitation of (false) differences for economic growth. What Baudrillard aims at is that the conceptual split of the sign in classical semiotics into signifier and signified constitutes not a universal truth about the generation of meaning, but marks a historically specific moment in a stage of capitalism which Baudrillard designates as ‘productivist.’ What this means is that the difference between nature and culture, or the opposition between the truth and denial of anthropogenic climate change, are themselves markers as well as ingredients of the neoliberal technocratic order. As Baudrillard aptly notes: ‘in the mirror of the economic, Nature looks at us with the eyes of necessity:’ both the ‘sham’ necessity of human production and of salvation (by and of nature) are essentially capitalist simulations (58). The concept of the signified emerges alongside the capitalist model of exchange value as a supposed derivative of use value, but use value in the form of so-called ‘real’ desires, just like the signified or the referent, is simply conjured up as an ‘alibi,’ says Baudrillard in ‘For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign’ (78), for a capitalism that justifies itself by relying on the assumption that those desires for an ‘unspoiled nature’ are indeed ‘natural.’ Humanism therefore once more appears in activisms that seek the salvation of ‘nature’ as the grounding ideology of accelerated capitalism by virtue of the unquestionable status of the productive human as the agent ‘extracting’ value from ‘nature.’ But this anthropocentrism at the heart of capitalism is exactly also the problem of anthropogenic environmental pollution. It is for this reason that Baudrillard exclaims in The Mirror of Production that ‘the entire rationality of the system of political economy … gravitates … around the concept of Nature’ (53). We can see this ambiguity around ‘nature’ clearly in the paradoxes of even those environmentalist texts that feel rightly uncomfortable with a straightforward affirmation of ‘nature.’ All of them, like also this paper, seem compelled by that sheer force of neoliberal acceleration to reproduce the ideal of the humanist-activist subject even if that very subject is also designated as the problem underlying ecological disaster. One of the key texts that began to critique ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ as a construction is William Cronon’s ‘The Trouble with Wilderness.’ Cronon argues rather convincingly that the romantic call for the preservation of ‘wilderness’ is rife with racism and sexism. This racism and sexism shows itself in the highly prevalent idea in environmentalism of nature as ‘feminine’ and ‘primitive,’ thus showing that the notion of nature ‘serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi-religious values of environmentalism rest’ (14, 10). Modern environmentalism then exhibits for Cronon a form of anthropocentric arrogance because it assumes that humanity has the power to destroy as well as rescue wilderness. Nonetheless, Cronon suggests at the end of his piece that the idea of the ‘wild’ and of ‘nature’ has some merit since it also exactly signifies that which is beyond human control, and he uses this potential of them being ‘outside’ in order to reinstate the environmentalist endeavour (19). I argue that it is the indeterminability of whether the ‘wild’ or ‘nature’ is inside or outside culture that allows Cronon to make an appeal to a ‘real’ wilderness which in turn salvages the scientific and humanist quest of our or its emancipation. But this split between complicit and real wilderness in Cronon’s piece is eventually a false distinction, which difference becomes implicated in accelerated technological reproduction by remobilising the human political agent and his capitalist relation to ‘nature.’ It is by virtue of the ambiguity of the status of the term that Cronon can enact the humanist ‘trick’ of giving environmentalism its politics back, thereby remaining faithful to the activist duty and its complicities in the productivist order. The moral impetus that informs Cronon’s critique allows for a political re-enablement that dissimulates the humanist aporia and its complicity in a non-sustainable economy. Perhaps a mere constructionist critique of environmentalism does not go far enough to unsettle the general logic of humanist-productivism as such activism as well as its critique run [speed] headlong into their own ecological and linguistic limits. Other texts by early prominent environmental scholars, like Kate Soper’s fittingly titled ‘Nature/“nature”,’ and Kevin DeLuca’s ‘A Wilderness Environmentalism Manifesto,’ enact the same curious logic, albeit in different ways. DeLuca’s text is particularly interesting because it displays the aporetic madness [absurdity] that underlies the environmentalist project – and I certainly do not mean to say that this madness [absurdity] makes this project illegitimate. Rather, this madness [absurdity] marks the constant and accelerated shuttling between ecological hope and despair under the intensified politics of humanism. Referencing the Greek philosopher Protagoras, DeLuca claims that environmentalism should be done as a ‘wilderness environmentalism, wherein wilderness is the measure of all things,’ rather than humans as the measure of all things (40). But since ‘wilderness,’ as I outlined earlier, is a product of a productivist ‘culture,’ there is in the final analysis no ground for an ethics based on ‘bare nature.’ This means that DeLuca can only make a moral argument by virtue of the humanist-centred ethics that inspired also the environmentalism that he seeks to critique. His earlier points about preserving forests no matter the human interests in them – like the interests of forest-dwelling tribes – indeed appear as immoral or irresponsible towards such people. DeLuca therefore is forced to makes a case that environmentalism is (and should be) beneficial to humanity at large, and he does this by arguing that ‘caring for wilderness is caring for people’ (43). The enactment of his humanist responsibility therefore makes him go full circle to where he started, away from the ‘mad’ [absurd] yet logical claim that the priority should no longer be caring for people. DeLuca’s narrative mirrors the deconstruction that inhabits the paroxysm typical of the accelerated global order. His re-enunciation of the humanist trope makes this circular logic consistent with an increasingly global conception of humanity due to its universalizing gesture, while this global sphere being increasingly unstable. It is out of the accelerated simulation of this tension that I suggest recent climate change activism emerges. Finally, Kate Soper’s article on the distinction between the ‘mere’ construction and representation of nature, and the ‘real’ nature that environmentalism requires in order to justify its activism, is exemplary in terms of how its argument relates to the formal enunciation and to the mode of production of that argument. The way in which the solution is the problem – namely how the anthropocentric argument that ground the salvation or romanticization of ‘nature’ is itself the anthropogenic problem of climate change – shows up in Soper’s text in the way it ultimately keeps the spirit of environmentalism going. The point at which Soper discerns between ‘nature’ as an image ‘tainted’ by anthropocentric politics and ‘adequately’ represented nature (30) worth fighting for marks exactly the point at which this opposition enters the realm of capital circulation. This entrance into circulation happens by virtue of the energy-consuming typesetting, printing, and dissemination of the book in which her chapter sits, but also by virtue of the assumption of a distinction between representations closer to and further away from the ‘reality’ that informs her argument. I suggest that her desire for finding a language closer to ‘real nature’ – one that revives the environmentalist duty – is borne out of the demand for an ‘alibi’ for humanist activism. Or rather, the analysis of ‘nature’ as social construction demands a politics around ‘real nature’ to be mounted in order to cover over the abyss left by acceleration. This slippage of ‘nature’ between sign and object in her piece results in a curious sensation of activist vertigo; ‘nature’ becomes indeed that sign at which the anthropocentric logic of humanism starts to crumble. Soper’s piece hence unwittingly demonstrates the aporia of humanism – its auto-immunity or deconstruction – by showing that the postmodern critique of the term ‘nature’ in environmentalism follows from an ecological demand regarding its limitations. I am also calling the sensation one gets by reading Soper’s piece a feeling of ‘activist vertigo’ because it feels like a terrified suspension of the self-evidence of environmentalism, as if one – to use a metaphor from nature – stares down an enormous overhang into a ravine. This terror is perhaps the draw towards emptiness or death which activists and academics find inappropriate feelings under the neoliberal demand for human productivity. The fear of ‘not doing’ hence generates a stronger fear for death in late-capitalist cultures, even if dying itself is increasingly relegated to specialist settings, and even if it was perhaps initially the fear of death that gave rise to the humanist discourses of emancipation and (Christian) salvation. ‘Nature’ becomes in this outlook the ultimate object for technological mastery, but equally the ultimate source of revenge and destruction as it channels such mastery back to the human subject, who then becomes its target – or so it appears to us. What really happens is a pervasive re-distribution of death and dying at the hands of the neoliberal machine, in which the elites emerge as the winners in terms of what one calls ‘life-expectancy’ – a fittingly statisticist and managerial expression of which the linguistic ambiguity of ‘nature’ only is symptomatic. The ambiguous appearance and circularity of lethality indeed return in contemporary climate activism, in which for instance the obsession with carbon emissions gets precedence over rescuing peoples threatened by rising sea levels. The acceleration of the humanist aporia returns in environmentalism as the misconception of nature and wilderness as outside of social institutions, as well as a call to ‘go back to nature.’ This exaltation of ‘nature’ leads quite logically to the simulation of pristine ‘wild’ peoples as a new object of a globalizing nostalgia – a desire to become native or go back to nature. The emergence in the media of and nostalgic longing for unspoiled nature, as the illusion of stable origin and identity, is hence complicit in the productivist order. In many ways, the climate change model reworks certain Christian traits present in humanism, as an updated narrative of ‘our fall from paradise’ engenders a sense of guilt and self-flagellation, which under conditions of acceleration forces an arrogant techno-optimism that spurs ecological activity and represses despair. Simultaneously, the fact that environmentalism claims that assaults on nature are an assault on humanity also complicates the distinction between the social (the human) and the natural. This makes possible my argument that terms like ‘wilderness’ and ‘nature’ somehow gesture towards deconstruction by virtue of the un-decidability of their status either inside or outside the social, or of either true or false. This renders unstable the distinction between subject-agent and object-in-nature, as ‘humanity’ becomes both source and target of action and thought while the natural object seems to take its revenge. The ‘truth’ of climate change and its activism appeal to our basic experience as citizen-consumers under the era of technological and economic acceleration as well as co-construct that experience as a global one, as Beck also suggests. But it also shows that attempts to model or act on nature’s or the globe’s destruction obscures once more the moment at which the humanist-productivist order actually shows itself to be illegitimate.

"‘Everything that invokes Nature invokes the domination of Nature.’ Jean Baudrillard, The Mirror of Production (56). This paper argues that the current division within the scientific and popular debate into ‘for’ or ‘against’ the truth or reality of anthropogenic climate change silences more comprehensive analyses of the problems facing humanity today. It suggests that climate change activism, as well as the scientific evidence for anthropogenic climate change, in their opposition to climate change denialism, are the paroxysmal outgrowths of what the paper identifies as the techno-capitalist acceleration of the humanist aporia. The paper also argues that as an outflow of the humanist fantasy of the mastery of nature through technological and economic production, climate science and activism are in many ways the hypermodern or simulated enactments of earlier 1990s environmentalist activism. This is due to the fact that this enactment runs through the ambiguous reproduction and recuperation of an idealized ‘nature,’ which conceptualization itself is already a product of the capitalist-humanist social order. The division between the truth and falsehood of anthropogenic climate change is then a false opposition in that it remains complicit in the humanist and productivist techno-scientific ordering of the world in which the human is supposedly the central actor or producer. What is more, the incessant jumbling over one another of this debate in the media is a simulation of climate politics insofar this debate itself becomes an ingredient for economic acceleration. This also means that this paper and its delivery constitute an instant of this economy’s deconstruction in climate change science and activism, because this paper is compelled to take the side of the veracity of climate change so as to point to the limits of this productivist-humanist economy, while simultaneously being fully implicated in this economy. Since the current activism and debate on the environment fails to deepen its critique sufficiently in light of the exponentially raised stakes under economic techno-acceleration, a more radical critique of the climate conundrum must also generate an alternative reading of climate change as a quintessentially politicotechnological apparition. Note though that calling climate change an ‘apparition’ does not imply that the occurrence of climate change is simply false. Rather, I suggest that the accusations hurled at those who are even modestly sceptical of climate change by immediately branding such sceptics as immoral right-wing capitalists, are missing a central point: namely that many such sceptics are fellow travellers in the larger critique of modern science and technology that climate activists just as much seek to mount. Since at issue is then the truth of science and its method of empiricist validation through modern technologies, a more radical analysis should reconsider the very division between reality and representation, if only because technological acceleration has made the representation of science (in the media, for instance) into the dominant reality. This complication of the division between reality and representation hence suggests that if climate change exists, then climate change is actually a simulation that dissimulates or obscures another more urgent catastrophe or problem. This in turn might mean that popular climate change activism and thought is implicated in its mobilization for the productivist neoliberal order due to the present-day enmeshment of simulation and acceleration by way of modern technologies. Paradoxically then, this paper must start from the premise that the occurrence of anthropogenic climate change is true, as this would be the responsible and productive position; but it also acknowledges that responsibilities are always constituted in historical and socio-economical imperatives like the humanistic and economistic ones. To overlay the duty of humanism to critique its own duty with the way responsible climate science and activism finds its limitations in the truth-value of the scientific and activist climate change model is then crucial in terms of understanding how a truly radical alternative may emerge from the ambiguous ethics of accelerated humanism. This paper’s performance of this moral imperative hence points to the sheer force of neoliberal globalization; or, one could say that the humanist argument in climate activism that criticizes the inherent limitations of accelerated capitalistic expansion’s non-sustainability directly constitutes this paper’s fundamental ‘ecological’ limitation and argumentative logic. This paper will then mobilize this aporia of contemporary climate activism, which we find accelerated today into the simulation of its veracity, by analysing some exemplary debates around the preservation of ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ in traditional environmentalism. Environmentalism, which took off in terms of a wider scientific and public concern with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, provides a good starting point in order to discern which paradoxical tropes and calls for action inform ‘green’ political engagement in general. In its incessant compulsion to cover over its own internal contradictions namely, environmentalism has mutated into climate change activism due to the latter’s heavy indebtedness to scientific and technological attempts at modelling ‘reality’ and making predictions. This analysis agrees with Ulrich Beck’s thesis on risk society in World at Risk, although it does not see the cosmopolitan impetus that arises from risk’s global spread as necessarily positive in terms of political mobilisation. The problem is namely that climate change as a techno-political apparition which is ‘more real than reality itself’ emerges out of the ambiguous representation of ‘nature’ that marked environmentalism, and is as such implicated in the acceleration and magnification of risk through its global political mobilisation. It is in turn out of this ambiguous status of ‘nature’ that the utter force of technological reproduction and acceleration brings about the in-discernability of reality and representation. Under the new conditions of acceleration then, the artificial split between image and truth that has made possible modern science and philosophy since the onset of humanism finally implodes onto itself. Analyses of the relationship between environmentalism and the media should therefore likewise go beyond common descriptions in the social sciences of how the media influence popular opinion around climate change, although such analyses are certainly not without merit. Rather, these analyses should also consider how the illusion of the neutral or transparent communication and representation of ‘nature’ in early environmentalist texts allows for the possibility of climate science’s truth-claims about ‘nature,’ even if such technological acceleration engenders increasing doubt and confusion regarding the truth of climate change and its causes, as well as to the appropriate moral response.

"‘Everything that invokes Nature invokes the domination of Nature.’
Jean Baudrillard, The Mirror of Production (56).
This paper argues that the current division within the scientific and popular debate into ‘for’ or ‘against’ the truth or reality of anthropogenic climate change silences more comprehensive analyses of the problems facing humanity today. It suggests that climate change activism, as well as the scientific evidence for anthropogenic climate change, in their opposition to climate change denialism, are the paroxysmal outgrowths of what the paper identifies as the techno-capitalist acceleration of the humanist aporia. The paper also argues that as an outflow of the humanist fantasy of the mastery of nature through technological and economic production, climate science and activism are in many ways the hypermodern or simulated enactments of earlier 1990s environmentalist activism. This is due to the fact that this enactment runs through the ambiguous reproduction and recuperation of an idealized ‘nature,’ which conceptualization itself is already a product of the capitalist-humanist social order. The division between the truth and falsehood of anthropogenic climate change is then a false opposition in that it remains complicit in the humanist and productivist techno-scientific ordering of the world in which the human is supposedly the central actor or producer. What is more, the incessant jumbling over one another of this debate in the media is a simulation of climate politics insofar this debate itself becomes an ingredient for economic acceleration. This also means that this paper and its delivery constitute an instant of this economy’s deconstruction in climate change science and activism, because this paper is compelled to take the side of the veracity of climate change so as to point to the limits of this productivist-humanist economy, while simultaneously being fully implicated in this economy.
Since the current activism and debate on the environment fails to deepen its critique sufficiently in light of the exponentially raised stakes under economic techno-acceleration, a more radical critique of the climate conundrum must also generate an alternative reading of climate change as a quintessentially politicotechnological apparition.
Note though that calling climate change an ‘apparition’ does not imply that the occurrence of climate change is simply false. Rather, I suggest that the accusations hurled at those who are even modestly sceptical of climate change by immediately branding such sceptics as immoral right-wing capitalists, are missing a central point: namely that many such sceptics are fellow travellers in the larger critique of modern science and technology that climate activists just as much seek to mount. Since at issue is then the truth of science and its method of empiricist validation through modern technologies, a more radical analysis should reconsider the very division between reality and representation, if only because technological acceleration has made the representation of science (in the media, for instance) into the dominant reality. This complication of the division between reality and representation hence suggests that if climate change exists, then climate change is actually a simulation that dissimulates or obscures another more urgent catastrophe or problem. This in turn might mean that popular climate change activism and thought is implicated in its mobilization for the productivist neoliberal order due to the present-day enmeshment of simulation and acceleration by way of modern technologies. Paradoxically then, this paper must start from the premise that the occurrence of anthropogenic climate change is true, as this would be the responsible and productive position; but it also acknowledges that responsibilities are always constituted in historical and socio-economical imperatives like the humanistic and economistic ones. To overlay the duty of humanism to critique its own duty with the way responsible climate science and activism finds its limitations in the truth-value of the scientific and activist climate change model is then crucial in terms of understanding how a truly radical alternative may emerge from the ambiguous ethics of accelerated humanism. This paper’s performance of this moral imperative hence points to the sheer force of neoliberal globalization; or, one could say that the humanist argument in climate activism that criticizes the inherent limitations of accelerated capitalistic expansion’s non-sustainability directly constitutes this paper’s fundamental ‘ecological’ limitation and argumentative logic.
This paper will then mobilize this aporia of contemporary climate activism, which we find accelerated today into the simulation of its veracity, by analysing some exemplary debates around the preservation of ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ in traditional environmentalism. Environmentalism, which took off in terms of a wider scientific and public concern with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, provides a good starting point in order to discern which paradoxical tropes and calls for action inform ‘green’ political engagement in general. In its incessant compulsion to cover over its own internal contradictions namely, environmentalism has mutated into climate change activism due to the latter’s heavy indebtedness to scientific and technological attempts at modelling ‘reality’ and making predictions. This analysis agrees with Ulrich Beck’s thesis on risk society in World at Risk, although it does not see the cosmopolitan impetus that arises from risk’s global spread as necessarily positive in terms of political mobilisation. The problem is namely that climate change as a techno-political apparition which is ‘more real than reality itself’ emerges out of the ambiguous representation of ‘nature’ that marked environmentalism, and is as such implicated in the acceleration and magnification of risk through its global political mobilisation. It is in turn out of this ambiguous status of ‘nature’ that the utter force of technological reproduction and acceleration brings about the in-discernability of reality and representation. Under the new conditions of acceleration then, the artificial split between image and truth that has made possible modern science and philosophy since the onset of humanism finally implodes onto itself. Analyses of the relationship between environmentalism and the media should therefore likewise go beyond common descriptions in the social sciences of how the media influence popular opinion around climate change, although such analyses are certainly not without merit. Rather, these analyses should also consider how the illusion of the neutral or transparent communication and representation of ‘nature’ in early environmentalist texts allows for the possibility of climate science’s truth-claims about ‘nature,’ even if such technological acceleration engenders increasing doubt and confusion regarding the truth of climate change and its causes, as well as to the appropriate moral response.
In order to elucidate the exemplary status of environmentalist critiques and affirmations of nature in terms of my argument on climate science and activism, I will at this juncture briefly touch on what I see as Jean Baudrillard’s cardinal point throughout his oeuvre. Baudrillard argues in The Mirror of Production as well as in much of his later work that signs become objects for consumption, and that political or conceptual opposition merely sustains the general exploitation of (false) differences for economic growth. What Baudrillard aims at is that the conceptual split of the sign in classical semiotics into signifier and signified constitutes not a universal truth about the generation of meaning, but marks a historically specific moment in a stage of capitalism which Baudrillard designates as ‘productivist.’ What this means is that the difference between nature and culture, or the opposition between the truth and denial of anthropogenic climate change, are themselves markers as well as ingredients of the neoliberal technocratic order. As Baudrillard aptly notes: ‘in the mirror of the economic, Nature looks at us with the eyes of necessity:’ both the ‘sham’ necessity of human production and of salvation (by and of nature) are essentially capitalist simulations (58). The concept of the signified emerges alongside the capitalist model of exchange value as a supposed derivative of use value, but use value in the form of so-called ‘real’ desires, just like the signified or the referent, is simply conjured up as an ‘alibi,’ says Baudrillard in ‘For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign’ (78), for a capitalism that justifies itself by relying on the assumption that those desires for an ‘unspoiled nature’ are indeed ‘natural.’ Humanism therefore once more appears in activisms that seek the salvation of ‘nature’ as the grounding ideology of accelerated capitalism by virtue of the unquestionable status of the productive human as the agent ‘extracting’ value from ‘nature.’ But this anthropocentrism at the heart of capitalism is exactly also the problem of anthropogenic environmental pollution. It is for this reason that Baudrillard exclaims in The Mirror of Production that ‘the entire rationality of the system of political economy … gravitates … around the concept of Nature’ (53). We can see this ambiguity around ‘nature’ clearly in the paradoxes of even those environmentalist texts that feel rightly uncomfortable with a straightforward affirmation of ‘nature.’ All of them, like also this paper, seem compelled by that sheer force of neoliberal acceleration to reproduce the ideal of the humanist-activist subject even if that very subject is also designated as the problem underlying ecological disaster.
One of the key texts that began to critique ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ as a construction is William Cronon’s ‘The Trouble with Wilderness.’ Cronon argues rather convincingly that the romantic call for the preservation of ‘wilderness’ is rife with racism and sexism. This racism and sexism shows itself in the highly prevalent idea in environmentalism of nature as ‘feminine’ and ‘primitive,’ thus showing that the notion of nature ‘serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi-religious values of environmentalism rest’ (14, 10). Modern environmentalism then exhibits for Cronon a form of anthropocentric arrogance because it assumes that humanity has the power to destroy as well as rescue wilderness. Nonetheless, Cronon suggests at the end of his piece that the idea of the ‘wild’ and of ‘nature’ has some merit since it also exactly signifies that which is beyond human control, and he uses this potential of them being ‘outside’ in order to reinstate the environmentalist endeavour (19). I argue that it is the indeterminability of whether the ‘wild’ or ‘nature’ is inside or outside culture that allows Cronon to make an appeal to a ‘real’ wilderness which in turn salvages the scientific and humanist quest of our or its emancipation. But this split between complicit and real wilderness in Cronon’s piece is eventually a false distinction, which difference becomes implicated in accelerated technological reproduction by remobilising the human political agent and his capitalist relation to ‘nature.’ It is by virtue of the ambiguity of the status of the term that Cronon can enact the humanist ‘trick’ of giving environmentalism its politics back, thereby remaining faithful to the activist duty and its complicities in the productivist order. The moral impetus that informs Cronon’s critique allows for a political re-enablement that dissimulates the humanist aporia and its complicity in a non-sustainable economy. Perhaps a mere constructionist critique of environmentalism does not go far enough to unsettle the general logic of humanist-productivism as such activism as well as its critique run [speed] headlong into their own ecological and linguistic limits.
Other texts by early prominent environmental scholars, like Kate Soper’s fittingly titled ‘Nature/“nature”,’ and Kevin DeLuca’s ‘A Wilderness Environmentalism Manifesto,’ enact the same curious logic, albeit in different ways. DeLuca’s text is particularly interesting because it displays the aporetic madness [absurdity] that underlies the environmentalist project – and I certainly do not mean to say that this madness [absurdity] makes this project illegitimate. Rather, this madness [absurdity] marks the constant and accelerated shuttling between ecological hope and despair under the intensified politics of humanism. Referencing the Greek philosopher Protagoras, DeLuca claims that environmentalism should be done as a ‘wilderness environmentalism, wherein wilderness is the measure of all things,’ rather than humans as the measure of all things (40). But since ‘wilderness,’ as I outlined earlier, is a product of a productivist ‘culture,’ there is in the final analysis no ground for an ethics based on ‘bare nature.’ This means that DeLuca can only make a moral argument by virtue of the humanist-centred ethics that inspired also the environmentalism that he seeks to critique. His earlier points about preserving forests no matter the human interests in them – like the interests of forest-dwelling tribes – indeed appear as immoral or irresponsible towards such people. DeLuca therefore is forced to makes a case that environmentalism is (and should be) beneficial to humanity at large, and he does this by arguing that ‘caring for wilderness is caring for people’ (43). The enactment of his humanist responsibility therefore makes him go full circle to where he started, away from the ‘mad’ [absurd] yet logical claim that the priority should no longer be caring for people. DeLuca’s narrative mirrors the deconstruction that inhabits the paroxysm typical of the accelerated global order. His re-enunciation of the humanist trope makes this circular logic consistent with an increasingly global conception of humanity due to its universalizing gesture, while this global sphere being increasingly unstable. It is out of the accelerated simulation of this tension that I suggest recent climate change activism emerges.
Finally, Kate Soper’s article on the distinction between the ‘mere’ construction and representation of nature, and the ‘real’ nature that environmentalism requires in order to justify its activism, is exemplary in terms of how its argument relates to the formal enunciation and to the mode of production of that argument. The way in which the solution is the problem – namely how the anthropocentric argument that ground the salvation or romanticization of ‘nature’ is itself the anthropogenic problem of climate change – shows up in Soper’s text in the way it ultimately keeps the spirit of environmentalism going. The point at which Soper discerns between ‘nature’ as an image ‘tainted’ by anthropocentric politics and ‘adequately’ represented nature (30) worth fighting for marks exactly the point at which this opposition enters the realm of capital circulation. This entrance into circulation happens by virtue of the energy-consuming typesetting, printing, and dissemination of the book in which her chapter sits, but also by virtue of the assumption of a distinction between representations closer to and further away from the ‘reality’ that informs her argument. I suggest that her desire for finding a language closer to ‘real nature’ – one that revives the environmentalist duty – is borne out of the demand for an ‘alibi’ for humanist activism. Or rather, the analysis of ‘nature’ as social construction demands a politics around ‘real nature’ to be mounted in order to cover over the abyss left by acceleration. This slippage of ‘nature’ between sign and object in her piece results in a curious sensation of activist vertigo; ‘nature’ becomes indeed that sign at which the anthropocentric logic of humanism starts to crumble. Soper’s piece hence unwittingly demonstrates the aporia of humanism – its auto-immunity or deconstruction – by showing that the postmodern critique of the term ‘nature’ in environmentalism follows from an ecological demand regarding its limitations. I am also calling the sensation one gets by reading Soper’s piece a feeling of ‘activist vertigo’ because it feels like a terrified suspension of the self-evidence of environmentalism, as if one – to use a metaphor from nature – stares down an enormous overhang into a ravine. This terror is perhaps the draw towards emptiness or death which activists and academics find inappropriate feelings under the neoliberal demand for human productivity. The fear of ‘not doing’ hence generates a stronger fear for death in late-capitalist cultures, even if dying itself is increasingly relegated to specialist settings, and even if it was perhaps initially the fear of death that gave rise to the humanist discourses of emancipation and (Christian) salvation. ‘Nature’ becomes in this outlook the ultimate object for technological mastery, but equally the ultimate source of revenge and destruction as it channels such mastery back to the human subject, who then becomes its target – or so it appears to us. What really happens is a pervasive re-distribution of death and dying at the hands of the neoliberal machine, in which the elites emerge as the winners in terms of what one calls ‘life-expectancy’ – a fittingly statisticist and managerial expression of which the linguistic ambiguity of ‘nature’ only is symptomatic. The ambiguous appearance and circularity of lethality indeed return in contemporary climate activism, in which for instance the obsession with carbon emissions gets precedence over rescuing peoples threatened by rising sea levels.
The acceleration of the humanist aporia returns in environmentalism as the misconception of nature and wilderness as outside of social institutions, as well as a call to ‘go back to nature.’ This exaltation of ‘nature’ leads quite logically to the simulation of pristine ‘wild’ peoples as a new object of a globalizing nostalgia – a desire to become native or go back to nature. The emergence in the media of and nostalgic longing for unspoiled nature, as the illusion of stable origin and identity, is hence complicit in the productivist order. In many ways, the climate change model reworks certain Christian traits present in humanism, as an updated narrative of ‘our fall from paradise’ engenders a sense of guilt and self-flagellation, which under conditions of acceleration forces an arrogant techno-optimism that spurs ecological activity and represses despair. Simultaneously, the fact that environmentalism claims that assaults on nature are an assault on humanity also complicates the distinction between the social (the human) and the natural. This makes possible my argument that terms like ‘wilderness’ and ‘nature’ somehow gesture towards deconstruction by virtue of the un-decidability of their status either inside or outside the social, or of either true or false. This renders unstable the distinction between subject-agent and object-in-nature, as ‘humanity’ becomes both source and target of action and thought while the natural object seems to take its revenge. The ‘truth’ of climate change and its activism appeal to our basic experience as citizen-consumers under the era of technological and economic acceleration as well as co-construct that experience as a global one, as Beck also suggests. But it also shows that attempts to model or act on nature’s or the globe’s destruction obscures once more the moment at which the humanist-productivist order actually shows itself to be illegitimate. The problem of the environment and their technical solutions then generate a sensation of a humanity ‘running [speeding] towards its own death,’ which may very well be an accurate estimation – or at least, that is what this paper responsibly affirms.",summarize the following text: ,"Everything that invokes Nature invokes the domination of Nature

Since at issue is then the truth of science and its method of empiricist validation through modern technologies, a more radical analysis should reconsider the very division between reality and representation, if only because technological acceleration has made the representation of science (in the media, for instance) into the dominant reality. This complication of the division between reality and representation hence suggests that if climate change exists, then climate change is actually a simulation that dissimulates or obscures another more urgent catastrophe or problem. This in turn might mean that popular climate change activism and thought is implicated in its mobilization for the productivist neoliberal order due to the present-day enmeshment of simulation and acceleration by way of modern technologies. Paradoxically then, this paper must start from the premise that the occurrence of anthropogenic climate change is true, as this would be the responsible and productive position; but it also acknowledges that responsibilities are always constituted in historical and socio-economical imperatives like the humanistic and economistic ones. To overlay the duty of humanism to critique its own duty with the way responsible climate science and activism finds its limitations in the truth-value of the scientific and activist climate change model is then crucial in terms of understanding how a truly radical alternative may emerge from the ambiguous ethics of accelerated humanism. This paper’s performance of this moral imperative hence points to the sheer force of neoliberal globalization; or, one could say that the humanist argument in climate activism that criticizes the inherent limitations of accelerated capitalistic expansion’s non-sustainability directly constitutes this paper’s fundamental ‘ecological’ limitation and argumentative logic. This paper will then mobilize this aporia of contemporary climate activism, which we find accelerated today into the simulation of its veracity, by analysing some exemplary debates around the preservation of ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ in traditional environmentalism. Environmentalism, which took off in terms of a wider scientific and public concern with the publication of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962, provides a good starting point in order to discern which paradoxical tropes and calls for action inform ‘green’ political engagement in general. In its incessant compulsion to cover over its own internal contradictions namely, environmentalism has mutated into climate change activism due to the latter’s heavy indebtedness to scientific and technological attempts at modelling ‘reality’ and making predictions. This analysis agrees with Ulrich Beck’s thesis on risk society in World at Risk, although it does not see the cosmopolitan impetus that arises from risk’s global spread as necessarily positive in terms of political mobilisation. The problem is namely that climate change as a techno-political apparition which is ‘more real than reality itself’ emerges out of the ambiguous representation of ‘nature’ that marked environmentalism, and is as such implicated in the acceleration and magnification of risk through its global political mobilisation. It is in turn out of this ambiguous status of ‘nature’ that the utter force of technological reproduction and acceleration brings about the in-discernability of reality and representation. Under the new conditions of acceleration then, the artificial split between image and truth that has made possible modern science and philosophy since the onset of humanism finally implodes onto itself. Analyses of the relationship between environmentalism and the media should therefore likewise go beyond common descriptions in the social sciences of how the media influence popular opinion around climate change, although such analyses are certainly not without merit. Rather, these analyses should also consider how the illusion of the neutral or transparent communication and representation of ‘nature’ in early environmentalist texts allows for the possibility of climate science’s truth-claims about ‘nature,’ even if such technological acceleration engenders increasing doubt and confusion regarding the truth of climate change and its causes, as well as to the appropriate moral response. In order to elucidate the exemplary status of environmentalist critiques and affirmations of nature in terms of my argument on climate science and activism, I will at this juncture briefly touch on what I see as Jean Baudrillard’s cardinal point throughout his oeuvre. Baudrillard argues in The Mirror of Production as well as in much of his later work that signs become objects for consumption, and that political or conceptual opposition merely sustains the general exploitation of (false) differences for economic growth. What Baudrillard aims at is that the conceptual split of the sign in classical semiotics into signifier and signified constitutes not a universal truth about the generation of meaning, but marks a historically specific moment in a stage of capitalism which Baudrillard designates as ‘productivist.’ What this means is that the difference between nature and culture, or the opposition between the truth and denial of anthropogenic climate change, are themselves markers as well as ingredients of the neoliberal technocratic order. As Baudrillard aptly notes: ‘in the mirror of the economic, Nature looks at us with the eyes of necessity:’ both the ‘sham’ necessity of human production and of salvation (by and of nature) are essentially capitalist simulations (58). The concept of the signified emerges alongside the capitalist model of exchange value as a supposed derivative of use value, but use value in the form of so-called ‘real’ desires, just like the signified or the referent, is simply conjured up as an ‘alibi,’ says Baudrillard in ‘For a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign’ (78), for a capitalism that justifies itself by relying on the assumption that those desires for an ‘unspoiled nature’ are indeed ‘natural.’ Humanism therefore once more appears in activisms that seek the salvation of ‘nature’ as the grounding ideology of accelerated capitalism by virtue of the unquestionable status of the productive human as the agent ‘extracting’ value from ‘nature.’ But this anthropocentrism at the heart of capitalism is exactly also the problem of anthropogenic environmental pollution. It is for this reason that Baudrillard exclaims in The Mirror of Production that ‘the entire rationality of the system of political economy … gravitates … around the concept of Nature’ (53). We can see this ambiguity around ‘nature’ clearly in the paradoxes of even those environmentalist texts that feel rightly uncomfortable with a straightforward affirmation of ‘nature.’ All of them, like also this paper, seem compelled by that sheer force of neoliberal acceleration to reproduce the ideal of the humanist-activist subject even if that very subject is also designated as the problem underlying ecological disaster. One of the key texts that began to critique ‘nature’ and ‘wilderness’ as a construction is William Cronon’s ‘The Trouble with Wilderness.’ Cronon argues rather convincingly that the romantic call for the preservation of ‘wilderness’ is rife with racism and sexism. This racism and sexism shows itself in the highly prevalent idea in environmentalism of nature as ‘feminine’ and ‘primitive,’ thus showing that the notion of nature ‘serves as the unexamined foundation on which so many of the quasi-religious values of environmentalism rest’ (14, 10). Modern environmentalism then exhibits for Cronon a form of anthropocentric arrogance because it assumes that humanity has the power to destroy as well as rescue wilderness. Nonetheless, Cronon suggests at the end of his piece that the idea of the ‘wild’ and of ‘nature’ has some merit since it also exactly signifies that which is beyond human control, and he uses this potential of them being ‘outside’ in order to reinstate the environmentalist endeavour (19). I argue that it is the indeterminability of whether the ‘wild’ or ‘nature’ is inside or outside culture that allows Cronon to make an appeal to a ‘real’ wilderness which in turn salvages the scientific and humanist quest of our or its emancipation. But this split between complicit and real wilderness in Cronon’s piece is eventually a false distinction, which difference becomes implicated in accelerated technological reproduction by remobilising the human political agent and his capitalist relation to ‘nature.’ It is by virtue of the ambiguity of the status of the term that Cronon can enact the humanist ‘trick’ of giving environmentalism its politics back, thereby remaining faithful to the activist duty and its complicities in the productivist order. The moral impetus that informs Cronon’s critique allows for a political re-enablement that dissimulates the humanist aporia and its complicity in a non-sustainable economy. Perhaps a mere constructionist critique of environmentalism does not go far enough to unsettle the general logic of humanist-productivism as such activism as well as its critique run [speed] headlong into their own ecological and linguistic limits. Other texts by early prominent environmental scholars, like Kate Soper’s fittingly titled ‘Nature/“nature”,’ and Kevin DeLuca’s ‘A Wilderness Environmentalism Manifesto,’ enact the same curious logic, albeit in different ways. DeLuca’s text is particularly interesting because it displays the aporetic madness [absurdity] that underlies the environmentalist project – and I certainly do not mean to say that this madness [absurdity] makes this project illegitimate. Rather, this madness [absurdity] marks the constant and accelerated shuttling between ecological hope and despair under the intensified politics of humanism. Referencing the Greek philosopher Protagoras, DeLuca claims that environmentalism should be done as a ‘wilderness environmentalism, wherein wilderness is the measure of all things,’ rather than humans as the measure of all things (40). But since ‘wilderness,’ as I outlined earlier, is a product of a productivist ‘culture,’ there is in the final analysis no ground for an ethics based on ‘bare nature.’ This means that DeLuca can only make a moral argument by virtue of the humanist-centred ethics that inspired also the environmentalism that he seeks to critique. His earlier points about preserving forests no matter the human interests in them – like the interests of forest-dwelling tribes – indeed appear as immoral or irresponsible towards such people. DeLuca therefore is forced to makes a case that environmentalism is (and should be) beneficial to humanity at large, and he does this by arguing that ‘caring for wilderness is caring for people’ (43). The enactment of his humanist responsibility therefore makes him go full circle to where he started, away from the ‘mad’ [absurd] yet logical claim that the priority should no longer be caring for people. DeLuca’s narrative mirrors the deconstruction that inhabits the paroxysm typical of the accelerated global order. His re-enunciation of the humanist trope makes this circular logic consistent with an increasingly global conception of humanity due to its universalizing gesture, while this global sphere being increasingly unstable. It is out of the accelerated simulation of this tension that I suggest recent climate change activism emerges. Finally, Kate Soper’s article on the distinction between the ‘mere’ construction and representation of nature, and the ‘real’ nature that environmentalism requires in order to justify its activism, is exemplary in terms of how its argument relates to the formal enunciation and to the mode of production of that argument. The way in which the solution is the problem – namely how the anthropocentric argument that ground the salvation or romanticization of ‘nature’ is itself the anthropogenic problem of climate change – shows up in Soper’s text in the way it ultimately keeps the spirit of environmentalism going. The point at which Soper discerns between ‘nature’ as an image ‘tainted’ by anthropocentric politics and ‘adequately’ represented nature (30) worth fighting for marks exactly the point at which this opposition enters the realm of capital circulation. This entrance into circulation happens by virtue of the energy-consuming typesetting, printing, and dissemination of the book in which her chapter sits, but also by virtue of the assumption of a distinction between representations closer to and further away from the ‘reality’ that informs her argument. I suggest that her desire for finding a language closer to ‘real nature’ – one that revives the environmentalist duty – is borne out of the demand for an ‘alibi’ for humanist activism. Or rather, the analysis of ‘nature’ as social construction demands a politics around ‘real nature’ to be mounted in order to cover over the abyss left by acceleration. This slippage of ‘nature’ between sign and object in her piece results in a curious sensation of activist vertigo; ‘nature’ becomes indeed that sign at which the anthropocentric logic of humanism starts to crumble. Soper’s piece hence unwittingly demonstrates the aporia of humanism – its auto-immunity or deconstruction – by showing that the postmodern critique of the term ‘nature’ in environmentalism follows from an ecological demand regarding its limitations. I am also calling the sensation one gets by reading Soper’s piece a feeling of ‘activist vertigo’ because it feels like a terrified suspension of the self-evidence of environmentalism, as if one – to use a metaphor from nature – stares down an enormous overhang into a ravine. This terror is perhaps the draw towards emptiness or death which activists and academics find inappropriate feelings under the neoliberal demand for human productivity. The fear of ‘not doing’ hence generates a stronger fear for death in late-capitalist cultures, even if dying itself is increasingly relegated to specialist settings, and even if it was perhaps initially the fear of death that gave rise to the humanist discourses of emancipation and (Christian) salvation. ‘Nature’ becomes in this outlook the ultimate object for technological mastery, but equally the ultimate source of revenge and destruction as it channels such mastery back to the human subject, who then becomes its target – or so it appears to us. What really happens is a pervasive re-distribution of death and dying at the hands of the neoliberal machine, in which the elites emerge as the winners in terms of what one calls ‘life-expectancy’ – a fittingly statisticist and managerial expression of which the linguistic ambiguity of ‘nature’ only is symptomatic. The ambiguous appearance and circularity of lethality indeed return in contemporary climate activism, in which for instance the obsession with carbon emissions gets precedence over rescuing peoples threatened by rising sea levels. The acceleration of the humanist aporia returns in environmentalism as the misconception of nature and wilderness as outside of social institutions, as well as a call to ‘go back to nature.’ This exaltation of ‘nature’ leads quite logically to the simulation of pristine ‘wild’ peoples as a new object of a globalizing nostalgia – a desire to become native or go back to nature. The emergence in the media of and nostalgic longing for unspoiled nature, as the illusion of stable origin and identity, is hence complicit in the productivist order. In many ways, the climate change model reworks certain Christian traits present in humanism, as an updated narrative of ‘our fall from paradise’ engenders a sense of guilt and self-flagellation, which under conditions of acceleration forces an arrogant techno-optimism that spurs ecological activity and represses despair. Simultaneously, the fact that environmentalism claims that assaults on nature are an assault on humanity also complicates the distinction between the social (the human) and the natural. This makes possible my argument that terms like ‘wilderness’ and ‘nature’ somehow gesture towards deconstruction by virtue of the un-decidability of their status either inside or outside the social, or of either true or false. This renders unstable the distinction between subject-agent and object-in-nature, as ‘humanity’ becomes both source and target of action and thought while the natural object seems to take its revenge. The ‘truth’ of climate change and its activism appeal to our basic experience as citizen-consumers under the era of technological and economic acceleration as well as co-construct that experience as a global one, as Beck also suggests. But it also shows that attempts to model or act on nature’s or the globe’s destruction obscures once more the moment at which the humanist-productivist order actually shows itself to be illegitimate. The problem of the environment and their technical solutions then generate a sensation of a humanity ‘running [speeding] towards its own death,’ which may very well be an accurate estimation – or at least, that is what this paper responsibly affirms.",summarize the following text: ,"climate change activism, as well as the scientific evidence for anthropogenic climate change, in their opposition

false opposition in that it remains complicit in the humanist and productivist techno-scientific ordering of the world in which the human is supposedly the central actor or producer the incessant jumbling over one another of this debate in the media is a simulation of climate politics insofar this debate itself becomes an ingredient for economic acceleration Since the current activism and debate on the environment fails to deepen its critique sufficiently in light of the exponentially raised stakes under economic techno-acceleration, a more radical critique of the climate conundrum

"Hegel’s dialectical thinking powerfully exploits the idea of negation. It is a central feature of spirit and consciousness that they have the power to negate. The spirit “is this power only by looking the negative in the face and tarrying with it. This […] is the magical power that converts it into being.”102 The tarrying with the negative is part of what Hegel calls the “labour of the negative”103. In a loose reference to this Hegelian notion Gerald Postema points to yet another feature of disagreements as a necessary ingredient of the process of practical reasoning. Only if our reasoning is exposed to contrary arguments can we test its merits. We must go through the “labor of the negative” to have trust in our deliberative processes.104 This also holds where we seem to be in agreement. Agreement without exposure to disagreement can be deceptive in various ways. The first phenomenon Postema draws attention to is the group polarization effect. When a group of like‐minded people deliberates an issue, informational and reputational cascades produce more extreme views in the process of their deliberations.105 The polarization and biases that are well documented for such groups106 can be countered at least in some settings by the inclusion of dissenting voices. In these scenarios, disagreement can be a cure for dysfunctional deliberative polarization and biases.107 A second deliberative dysfunction mitigated by disagreement is superficial agreement, which can even be manipulatively used in the sense of a “presumptuous ‘We’”108. Disagreement can help to police such distortions of deliberative processes by challenging superficial agreements. Disagreements may thus signal that a deliberative process is not contaminated with dysfunctional agreements stemming from polarization or superficiality. Protecting our discourse against such contaminations is valuable even if we do not come to terms. Each of the opposing positions will profit from the catharsis it received “by looking the negative in the face and tarrying with it”. These advantages of disagreement in collective deliberations are mirrored on the individual level. Even if the probability of reaching a consensus with our opponents is very low from the beginning, as might be the case in deeply entrenched conflicts, entering into an exchange of arguments can still serve to test and improve our position. We have to do the “labor of the negative” for ourselves. Even if we cannot come up with a line of argument that coheres well with everybody else’s beliefs, attitudes and dispositions, we can still come up with a line of argument that achieves this goal for our own personal beliefs, attitudes and dispositions. To provide ourselves with the most coherent system of our own beliefs, attitudes and dispositions is – at least in important issues – an aspect of personal integrity – to borrow one of Dworkin’s favorite expressions for a less aspirational idea. In hard cases we must – in some way – lay out the argument for ourselves to figure out what we believe to be the right answer. We might not know what we believe ourselves in questions of abortion, the death penalty, torture, and stem cell research, until we have developed a line of argument against the background of our subjective beliefs, attitudes and dispositions. In these cases it might be rational to discuss the issue with someone unlikely to share some of our more fundamental convictions or who opposes the view towards which we lean. This might even be the most helpful way of corroborating a view, because we know that our adversary is much more motivated to find a potential flaw in our argument than someone with whom we know we are in agreement. It might be more helpful to discuss a liberal position with Scalia than with Breyer if we want to make sure that we have not overlooked some counter‐argument to our case. It would be too narrow an understanding of our practice of legal disagreement and argumentation if we restricted its purpose to persuading an adversary in the case at hand and inferred from this narrow understanding the irrationality of argumentation in hard cases, in which we know beforehand that we will not be able to persuade. Rational argumentation is a much more complex practice in a more complex social framework. Argumentation with an adversary can have purposes beyond persuading him: to test one’s own convictions, to engage our opponent in inferential commitments and to persuade third parties are only some of these; to rally our troops or express our convictions might be others. To make our peace with Kant we could say that “there must be a hope of coming to terms” with someone though not necessarily with our opponent, but maybe only a third party or even just ourselves and not necessarily only on the issue at hand, but maybe through inferential commitments in a different arena. f) The Advantage Over Non‐Argumentative Alternatives It goes without saying that in real world legal disagreements, all of the reasons listed above usually play in concert and will typically hold true to different degrees relative to different participants in the debate: There will be some participants for whom our hope of coming to terms might still be justified and others for whom only some of the other reasons hold and some for whom it is a mixture of all of the reasons in shifting degrees as our disagreements evolve. It is also apparent that, with the exception of the first reason, the rationality of our disagreements is of a secondary nature. The rational does not lie in the discovery of a single right answer to the topic of debate, since in hard cases there are no single right answers. Instead, our disagreements are instrumental to rationales which lie beyond the topic at hand, like the exploration of our communalities or of our inferential commitments. Since these reasons are of this secondary nature, they must stand up to alternative ways of settling irreconcilable disagreements that have other secondary reasons in their favor – like swiftness of decision making or using fewer resources. Why does our legal practice require lengthy arguments and discursive efforts even in appellate or supreme court cases of irreconcilable legal disagreements? The closure has to come by some non‐argumentative mean and courts have always relied on them. For the medieval courts of the Germanic tradition it is bequeathed that judges had to fight it out literally if they disagreed on a question of law – though the king allowed them to pick surrogate fighters.109 It is understandable that the process of civilization has led us to non‐violent non‐ argumentative means to determine the law. But what was wrong with District Judge Currin of Umatilla County in Oregon, who – in his late days – decided inconclusive traffic violations by publicly flipping a coin?110 If we are counting heads at the end of our lengthy argumentative proceedings anyway, why not decide hard cases by gut voting at the outset and spare everybody the cost of developing elaborate arguments on questions, where there is not fact of the matter to be discovered? One reason lies in the mixed nature of our reasons in actual legal disagreements. The different second order reasons can be held apart analytically, but not in real life cases. The hope of coming to terms will often play a role at least for some time relative to some participants in the debate. A second reason is that the objectives listed above could not be achieved by a non‐argumentative procedure. Flipping a coin, throwing dice or taking a gut vote would not help us to explore our communalities or our inferential commitments nor help to scrutinize the positions in play. A third reason is the overall rational aspiration of the law that Dworkin relates to in his integrity account111. In a justificatory sense112 the law aspires to give a coherent account of itself – even if it is not the only right one – required by equal respect under conditions of normative disagreement.113 Combining legal argumentation with the non‐argumentative decision‐ making procedure of counting reasoned opinions serves the coherence aspiration of the law in at least two ways: First, the labor of the negative reduces the chances that constructions of the law that have major flaws or inconsistencies built into the arguments supporting them will prevail. Second, since every position must be a reasoned one within the given framework of the law, it must be one that somehow fits into the overall structure of the law along coherent lines. It thus protects against incoherent “checkerboard” treatments114 of hard cases. It is the combination of reasoned disagreement and the non‐rational decision‐making mechanism of counting reasoned opinions that provides for both in hard cases: a decision and one – of multiple possible – coherent constructions of the law. Pure non‐rational procedures – like flipping a coin – would only provide for the decision part. Pure argumentative procedures – which are not geared towards a decision procedure – would undercut the incentive structure of our agonistic disagreements.115 In the face of unresolvable disagreements endless debates would seem an idle enterprise. That the debates are about winning or losing helps to keep the participants engaged. That the decision depends on counting reasoned opinions guarantees that the engagement focuses on rational argumentation. No plain non‐argumentative procedure would achieve this result. If the judges were to flip a coin at the end of the trial in hard cases, there would be little incentive to engage in an exchange of arguments. It is specifically the count of reasoned opinions which provides for rational scrutiny in our legal disagreements and thus contributes to the rationales discussed above. 2. THE SEMANTICS OF AGONISTIC DISAGREEMENTS The agonistic account does not presuppose a fact of the matter, it is not accompanied by an ontological commitment, and the question of how the fact of the matter could be known to us is not even raised. Thus the agonistic account of legal disagreement is not confronted with the metaphysical or epistemological questions that plague one‐right‐answer theories in particular. However, it must still come up with a semantics that explains in what sense we disagree about the same issue and are not just talking at cross purposes. In a series of articles David Plunkett and Tim Sundell have reconstructed legal disagreements in semantic terms as metalinguistic negotiations on the usage of a term that at the center of a hard case like “cruel and unusual punishment” in a death‐penalty case.116 Even though the different sides in the debate define the term differently, they are not talking past each other, since they are engaged in a metalinguistic negotiation on the use of the same term. The metalinguistic negotiation on the use of the term serves as a semantic anchor for a disagreement on the substantive issues connected with the term because of its functional role in the law. The “cruel and unusual punishment”‐clause thus serves to argue about the permissibility of the death penalty. This account, however only provides a very superficial semantic commonality. But the commonality between the participants of a legal disagreement go deeper than a discussion whether the term “bank” should in future only to be used for financial institutions, which fulfills every criteria for semantic negotiations that Plunkett and Sundell propose. Unlike in mere semantic negotiations, like the on the disambiguation of the term “bank”, there is also some kind of identity of the substantive issues at stake in legal disagreements. A promising route to capture this aspect of legal disagreements might be offered by recent semantic approaches that try to accommodate the externalist challenges of realist semantics,117 which inspire one‐right‐answer theorists like Moore or David Brink. Neo‐ descriptivist and two‐valued semantics provide for the theoretical or interpretive element of realist semantics without having to commit to the ontological positions of traditional externalism. In a sense they offer externalist semantics with no ontological strings attached. The less controversial aspect of the externalist picture of meaning developed in neo‐ descriptivist and two‐valued semantics can be found in the deferential structure that our meaning‐providing intentions often encompass.118 In the case of natural kinds, speakers defer to the expertise of chemists when they employ natural kind terms like gold or water. If a speaker orders someone to buy $ 10,000 worth of gold as a safe investment, he might not know the exact atomic structure of the chemical element 79. In cases of doubt, though, he would insist that he meant to buy only stuff that chemical experts – or the markets for that matter – qualify as gold. The deferential element in the speaker’s intentions provides for the specific externalist element of the semantics. In the case of the law, the meaning‐providing intentions connected to the provisions of the law can be understood to defer in a similar manner to the best overall theory or interpretation of the legal materials. Against the background of such a semantic framework the conceptual unity of a linguistic practice is not ratified by the existence of a single best answer, but by the unity of the interpretive effort that extends to legal materials and legal practices that have sufficient overlap119 – be it only in a historical perspective120. The fulcrum of disagreement that Dworkin sees in the existence of a single right answer121 does not lie in its existence, but in the communality of the effort – if only on the basis of an overlapping common ground of legal materials, accepted practices, experiences and dispositions. As two athletes are engaged in the same contest when they follow the same rules, share the same concept of winning and losing and act in the same context, but follow very different styles of e.g. wrestling, boxing, swimming etc. They are in the same contest, even if there is no single best style in which to wrestle, box or swim. Each, however, is engaged in developing the best style to win against their opponent, just as two lawyers try to develop the best argument to convince a bench of judges.122 Within such a semantic framework even people with radically opposing views about the application of an expression can still share a concept, in that they are engaged in the same process of theorizing over roughly the same legal materials and practices. Semantic frameworks along these lines allow for adamant disagreements without abandoning the idea that people are talking about the same concept. An agonistic account of legal disagreement can build on such a semantic framework, which can explain in what sense lawyers, judges and scholars engaged in agonistic disagreements are not talking past each other. They are engaged in developing the best interpretation of roughly the same legal materials, albeit against the background of diverging beliefs, attitudes and dispositions that lead them to divergent conclusions in hard cases. Despite the divergent conclusions, semantic unity is provided by the largely overlapping legal materials that form the basis for their disagreement. Such a semantic collapses only when we lack a sufficient overlap in the materials. To use an example of Michael Moore’s: If we wanted to debate whether a certain work of art was “just”, we share neither paradigms nor a tradition of applying the concept of justice to art such as to engage in an intelligible controversy.
Aff cases fall in a continuum from argument to nonargument where the argument side includes inferential leaps, choices among competing claims, and a willingness to risk confrontation.  Claims that are not up for dispute, or ought not be disputed, do not constitute a SIGNIFICANT argument.  The aff must be placed within the context of the critic and confronter – even if their claims are contestable writ large, if they are not contestable within this context the aff has failed to generate an argument and should be rejected.

By ""argument"" I mean the process whereby a person reasons his way from one idea to the choice of another idea.  This concept of argument implies five generic characteristics: (1) an inferential leap from existing beliefs to the adoption of a new belief or the reinforcement of an old one; (2) a perceived rationale to justify that leap; (3) a choice among two or more competing claims; (4) a regulation of uncertainty in relation to the selected claim – since someone has made an inferential leap, certainty can be neither zero nor total; and (5) a willingness to risk a confrontation of that claim with one’s peers.  These characteristics can be viewed either from the point of view of a critic-arguer or a reader-confronter, either of whom can determine whether from the perspective of these five characteristics an argument has been made or is in process.  One should never forget that a person, whether a critic or a confronter, is involved in argument and will determine whether an experience constitutes an argument.  For it is a person who makes an inferential leap, perceives a rationale, makes a choice, regulates an uncertainty, and risks a confrontation. This definition, involving five characteristics considered organically rather than additively, implies an argument-nonargument continuum.  Any concrete rhetorical experience may embody these characteristics in varying degrees.  Any characteristic may operate too minimally for a critic or a confronter to place the experience very near the argument end of the continuum, even though other characteristics may function more nearly optimally.  Perhaps an inferential leap is made but is too narrow or too uninteresting for a critic or a confronter to call it an argument.  Perhaps a rationale is implied but is not strong enough or clear enough for a critic or a confronter to justify the label of “argument”. Or all of the characteristics of argument may operate but a critic or a confronter may believe that the experience, considered as an organic whole, fails to constitute an argument.  This definition of argument places near the nonargument end of the continuum several kinds of rhetorical experience sometimes thought of as argument.  For example, neither the assertion of a true believer’s insistence on a non-negotiable position nor the syllogistic entailment of a conclusion through manipulating premises within a close system function significantly as an argument.  If a claim is virtually a foregone conclusion, one which for any reason is not seen as open to dispute, then it is much more nearly nonargument than it is argument: no significant inferential leap has been made; little or no rationale has been asked for or given; only one claim is seen as worth considering thoroughly; that claim is accepted with certainty or virtual certainty; and no one has taken much risk of confrontation if any.  My point is this: a critic-arguer or a confronter-reader may perceive a rhetorical experience as embodying the five characteristics in varying degrees.  A rhetorical experience will not seem much of an argument if that person thinks it virtually ignores one or more of the characteristics, nor will it seem much of an argument if he thinks it includes most or all of the characteristics but in a limited way.  A significant argument is one which, from the point of view of a person, collectively achieves the five characteristics of an argument adequately.  In this essay I shall argue that useful rhetorical criticism must function as significant argument whether the criticism is an evaluation or an analysis of a rhetorical experience.",summarize the following text: ,"the idea of negation is central the “labour of the negative” points to disagreements as a necessary ingredient of the process of practical reasoning. Only if our reasoning is exposed to contrary arguments can we test its merits. We must go through the “labor of the negative” to have trust in our deliberative processes Agreement without exposure to disagreement can be deceptive The first phenomenon is group polarization The polarization and biases that are well documented for such groups can be countered by the inclusion of dissenting voices disagreement can be a cure for dysfunctional deliberative polarization and biases A second dysfunction is superficial agreement Disagreement can help by challenging superficial agreements Protecting our discourse against such contaminations is valuable even if we do not come to terms. Each of the opposing positions will profit from the catharsis it received “by looking the negative in the face and tarrying with it”. Even if the probability of reaching a consensus with our opponents is very low from the beginning entering into an exchange of arguments can still serve to test and improve our position. We have to do the “labor of the negative” for ourselves. Even if we cannot come up with a line of argument that coheres well with everybody else’s beliefs we can still come up with a line of argument that achieves this goal for our own personal beliefs In hard cases we must lay out the argument for ourselves to figure out what we believe to be the right answer. We might not know what we believe ourselves until we have developed a line of argument against the background of our subjective beliefs, attitudes and dispositions it might be rational to discuss the issue with someone unlikely to share some of our more fundamental convictions or who opposes the view towards which we lean. This might even be the most helpful way of corroborating a view, because we know that our adversary is much more motivated to find a potential flaw in our argument than someone with whom we know we are in agreement It would be too narrow an understanding of our practice of disagreement and argumentation if we restricted its purpose to persuading an adversary in the case at hand and inferred from this narrow understanding the irrationality of argumentation in hard cases Argumentation with an adversary can have purposes beyond persuading to test one’s own convictions, to engage our opponent in inferential commitments and to persuade third parties are only some of these; to rally our troops or express our convictions might be others the rationality of our disagreements is of a secondary nature. The rational does not lie in the discovery of a single right answer to the topic of debate our disagreements are instrumental to rationales which lie beyond the topic at hand, like the exploration of our communalities or of our inferential commitments. Since these reasons are of this secondary nature, they must stand up to alternative ways of settling irreconcilable disagreements Why does our legal practice require lengthy arguments and discursive efforts The closure has to come by some non‐argumentative mean what was wrong with flipping a coin why not decide hard cases by gut voting at the outset and spare everybody the cost of developing elaborate arguments on questions, where there is not fact of the matter to be discovered? the objectives listed above could not be achieved by a non‐argumentative procedure taking a gut vote would not help us to explore our communalities or our inferential commitments nor help to scrutinize the positions in play the law aspires to give a coherent account of itself – even if it is not the only right one – required by equal respect under conditions of normative disagreement Combining legal argumentation with the non‐argumentative decision‐ making procedure of counting reasoned opinions serves the coherence aspiration of the law the labor of the negative reduces the chances that constructions of the law that have major flaws or inconsistencies built into the arguments supporting them will prevail since every position must be a reasoned one within the given framework of the law, it must be one that somehow fits into the overall structure of the law along coherent lines. It thus protects against incoherent “checkerboard” treatments of hard cases. It is the combination of reasoned disagreement and the non‐rational decision‐making mechanism of counting reasoned opinions that provides for both in hard cases Pure non‐rational procedures would only provide for the decision part. Pure argumentative procedures – which are not geared towards a decision procedure – would undercut the incentive structure of our agonistic disagreements That the debates are about winning or losing helps to keep the participants engaged. That the decision depends on counting reasoned opinions guarantees that the engagement focuses on rational argumentation If the judges were to flip a coin there would be little incentive to engage in an exchange of arguments. It is specifically the count of reasoned opinions which provides for rational scrutiny in our legal disagreements the agonistic account must come up with a semantics that explains in what sense we disagree about the same issue and are not just talking at cross purposes Even though the different sides in the debate define the term differently, they are not talking past each other, since they are engaged in negotiation on the same term. the term serves as a semantic anchor for a disagreement on the substantive issues The fulcrum of disagreement does not lie in its existence, but in the communality of the effort – if only on the basis of an overlapping common ground of legal materials, accepted practices, experiences and dispositions. As two athletes are engaged in the same contest when they follow the same rules, share the same concept of winning and losing and act in the same context, but follow very different styles They are in the same contest, even if there is no single best style Each is engaged in developing the best style to win against their opponent, just as two lawyers try to develop the best argument to convince judges Within such a semantic framework even people with radically opposing views about the application of an expression can still share a concept, in that they are engaged in the same process of theorizing over roughly the same legal materials and practices Semantic frameworks along these lines allow for adamant disagreements without abandoning the idea that people are talking about the same concept An agonistic framework can explain in what sense scholars engaged in agonistic disagreements are not talking past each other. They are engaged in developing the best interpretation of roughly the same materials, albeit against the background of diverging beliefs, attitudes and dispositions that lead them to divergent conclusions semantic unity is provided by the largely overlapping legal materials that form the basis for their disagreement. Such a semantic collapses only when we lack a sufficient overlap in the materials

For those familiar with the environmental security field, particularly neo-Malthusian models of environmental conflict developed in the 1980s and 1990s, climate refugee and conflict narratives seem very much like old wine in a new bottle. The vintage goes back even further, however, to a powerful policy narrative that I call the ‘degradation narrative’ (Hartmann and Hendrixson, 2005; Hartmann, 2006). Drawing on old colonial stereotypes of destructive Third World peasants and herders, degradation narratives go something like this: population-pressure induced poverty makes Third World peasants degrade their environments by over-farming or over-grazing marginal lands. The ensuing soil depletion and desertification then lead them to migrate elsewhere as ‘environmental refugees’, either to other ecologically vulnerable rural areas where the vicious cycle is once again set in motion or to cities where they strain scarce resources and become a primary source of political instability. Despite salient critiques by international development scholars and practitioners (for example, Boserup, 1965; Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987; Williams, 1995; Leach and Mearns, 1996; Thompson, 2000), the degradation narrative has proved particularly popular in Western policy circles because it kills a number of birds with one stone: it blames poverty on population pressure, and not, for example, on lack of land reform or off-farm employment opportunities; it blames peasants for land degradation, obscuring the role of commercial agriculture and extractive industries and it targets migration both as an environmental and security threat. With the waning of the Cold War, growing interest in sustainable development and alternative visions of security increased the authority of the degradation narrative. In particular, concern began to mount about the dangers posed by so-called ‘environmental refugees’. Central to the concept is the assumption that population pressure is one of the main precipitating causes of environmental degradation and resulting migration (Saunders, 2000). Myers (1995) further popularised and legitimised the concept of environmental refugees offering a working definition: Environmental refugees are persons who can no longer gain a secure livelihood in their traditional homelands because of environmental factors of unusual scope, notably drought, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, water shortages and climate change [my emphasis], also natural disaster such as cyclones, storm surges and floods. In face of these environmental threats, people feel they have no alternative but to seek sustenance elsewhere, whether within their own countries or beyond and whether on a semi-permanent or permanent basis. (Myers, 1995, pp. 18–19) In many cases, Myers wrote, environmental refugees are actually ‘population pressure’ refugees (p. 63). The report made the statistical claim that there were at least 25 million environmental refugees in the world, compared with 22 million refugees of ‘traditional kind’ (p. 1). Despite the fact that the 25 million figure was arrived at more by conjecture than scientific method,1 it began to circulate widely in the international policy arena (Saunders, 2000; Nordas and Gleditsch, 2007). Now Myers claims there will be 200 million climate migrants by 2050, a figure which is similarly making the rounds in policy documents even though Myers himself acknowledges that the estimate is based on ‘heroic extrapolations’ (Brown, 2008, p. 8). In addition to unreliable statistics, the ‘environmental refugee’ concept has a number of shortcomings. It naturalises the economic and political causes of environmental degradation and masks the role of institutional responses to it. Should people forced to leave their homelands because of the development of a large dam, mine tailings, petroleum pollution or flooding caused by illegal logging all be categorised together as ‘environmental refugees’? In the case of extreme natural events such as droughts, storms and floods, whether or not people are forced to migrate permanently from their homes usually depends on pre-existing social relations (who is most vulnerable) and post-disaster responses (what kind of aid/relief is provided and who receives it). (Wisner et al., 2004). Rooted as it is in neo-Malthusian thinking, the concept of ‘environmental refugee’ overemphasises the role of demographic pressures in migration. The causes of migration are extremely complex and context-specific, and moreover, there is little evidence to support the view that demographic pressure is at the root of many population movements (Suhrke, 1997). In addition, negative neo-Malthusian narratives of migration obscure the positive roles migration can play in improving people’s livelihoods and diminishing vulnerability to environmental change. Often, migration from rural areas is not a linear phenomenon or a rejection of rural livelihoods, but is instead a vital part of sustaining them (Black, 1998). Despite such shortcomings, the environmental refugee concept was deployed by a variety of political actors. Sustainable development advocates found it useful to focus policy attention on environmental degradation issues (Black, 1998) and it also appealed to Western interests in favour of more rigid immigration controls, including limiting the grounds for political asylum. Kibreab argues that the term was invented in part to ‘depoliticise the causes of displacement’ so that states would not have the obligation to provide asylum (Kibreab, 1997, p. 21, cited in Saunders, 2000, p. 240). As the concept gained favour, environmental refugees were increasingly portrayed as a security threat, even though there was little serious research to substantiate the claim (Black, 1998). In the 1990s, political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon propelled the degradation narrative and its negative depiction of migration into the ‘high politics’ of national security. Homer-Dixon’s (1999) environmental conflict model maintains that scarcities of renewable resources such as cropland, fresh water, and forests, induced in large part by population growth, contribute to migration and violent intrastate conflict in many parts of the developing world. In his own words: Population growth and unequal access to good land force huge numbers of people onto marginal lands. There, they cause environmental damage and become chronically poor. Eventually, they may be the source of persistent upheaval, or they may migrate yet again, helping to stimulate ethnic conflicts or urban unrest elsewhere (Homer-Dixon, 1999, p. 155). This conflict, in turn, can potentially disrupt international security as states fragment or become more authoritarian (for a critique of his model, see Hartmann, 2001). Homer-Dixon’s work had a major influence in Washington, DC policy circles particularly in the early years of the Clinton administration when Al Gore championed the environment as a cause. Its legacy persists today in the climate change arena where degradation narratives again link environmental change to violent conflict. UNEP’s report on Sudan, for example, draws on Homer-Dixon’s model and related research to make claims that overpopulation of both people and livestock, coupled with environmental stresses such as water shortages related to climate change, are at the root of conflict in the region (UNEP, 2007). Atlantic Monthly journalist Stephan Faris similarly argues that the real fault lines in Darfur are between ‘settled farmers and nomadic herders fighting over failing lands.’ And he attributes the failure of those lands primarily to climate changeinduced reductions in rainfall. ‘With countries across the region and around the world suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos’ (Faris, 2007). The narrative ignores basic elements of Sudanese political economy that helped create and sustain the conflict. These include gross inequalities in wealth and power between the elite in the capital and the rural population; government agricultural policies that favour large mechanised farms and irrigation schemes over rain-fed, small farmer agriculture, causing both political grievances and land degradation; forced migration, such as the 1990s removal of Nuba farmers from their lands into so-called ‘peace villages’ where they became a source of captive labour for mechanised farms; and what Alex de Waal calls ‘militarised tribalism’ (deWaal, 2007). In particular, the nationalisation of land in 1970, by which customary laws were set aside and people could obtain access only through lease agreements with the government, set the stage for widespread land-grabbing by elites and the marginalisation of pastoralists. As one scholar of the region notes, ‘. . .not all resource conflicts are based on a situation of resource scarcity; rather, they are political in nature and have to do with the workings of the Sudanese state’ (Manger, 2005, p. 135). The discovery of a vast underground aquifer underneath Northern Darfur is not likely to diffuse the crisis, but rather to heighten it, if the government controls the water for its own interests (Polgreen, 2007). The construction of Darfur as a climate conflict should serve as canary in the coal mine that something is amiss when environmental determinism overrides serious analysis of power relations. This is not to deny that environmental changes due to global warming could in some instances exacerbate already existing economic and political divisions. However, whether or not violent conflict and mass migrations result depends on so many other factors that it is far too simplistic to see climate change as a major cause or trigger. Moreover, such threat scenarios ignore the way many poorly resourced communities manage their affairs without recourse to violence. Brown et al. (2007) cite the case of the semi-arid regions of Northern Nigeria where conflicts between pastoralists and agricultural communities occur over water and fodder, but seldom spread because of the existence of traditional conflict resolution institutions. They argue that helping these communities adapt to climate change should involve strengthening such institutions. Research in the drylands of Marsabit District in Northern Kenya found that, in times of drought and water scarcity, there was actually less violence, not more (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007). Poor herdsmen were not inclined to start fights during droughts, and despite poverty and population growth in the region, strong but flexible common property regimes governing water helped people adjust to its scarcity. ‘If at any time a conflict over a scarce natural resource like water exists,’ the authors write, ‘it can be a sign that local resource users themselves have been made powerless and that their negotiating system has been paralysed, either by external agencies or local elites’ (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007, p. 235). A study done in northern Senegal from 1998–2002 concluded that drought-related migration led pastoralists to develop better strategies to manage herds and also had positive repercussions on the communities where they settled due to expansion of agriculture and trade (Juul, 2005). In fact, there is a rich body of empirical case studies of African agriculture, pastoralism and forestry that challenges conventional neo-Malthusian narratives about population, scarcity and conflict (e.g. Leach and Mearns, 1996; Gausset et al., 2005; Derman et al., 2007). Yet it is hardly ever cited in the environmental conflict or climate conflict literature. A certain exceptionalism is at work—while it is commonly assumed that scarcity can lead to institutional and technological innovation in more affluent countries, just the opposite is assumed for poor people in less affluent countries. Scarcity renders them into victims/ villains, incapable of innovation or livelihood diversification and naturally prone to violence. Also neglected in the climate conflict literature is scholarship that connects violent conflict in Africa more closely to resource abundance (e.g. rich oil and mineral reserves, valuable timber and diamonds) than resource scarcity (e.g. Fairhead, 2001). Today, critiques of ‘climate conflict’ are emerging. For example, regarding the implications of climate change for armed conflict, Buhaug et al. (2008) note the difficulty of coming up with any generalisable model since increased likelihood of organised violence ‘depends crucially on country-specific and contextual factors’ (p. 2). The report concludes that alarm about climate conflict is not based on substantive evidence. The term ‘climate refugees’ is also coming under increased scrutiny on a number of grounds. First, while climate change is likely to cause displacement, the extent of that displacement will not only depend on how much the temperature rises and affects sealevels, rainfall patterns and extreme weather, but also on the existence and effectiveness of adaptation measures that help individuals and communities cope with environmental stresses. Whether or not such measures are in place in turn depends on political economies at the local, regional, national and international levels that are often conveniently left out of the discussion of so-called ‘climate refugees.’ As one report points out, larger climaterelated humanitarian emergencies may be in places ‘where people cannot afford to move, rather than the places to which they do move’ (GECHS, 2008, p. 24). Secondly, migration is too complex a process to label simply as environmental or climate-induced (Dun and Gemenne, 2008; Morrissey, 2008, p. 28). For example, studying the impact of desertification on migration patterns in the northeastern Ethiopian highlands, Morrissey (2008) found that people’s decisions on whether to migrate or not were mediated by both structural and individual factors. These included the potential for livelihood diversification within rural areas as well as whether or not one had real opportunities and connections in urban areas. In addition, the high degree to which ethnicity has been politicised in the country limits migration options. His research shows the impossibility of providing a grand narrative, or simplistic model, of environmentally induced migration in which farmers experiencing adverse environmental change migrate out of those areas (and livelihoods) affected by environmental deterioration (p. 29). Even on islands and atolls threatened by sea-level rise, decisions to migrate can entail many more factors than climate change alone. A study of the small Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Tuvalu found that socio-economic pressures resulting from lack of employment and development opportunities as well as other kinds of environmental changes are the main drivers of out-migration. The role of climate change needs to be viewed together with these processes (McAdam and Loughry, 2009). A third area of concern is how the label ‘climate refugee,’ like ‘environmental refugee’ before it, could further undermine the rights and protections of traditional refugees as defined by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention (UNHCR, 1951/1967). According to the Convention, a refugee is someone who ‘owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion and nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside his country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. . .’ (UNHCR, 1951/1967). At the same time that it has become popular to apply the label refugee to any group of forced migrants, immigration enforcement agencies, especially in Europe, have fractioned the traditional refugee category by creating a bureaucratic hierarchy of asylum seeker eligibility in order to restrict admission (Zetter, 2007). It is against this politicised background that one must view the evolution of the term ‘climate refugee.’ Both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) caution against using either the term environmental refugee or climate refugee since they have no basis in international refugee law and could undermine the international legal regime for the protection of refugees (UNHCR, 2008; IOM, 2009). UNHCR further emphasises that much displacement due to climate-related factors is likely to be internal in nature, without the crossing of international borders. A more appropriate legal regime for climate-related migration may be human rights law (McAdam and Saul, 2008). Given their analytical flaws and lack of supporting evidence, why have these narratives gained so much momentum? Part of the reason lies in the ways they draw on deep-seated fears and stereotypes of the dark-skinned, over-breeding, dangerous poor (Hartmann, 2009). For example, a June 2009 ABC prime time television documentary on climate change, Earth 2100, scared the viewers with scenes of future apocalypse in which starving Africans take to arms against the West, desperate Mexicans storm the American border, and half the world population dies of a new plague so that humans can get back into balance with nature again. In policy circles, the persistence of these narratives is tied to their usefulness to a variety of interests. Critical literature on policy narratives illustrates the importance of population ‘crisis narratives’ in justifying certain kinds of Western development interventions— particularly the spread of commercial agriculture and forestry at the expense of peasant livelihoods—in Africa and elsewhere (Roe, 1995). A similar phenomenon is witnessed for climate narratives. For example, a 2008 report titled A Climate of Conflict argued that climate change would likely compound the propensity for violent conflict in 46 poor countries and political instability in another 56 (Smith and Vivekananda, 2008). Much of the authors’ analysis is based on old assumptions about the relationship between environmental scarcity and violence. They propose a solution in which international agencies invest in sustainable development, climate change adaptation measures and peace-building activities. There is also a role for multinational corporations. In this winwin world, the rich help the poor, and are largely absolved of responsibility for resource degradation and extraction, as well as political violence. It is as if the scramble for oil, minerals and land in Africa is of little consequence. However, it is also important to note that climate refugee and conflict narratives are sometimes deployed strategically by actors demanding that Western states take seriously their obligations to curb carbon emissions and provide adaptation assistance to affected communities. For example, in May 2009, twelve Pacific Island states brought a resolution to the UN General Assembly linking climate change to political instability in an attempt to get the Security Council to address their plight (MacFarquar, 2009). But even the best of intentions cannot obscure that we do not live in a win-win world, and that spinning climate change as a security threat is likely to undermine, rather than strengthen, serious efforts to link climate change mitigation and adaptation to development efforts that reduce poverty and promote equity. Playing with fear is like playing with fire. You cannot be sure exactly where it will spread. In the current moment, crisis narratives about climate refugees and conflict serve the interests of national security actors. The next section looks at the United States as a case study of how these narratives threaten to blur the line between development and military assistance, especially in Africa.",summarize the following text: ,"climate refugee and conflict narratives seem very much like old wine in a new bottle.

In face of these environmental threats, people feel they have no alternative but to seek sustenance elsewhere, whether within their own countries or beyond and whether on a semi-permanent or permanent basis. (Myers, 1995, pp. 18–19) In many cases, Myers wrote, environmental refugees are actually ‘population pressure’ refugees (p. 63). The report made the statistical claim that there were at least 25 million environmental refugees in the world, compared with 22 million refugees of ‘traditional kind’ (p. 1). Despite the fact that the 25 million figure was arrived at more by conjecture than scientific method,1 it began to circulate widely in the international policy arena (Saunders, 2000; Nordas and Gleditsch, 2007). Now Myers claims there will be 200 million climate migrants by 2050, a figure which is similarly making the rounds in policy documents even though Myers himself acknowledges that the estimate is based on ‘heroic extrapolations’ (Brown, 2008, p. 8). In addition to unreliable statistics, the ‘environmental refugee’ concept has a number of shortcomings. It naturalises the economic and political causes of environmental degradation and masks the role of institutional responses to it. Should people forced to leave their homelands because of the development of a large dam, mine tailings, petroleum pollution or flooding caused by illegal logging all be categorised together as ‘environmental refugees’? In the case of extreme natural events such as droughts, storms and floods, whether or not people are forced to migrate permanently from their homes usually depends on pre-existing social relations (who is most vulnerable) and post-disaster responses (what kind of aid/relief is provided and who receives it). (Wisner et al., 2004). Rooted as it is in neo-Malthusian thinking, the concept of ‘environmental refugee’ overemphasises the role of demographic pressures in migration. The causes of migration are extremely complex and context-specific, and moreover, there is little evidence to support the view that demographic pressure is at the root of many population movements (Suhrke, 1997). In addition, negative neo-Malthusian narratives of migration obscure the positive roles migration can play in improving people’s livelihoods and diminishing vulnerability to environmental change. Often, migration from rural areas is not a linear phenomenon or a rejection of rural livelihoods, but is instead a vital part of sustaining them (Black, 1998). Despite such shortcomings, the environmental refugee concept was deployed by a variety of political actors. Sustainable development advocates found it useful to focus policy attention on environmental degradation issues (Black, 1998) and it also appealed to Western interests in favour of more rigid immigration controls, including limiting the grounds for political asylum. Kibreab argues that the term was invented in part to ‘depoliticise the causes of displacement’ so that states would not have the obligation to provide asylum (Kibreab, 1997, p. 21, cited in Saunders, 2000, p. 240). As the concept gained favour, environmental refugees were increasingly portrayed as a security threat, even though there was little serious research to substantiate the claim (Black, 1998). In the 1990s, political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon propelled the degradation narrative and its negative depiction of migration into the ‘high politics’ of national security. Homer-Dixon’s (1999) environmental conflict model maintains that scarcities of renewable resources such as cropland, fresh water, and forests, induced in large part by population growth, contribute to migration and violent intrastate conflict in many parts of the developing world. In his own words: Population growth and unequal access to good land force huge numbers of people onto marginal lands. There, they cause environmental damage and become chronically poor. Eventually, they may be the source of persistent upheaval, or they may migrate yet again, helping to stimulate ethnic conflicts or urban unrest elsewhere (Homer-Dixon, 1999, p. 155). This conflict, in turn, can potentially disrupt international security as states fragment or become more authoritarian (for a critique of his model, see Hartmann, 2001). Homer-Dixon’s work had a major influence in Washington, DC policy circles particularly in the early years of the Clinton administration when Al Gore championed the environment as a cause. Its legacy persists today in the climate change arena where degradation narratives again link environmental change to violent conflict. UNEP’s report on Sudan, for example, draws on Homer-Dixon’s model and related research to make claims that overpopulation of both people and livestock, coupled with environmental stresses such as water shortages related to climate change, are at the root of conflict in the region (UNEP, 2007). Atlantic Monthly journalist Stephan Faris similarly argues that the real fault lines in Darfur are between ‘settled farmers and nomadic herders fighting over failing lands.’ And he attributes the failure of those lands primarily to climate changeinduced reductions in rainfall. ‘With countries across the region and around the world suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos’ (Faris, 2007). The narrative ignores basic elements of Sudanese political economy that helped create and sustain the conflict. These include gross inequalities in wealth and power between the elite in the capital and the rural population; government agricultural policies that favour large mechanised farms and irrigation schemes over rain-fed, small farmer agriculture, causing both political grievances and land degradation; forced migration, such as the 1990s removal of Nuba farmers from their lands into so-called ‘peace villages’ where they became a source of captive labour for mechanised farms; and what Alex de Waal calls ‘militarised tribalism’ (deWaal, 2007). In particular, the nationalisation of land in 1970, by which customary laws were set aside and people could obtain access only through lease agreements with the government, set the stage for widespread land-grabbing by elites and the marginalisation of pastoralists. As one scholar of the region notes, ‘. . .not all resource conflicts are based on a situation of resource scarcity; rather, they are political in nature and have to do with the workings of the Sudanese state’ (Manger, 2005, p. 135). The discovery of a vast underground aquifer underneath Northern Darfur is not likely to diffuse the crisis, but rather to heighten it, if the government controls the water for its own interests (Polgreen, 2007). The construction of Darfur as a climate conflict should serve as canary in the coal mine that something is amiss when environmental determinism overrides serious analysis of power relations. This is not to deny that environmental changes due to global warming could in some instances exacerbate already existing economic and political divisions. However, whether or not violent conflict and mass migrations result depends on so many other factors that it is far too simplistic to see climate change as a major cause or trigger. Moreover, such threat scenarios ignore the way many poorly resourced communities manage their affairs without recourse to violence. Brown et al. (2007) cite the case of the semi-arid regions of Northern Nigeria where conflicts between pastoralists and agricultural communities occur over water and fodder, but seldom spread because of the existence of traditional conflict resolution institutions. They argue that helping these communities adapt to climate change should involve strengthening such institutions. Research in the drylands of Marsabit District in Northern Kenya found that, in times of drought and water scarcity, there was actually less violence, not more (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007). Poor herdsmen were not inclined to start fights during droughts, and despite poverty and population growth in the region, strong but flexible common property regimes governing water helped people adjust to its scarcity. ‘If at any time a conflict over a scarce natural resource like water exists,’ the authors write, ‘it can be a sign that local resource users themselves have been made powerless and that their negotiating system has been paralysed, either by external agencies or local elites’ (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007, p. 235). A study done in northern Senegal from 1998–2002 concluded that drought-related migration led pastoralists to develop better strategies to manage herds and also had positive repercussions on the communities where they settled due to expansion of agriculture and trade (Juul, 2005). In fact, there is a rich body of empirical case studies of African agriculture, pastoralism and forestry that challenges conventional neo-Malthusian narratives about population, scarcity and conflict (e.g. Leach and Mearns, 1996; Gausset et al., 2005; Derman et al., 2007). Yet it is hardly ever cited in the environmental conflict or climate conflict literature. A certain exceptionalism is at work—while it is commonly assumed that scarcity can lead to institutional and technological innovation in more affluent countries, just the opposite is assumed for poor people in less affluent countries. Scarcity renders them into victims/ villains, incapable of innovation or livelihood diversification and naturally prone to violence. Also neglected in the climate conflict literature is scholarship that connects violent conflict in Africa more closely to resource abundance (e.g. rich oil and mineral reserves, valuable timber and diamonds) than resource scarcity (e.g. Fairhead, 2001). Today, critiques of ‘climate conflict’ are emerging. For example, regarding the implications of climate change for armed conflict, Buhaug et al. (2008) note the difficulty of coming up with any generalisable model since increased likelihood of organised violence ‘depends crucially on country-specific and contextual factors’ (p. 2). The report concludes that alarm about climate conflict is not based on substantive evidence. The term ‘climate refugees’ is also coming under increased scrutiny on a number of grounds. First, while climate change is likely to cause displacement, the extent of that displacement will not only depend on how much the temperature rises and affects sealevels, rainfall patterns and extreme weather, but also on the existence and effectiveness of adaptation measures that help individuals and communities cope with environmental stresses. Whether or not such measures are in place in turn depends on political economies at the local, regional, national and international levels that are often conveniently left out of the discussion of so-called ‘climate refugees.’ As one report points out, larger climaterelated humanitarian emergencies may be in places ‘where people cannot afford to move, rather than the places to which they do move’ (GECHS, 2008, p. 24). Secondly, migration is too complex a process to label simply as environmental or climate-induced (Dun and Gemenne, 2008; Morrissey, 2008, p. 28). For example, studying the impact of desertification on migration patterns in the northeastern Ethiopian highlands, Morrissey (2008) found that people’s decisions on whether to migrate or not were mediated by both structural and individual factors. These included the potential for livelihood diversification within rural areas as well as whether or not one had real opportunities and connections in urban areas. In addition, the high degree to which ethnicity has been politicised in the country limits migration options. His research shows the impossibility of providing a grand narrative, or simplistic model, of environmentally induced migration in which farmers experiencing adverse environmental change migrate out of those areas (and livelihoods) affected by environmental deterioration (p. 29). Even on islands and atolls threatened by sea-level rise, decisions to migrate can entail many more factors than climate change alone. A study of the small Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Tuvalu found that socio-economic pressures resulting from lack of employment and development opportunities as well as other kinds of environmental changes are the main drivers of out-migration. The role of climate change needs to be viewed together with these processes (McAdam and Loughry, 2009). A third area of concern is how the label ‘climate refugee,’ like ‘environmental refugee’ before it, could further undermine the rights and protections of traditional refugees as defined by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention (UNHCR, 1951/1967). According to the Convention, a refugee is someone who ‘owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion and nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside his country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. . .’ (UNHCR, 1951/1967). At the same time that it has become popular to apply the label refugee to any group of forced migrants, immigration enforcement agencies, especially in Europe, have fractioned the traditional refugee category by creating a bureaucratic hierarchy of asylum seeker eligibility in order to restrict admission (Zetter, 2007). It is against this politicised background that one must view the evolution of the term ‘climate refugee.’ Both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) caution against using either the term environmental refugee or climate refugee since they have no basis in international refugee law and could undermine the international legal regime for the protection of refugees (UNHCR, 2008; IOM, 2009). UNHCR further emphasises that much displacement due to climate-related factors is likely to be internal in nature, without the crossing of international borders. A more appropriate legal regime for climate-related migration may be human rights law (McAdam and Saul, 2008). Given their analytical flaws and lack of supporting evidence, why have these narratives gained so much momentum? Part of the reason lies in the ways they draw on deep-seated fears and stereotypes of the dark-skinned, over-breeding, dangerous poor (Hartmann, 2009). For example, a June 2009 ABC prime time television documentary on climate change, Earth 2100, scared the viewers with scenes of future apocalypse in which starving Africans take to arms against the West, desperate Mexicans storm the American border, and half the world population dies of a new plague so that humans can get back into balance with nature again. In policy circles, the persistence of these narratives is tied to their usefulness to a variety of interests. Critical literature on policy narratives illustrates the importance of population ‘crisis narratives’ in justifying certain kinds of Western development interventions— particularly the spread of commercial agriculture and forestry at the expense of peasant livelihoods—in Africa and elsewhere (Roe, 1995). A similar phenomenon is witnessed for climate narratives. For example, a 2008 report titled A Climate of Conflict argued that climate change would likely compound the propensity for violent conflict in 46 poor countries and political instability in another 56 (Smith and Vivekananda, 2008). Much of the authors’ analysis is based on old assumptions about the relationship between environmental scarcity and violence. They propose a solution in which international agencies invest in sustainable development, climate change adaptation measures and peace-building activities. There is also a role for multinational corporations. In this winwin world, the rich help the poor, and are largely absolved of responsibility for resource degradation and extraction, as well as political violence. It is as if the scramble for oil, minerals and land in Africa is of little consequence. However, it is also important to note that climate refugee and conflict narratives are sometimes deployed strategically by actors demanding that Western states take seriously their obligations to curb carbon emissions and provide adaptation assistance to affected communities. For example, in May 2009, twelve Pacific Island states brought a resolution to the UN General Assembly linking climate change to political instability in an attempt to get the Security Council to address their plight (MacFarquar, 2009). But even the best of intentions cannot obscure that we do not live in a win-win world, and that spinning climate change as a security threat is likely to undermine, rather than strengthen, serious efforts to link climate change mitigation and adaptation to development efforts that reduce poverty and promote equity. Playing with fear is like playing with fire. You cannot be sure exactly where it will spread. In the current moment, crisis narratives about climate refugees and conflict serve the interests of national security actors. The next section looks at the United States as a case study of how these narratives threaten to blur the line between development and military assistance, especially in Africa.",summarize the following text: ,"climate refugee and conflict narratives seem very much like old wine in a new bottle. The vintage goes back even further  to a degradation narrative Drawing on old colonial stereotypes of destructive Third World peasants and herders, the degradation narrative has proved particularly popular in Western policy circles because it kills a number of birds with one stone: it blames poverty on population pressure, and not, on lack of land reform or off-farm employment opportunities; it blames peasants for land degradation, obscuring the role of commercial agriculture and extractive industries and it targets migration both as an environmental and security threat  concern began to mount about the dangers posed by so-called ‘environmental refugees’.

"The green paradox refers to an outcome in which climate policies such as carbon taxes, which are aimed at reducing carbon emissions, instead have the opposite effect: emissions increase, at least for some period of time. The recent debate about the green paradox was initially triggered by Sinn (2008), who focused on one specific reason for this paradoxical outcome: the effect of climate policies on the long-run profits (more specifically, scarcity rents) that owners of fossil resources expect to earn from selling their resources over time. More recently, the term green paradox has been used to more broadly describe unintended consequences of climate policies.
For economists, the solution to environmental problems like climate change is a Pigovian tax (i.e., a tax that is equal to the social marginal damage from emissions) or an equivalent policy. However, for political reasons, it is likely that a carbon tax will not be set according to the Pigovian principle but rather will start low and then rise over time. A green paradox arises if this policy backfires and the environmental problem worsens. The culprit here is the reaction on the supply side of the fossil fuel market. Because fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, their prices reflect not only the cost of production but also their scarcity. Thus, owners of fossil fuels enjoy scarcity rents and maximize their profits by deciding when to extract their coal, oil, or gas reserves. If a future tightening of climate policy threatens to decrease future scarcity rents, then to maximize profits, fossil fuel owners will decide to extract less in the future and extract more today instead. This forward shift in extraction is known as the weak green paradox. If, despite climate policy, resource owners can still extract almost all of their resources profitably, then the forward shift in extraction might actually increase cumulative damages—an outcome known as a strong green paradox.
Trump decks solvency
Roberts and Plumer, 11/14/2016 – reporter at Vox, citing David Victor, an expert on global climate policy at University of California, San Diego, explains how here. (David and Brad, “Most people are wildly underestimating what Trump’s win will mean for the environment”, Vox, http://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/11/14/13582562/trump-gop-climate-environmental-policy)//spencer
Unified Republican control of the federal government over the next two years augurs a sea change in US environmental policy like nothing since the late 1960s and ’70s, when America’s landmark environmental laws were first passed. If Donald Trump and the GOP actually follow through on what they’ve promised, this time around will be a lurch in the opposite direction. Federal climate policy will all but disappear; participation in international environmental or climate treaties will end; pollution regulations will be reversed, frozen in place, or not enforced; clean energy research, development, and deployment assistance will decline; protections for sensitive areas and ecosystems will be lifted; federal leasing of fossil fuels will expand and accelerate; new Supreme Court appointees will crack down on EPA discretion. Some of these moves will be easy for Trump and Republicans in Congress to pull off. Others will be harder: Senate Democrats and environmental groups in court will fight them tooth and nail, as they did during the Reagan and Bush years. But there’s no escaping the fact that the GOP is in a strong position to demolish and reshape the regime of environmental protection that has been built up over the past 50 years. Never mind Trump — the GOP Congress has a radical environmental agenda ready to go Donald Trump’s promise to dismantle President Obama’s climate regulations have gotten plenty of attention. But it is only the tip of the iceberg, a fraction of what Republicans in Congress have been pushing for over the years. Obama has amassed a considerable record on green policy. His agencies have implemented a range of new standards and regulations on everything from appliances to cars to power plants, and he has stimulated the growth of several clean energy industries with loans and grants. The GOP wants to undo all that. But it wants much more as well. Few people understand just how radical the GOP environmental agenda is, but it’s not a secret. While Obama has been in office, Republicans in Congress have floated myriad budget bills that reveal their legislative priorities. Many of those bills were blocked by the Senate or White House, so they rarely got attention. You can see a partial list of past House Republican bills here. In 2013, they proposed cutting EPA funding by fully one-third. GOP committees churned out bill after bill to cut research funding for renewable energy by 50 percent, block rules on coal pollution, block rules on oil spills, block rules on pesticide spraying, accelerate oil and gas drilling permits on public land, prohibit funding for creation or expansion of wildlife refuges, cut funding for the Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program, and ... well, there are 61 items on the list. The Senate GOP isn’t far behind: In 2015, they floated a bill to cut the EPA’s budget by 9 percent and block rules on everything from ground-level ozone pollution to climate change. There may be a few more moderate GOP senators who think global warming is a problem, like Susan Collins (R-ME). But they do not dominate the caucus: Fossil-fuel enthusiasts like Mitch McConnell and James Inhofe do. There’s no indication that Trump will buck his party on these issues. His ignorance on policy is near total and he’s shown no desire or willingness to learn anything about it. So in practice, environmental policy under Trump is likely to be run by the GOP apparatus — Republican leaders in Congress and the industry-friendly figures he appoints to his administration. He’s already tapped climate denier Myron Ebell to lead the transition at EPA and is considering Sarah Palin (yes, really) to head the Department of the Interior. There’s little reason to think that Trump’s environmental and climate policy will be some unpredictable, idiosyncratic anomaly like Trump himself. It will likely be standard, mainstream GOP policy, which is far more radical than anything he campaigned on. The biggest thing slowing the GOP right now is the Senate filibuster It won’t be easy for the Trump administration to roll back many of the EPA’s existing regulations on its own. As Jody Freeman, an Obama administration veteran, explains in detail here, rewriting existing regulations through the executive branch is an arduous process, one that’s almost certain to get bogged down in court by green groups skilled at litigation. Similar lawsuits ultimately stymied George W. Bush in the 2000s, and he only managed to rescind a fraction of Bill Clinton’s environmental rules. So the biggest question is whether Republicans in Congress can revamp the laws that underpin and guide the EPA. And here, the only thing stopping them is the Senate. There will be 47 Democrats in the Senate in 2017. If 40 of them can stick together, they can filibuster Republican environmental legislation. (Ending a filibuster requires a cloture vote by a supermajority of 60 senators.) Will Republican leaders let that happen? Or will they get rid of the filibuster? They would need only 50 votes to do so. Jonathan Chait thinks the filibuster is toast. Jonathan Bernstein thinks there’s a chance it could survive, since there are some old-school institutionalists on the right, like Jeff Flake and John McCain, who prefer to keep it. If the filibuster survives, Republicans will be significantly constrained in what they can do, though they still have options. They could, for instance, try to slip environmental measures that affect the federal budget into budget reconciliation bills — those only need 51 votes to pass. (Paul Ryan suggested that strategy in a presser in January.) Here are 11 top environmental priorities for Trump and a GOP Congress 1) Kill Obama’s Clean Power Plan The GOP is nearly united in its hatred of Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan. There’s only one Republican senator left, Susan Collins of Maine, who has ever defended it. Killing or degrading the CPP will be a top priority. In 2007’s Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court ruled that greenhouse gases could, if judged dangerous to human health or welfare, be considered pollutants subject to the Clean Air Act. Shortly thereafter, EPA’s scientists judged them dangerous to both. That means EPA must, by law, act to reduce greenhouse gases. The Obama administration followed through on this by enacting fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks (see below). It also set up the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. The simplest way for the GOP to destroy the CPP would be to take away the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases at all. It’s a simple bill: “The Clean Air Act shall not apply to greenhouse gases.” The CPP would be nuked, and no president could ever again try to do what Obama did. (The House passed just such a bill in 2011.) If Senate Democrats can filibuster this measure — and this is likely to be a central fight — then the Trump administration would have to resort to other executive branch strategies to weaken the rule. It could refuse to defend it in court. It could deny EPA the funds necessary to enforce it. It could start another round of rulemaking to substantially weaken it. Those moves would inevitably prompt lawsuits, but those lawsuits would drag on for years and years. One way or another, the CPP is in the crosshairs. 2) Withdraw from the Paris climate agreement Back in 2015, the world’s countries got together in Paris and agreed to a landmark climate deal. Every country would voluntarily pledge to restrain its greenhouse gas emissions and meet regularly at the United Nations to ratchet up ambitions over time — all in the hopes of keeping global warming below the “dangerous” level of 2°C. Now Trump plans to pull the United States out of the deal. His advisers are debating precisely how to do this, but there’s little stopping them. Trump can refuse to follow through on Obama’s pledge of cutting emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. He can refuse to attend UN meetings, or refuse to chip in promised funds to help poor countries decarbonize. The real question is how other countries will react. For now, the Chinese government is warning Trump not to blow up the deal and insisting that China will lead global efforts to curtail emissions in America’s absence. Still, there’s a real risk that other countries could lose interest in climate policy if the world’s wealthiest superpower bows out. David Victor, an expert on global climate policy at University of California, San Diego, explains how here. Even under Paris, the world was struggling to stay below the 2°C global warming mark and had little margin for error. Now, with Trump’s recalcitrance, that goal has likely drifted out of reach. 3
The plan’s restriction is circumvented --- industry will ignore, buy off or evade environmental enforcement
Biron 14 – Editor, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (Carey, “Why Corporations Breaking Environmental Laws Are Getting A Free Pass,” http://www.occupy.com/article/why-corporations-breaking-environmental-laws-are-getting-free-pass#sthash.k5kMl7e9.dpuf)
While U.S. regulators are actively flagging and tracking corporate violations of federal environmental laws, the government is rarely pursuing criminal penalties for those infractions. The Environmental Protection Agency, the key department in safeguarding the country’s health from pollutants, pursues criminal charges in fewer than one-half of one percent of total violations, according to new research. Both the EPA and the Department of Justice do continue to score high-visibility accountability successes for environmental crimes every year, but most of these are civil charges, which require less evidence to prove and fewer resources to prosecute. Yet critics worry that civil proceedings, which typically result in fines but no jail time or restitution, don’t offer the robust deterrent effect necessary to substantively impact corporate decision-making or offer compensation to affected communities. “More than 64,000 facilities are currently listed in agency databases as being in violation of federal environmental laws, but in most years, fewer than one-half of one percent of violations trigger criminal investigations,” according to a new investigation from the Crime Report, a publication of the Center on Media, Crime and Justice at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. The study notes that some of the country’s broadest and most powerful environmental laws, including the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, provide the EPA with the authority to decide whether legal violations should be dealt with through criminal or civil means. But the vast majority of the time, prosecutors appear to be choosing to pursue civil charges. “[T]his means most corporate violators can avoid criminal prosecution,” Crime Report deputy managing editor Graham Kates writes in the study, citing eight months of investigation. “As a result, the vast majority of corporate environmental transgressions – even cases that involve the releases of large amounts of toxic chemicals – are relegated to civil and administrative enforcement.” Further, according to data provided in the investigation, the number of criminal cases launched by the EPA has dropped in recent years. The report suggests that the agency’s Criminal Investigation Division carried out more than 475 criminal investigations in 2001, compared to less than 300 last year. The Department of Justice, meanwhile, engaged in far fewer. The department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division concluded just 53 criminal cases in fiscal year 2013, according to a formal report released in April. Kates says the findings underline “the anomalies of a system that has allowed the vast majority of corporate environmental lawbreakers to escape prosecution.” Stacked Framework The EPA disagrees with the findings, noting in an email to MintPress News that the “allegations do not square with the facts.” The past fiscal year, an agency spokesperson noted, constituted “the strongest year in criminal sentencing” since 2005. “In Fiscal Year 2013, EPA’s criminal cases assessed more than $1.5 billion in criminal fines and restitution, and more than $3 billion in court-ordered environmental projects to benefit communities, the largest amounts ever for a single year,” the spokesperson stated. “We charged 281 defendants and recorded 161 years of incarceration … Big cases like the Deepwater Horizon disaster and Walmart’s [sic] illegal handling of pesticides and hazardous waste resulted in nationwide reforms and billions of dollars to help affected communities.” The BP and Wal-Mart cases were two of the highest-visibility cases that the EPA concluded last year, and overall, the agency racked up some $5.6 billion in criminal and civil penalties. Most of that significant sum came from just one case: the BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which resulted in some $3.7 billion. (An agency compilation of its biggest criminal cases from 2013 can be found here, while a full report from the year can be found here.) Indeed, the problem is not one of regulators purposefully letting corporate entities off the hook. Rather, the concerns underscored in the new figures point to a systemic problem in which meaningful preventative mechanisms for environmental crime appear to have weakened significantly over the past decade or more. The Department of Justice, for instance, has focused significantly more attention on terrorism cases since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, while decreasing its attention to white-collar crime in general, analysts tell MintPress. The mammoth BP case notwithstanding, “The trends in enforcement against oil and gas industry violations, whether civil or criminal, whether in state or federal arenas, are down,” Bruce Baizel, energy program director at Earthworks, a legal advocacy group, told MintPress. “The environmental framework is stacked against robust enforcement, even where the industry knowingly violates the law. They know it is unlikely they will be caught; if caught, they are unlikely to be charged; and if charged, they can work the system to avoid penalties.” Chronic Violations U.S. regulators have also come under scrutiny for failing to take advantage of the full range of punitive measures available to them. In the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon crisis, for instance, the EPA rescinded BP’s eligibility for lucrative U.S. government contracts. Yet in March those restrictions were lifted, just in time for the company to bid on new oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. “The question of adequate sanctions is an important one, and debarment is a sanction that’s underutilized — not just for environmental crimes but for violations across the board,” Charlie Cray, a researcher with Greenpeace USA, a watchdog group, told MintPress. “Any company found in criminal violation for environmental crimes can and should be not only prosecuted but also sanctioned to the full extent possible, in a way that meaningfully incentivizes changes to prevent something similar in the future. If the sanctions were tough enough, companies would be proactive in preventing violations from repeating.” It is the serial nature of much of the environmental crime in the United States that lies at the heart of advocates’ concern around the lack of criminal prosecutions for these violations. The Crime Report findings include a full listing of EPA-flagged violations, and a large number of the companies are marked as “SNC” — an indicator, meaning “Significant Noncompliance,” that is often be applied to chronic violators. According to the EPA’senforcement guidelines, criminal cases differ most substantially from civil proceedings in whether prosecutors can prove criminal intent — whether violators knowingly broke the law. Thus, while regulators’ prosecutorial discretion over whether to pursue criminal or civil charges for a first-time crime is a gray area, that decision should be more straightforward when dealing with chronic violators. “The line between civil and criminal prosecution, especially with serial violations, is really a matter of judgment,” says a source who is highly knowledgeable about environmental criminal investigations but who spoke with MintPress on condition of anonymity because he’s no longer in his previous position. “If a violator has repeated violations and there’s significant damage, especially if there’s any cover-up, those are factors that go into the judgment call over whether prosecutors will pursue civil or criminal charges. The fact is that criminal environmental prosecutions have just not been a priority — the Department of Justice is not being as aggressive as it could be.” Regulatory Catch-up Meanwhile, the EPA is laboring under pressing budgetary constraints, having already weathered years’ worth of Republican attempts to undermine the agency’s ability to function. In July, the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee moved to cut some $700 million from the EPA’s budget. The combination of weakened political will and resource constrictions has real consequences, both now and into the future. Already, the EPA’s Criminal Enforcement Division numbers just 200 agents, the Crime Report notes, while the Justice Department’s corollary division has just 38 prosecutors. And according to a five-year strategic plan released in April, the EPA is planning to pare down the scope of its criminal cases to those with “the most significant health, environmental, and deterrence impacts.”",summarize the following text: ,"The green paradox refers to an outcome in which carbon taxes aimed at reducing emissions have the opposite effect: emissions increase on one specific reason for this paradoxical outcome: the effect of climate policies on the long-run profits owners of fossil resources expect to earn from selling their resources over time
For economists, the solution to climate change is a Pigovian tax equal to the social marginal damage However, for political reasons, it is likely that a carbon tax will not be set according to the Pigovian principle but will start low and then rise over time. A green paradox arises if this policy backfires and the environmental problem worsens. The culprit is the reaction on the supply side of the fossil fuel market fossil fuels prices reflect not only cost of production but also scarcity owners of fossil fuels maximize their profits by deciding when to extract If a future tightening of climate policy threatens to decrease future scarcity rents, then to maximize profits, fossil fuel owners will extract less in the future and extract more today instead If, despite climate policy, resource owners can still extract almost all of their resources profitably the forward shift in extraction might increase cumulative damages

Unified Republican control of the federal government over the next two years augurs a sea change in US environmental policy like nothing since the late 1960s and ’70s, when America’s landmark environmental laws were first passed If Donald Trump and the GOP actually follow through on what they’ve promised, this time around will be a lurch in the opposite direction. Federal climate policy will all but disappear; participation in international environmental or climate treaties will end; pollution regulations will be reversed, frozen in place, or not enforced; clean energy research, development, and deployment assistance will decline; protections for sensitive areas and ecosystems will be lifted; federal leasing of fossil fuels will expand and accelerate; new Supreme Court appointees will crack down on EPA discretion Senate Democrats and environmental groups in court will fight them tooth and nail, as they did during the Reagan and Bush years. But there’s no escaping the fact that the GOP is in a strong position to demolish and reshape the regime of environmental protection that has been built up over the past 50 years. the GOP Congress has a radical environmental agenda ready to go Obama has amassed a considerable record on green policy. His agencies have implemented a range of new standards and regulations on everything from appliances to cars to power plants, and he has stimulated the growth of several clean energy industries with loans and grants. The GOP wants to undo all that. But it wants much more as well. Few people understand just how radical the GOP environmental agenda is, but it’s not a secret Trump His ignorance on policy is near total and he’s shown no desire or willingness to learn anything about it. So in practice, environmental policy under Trump is likely to be run by the GOP apparatus — Republican leaders in Congress and the industry-friendly figures he appoints to his administration. He’s already tapped climate denier Myron Ebell to lead the transition at EPA and is considering Sarah Palin (yes, really) to head the Department of the Interior. There’s little reason to think that Trump’s environmental and climate policy will be some unpredictable, idiosyncratic anomaly like Trump himself. It will likely be standard, mainstream GOP policy, which is far more radical than anything he campaigned on. Kill Obama’s Clean Power Plan the Clean Power Plan, which would reduce carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. The simplest way for the GOP to destroy the CPP would be to take away the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases at all Withdraw from the Paris climate agreement Back in 2015, the world’s countries got together in Paris and agreed to a landmark climate deal. Every country would voluntarily pledge to restrain its greenhouse gas emissions and meet regularly at the United Nations to ratchet up ambitions over time — all in the hopes of keeping global warming below the “dangerous” level of 2°C. Now Trump plans to pull the United States out of the deal. His advisers are debating precisely how to do this, but there’s little stopping them. Trump can refuse to follow through on Obama’s pledge of cutting emissions 26 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. He can refuse to attend UN meetings, or refuse to chip in promised funds to help poor countries decarbonize. there’s a real risk that other countries could lose interest in climate policy if the world’s wealthiest superpower bows out. David Victor, an expert on global climate policy at University of California, San Diego, explains how here. Even under Paris, the world was struggling to stay below the 2°C global warming mark and had little margin for error. Now, with Trump’s recalcitrance, that goal has  drifted out of reach.
While regulators are flagging corporate violations of federal environmental laws, the government is rarely pursuing criminal penalties for those infractions The Environmental Protection Agency, the key department in safeguarding the country’s health from pollutants, pursues criminal charges in fewer than one-half of one percent of total violations Both the EPA and the Department of Justice do continue to score civil charges civil proceedings, which typically result in fines but no jail time or restitution, don’t offer the robust deterrent effect necessary to substantively impact corporate decision-making or offer compensation to affected communities More than 64,000 facilities are currently listed in agency databases as being in violation of federal environmental laws, but fewer than one-half of one percent of violations trigger criminal investigations meaningful preventative mechanisms for environmental crime appear to have weakened significantly over the past decade The Department of Justice, has focused significantly more attention on terrorism The trends in enforcement against oil and gas industry violations are down The environmental framework is stacked against robust enforcement, even where the industry knowingly violates the law.

For those familiar with the environmental security field, particularly neo-Malthusian models of environmental conflict developed in the 1980s and 1990s, climate refugee and conflict narratives seem very much like old wine in a new bottle. The vintage goes back even further, however, to a powerful policy narrative that I call the ‘degradation narrative’ (Hartmann and Hendrixson, 2005; Hartmann, 2006). Drawing on old colonial stereotypes of destructive Third World peasants and herders, degradation narratives go something like this: population-pressure induced poverty makes Third World peasants degrade their environments by over-farming or over-grazing marginal lands. The ensuing soil depletion and desertification then lead them to migrate elsewhere as ‘environmental refugees’, either to other ecologically vulnerable rural areas where the vicious cycle is once again set in motion or to cities where they strain scarce resources and become a primary source of political instability. Despite salient critiques by international development scholars and practitioners (for example, Boserup, 1965; Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987; Williams, 1995; Leach and Mearns, 1996; Thompson, 2000), the degradation narrative has proved particularly popular in Western policy circles because it kills a number of birds with one stone: it blames poverty on population pressure, and not, for example, on lack of land reform or off-farm employment opportunities; it blames peasants for land degradation, obscuring the role of commercial agriculture and extractive industries and it targets migration both as an environmental and security threat. With the waning of the Cold War, growing interest in sustainable development and alternative visions of security increased the authority of the degradation narrative. In particular, concern began to mount about the dangers posed by so-called ‘environmental refugees’. Central to the concept is the assumption that population pressure is one of the main precipitating causes of environmental degradation and resulting migration (Saunders, 2000). Myers (1995) further popularised and legitimised the concept of environmental refugees offering a working definition: Environmental refugees are persons who can no longer gain a secure livelihood in their traditional homelands because of environmental factors of unusual scope, notably drought, desertification, deforestation, soil erosion, water shortages and climate change [my emphasis], also natural disaster such as cyclones, storm surges and floods. In face of these environmental threats, people feel they have no alternative but to seek sustenance elsewhere, whether within their own countries or beyond and whether on a semi-permanent or permanent basis. (Myers, 1995, pp. 18–19) In many cases, Myers wrote, environmental refugees are actually ‘population pressure’ refugees (p. 63). The report made the statistical claim that there were at least 25 million environmental refugees in the world, compared with 22 million refugees of ‘traditional kind’ (p. 1). Despite the fact that the 25 million figure was arrived at more by conjecture than scientific method,1 it began to circulate widely in the international policy arena (Saunders, 2000; Nordas and Gleditsch, 2007). Now Myers claims there will be 200 million climate migrants by 2050, a figure which is similarly making the rounds in policy documents even though Myers himself acknowledges that the estimate is based on ‘heroic extrapolations’ (Brown, 2008, p. 8). In addition to unreliable statistics, the ‘environmental refugee’ concept has a number of shortcomings. It naturalises the economic and political causes of environmental degradation and masks the role of institutional responses to it. Should people forced to leave their homelands because of the development of a large dam, mine tailings, petroleum pollution or flooding caused by illegal logging all be categorised together as ‘environmental refugees’? In the case of extreme natural events such as droughts, storms and floods, whether or not people are forced to migrate permanently from their homes usually depends on pre-existing social relations (who is most vulnerable) and post-disaster responses (what kind of aid/relief is provided and who receives it). (Wisner et al., 2004). Rooted as it is in neo-Malthusian thinking, the concept of ‘environmental refugee’ overemphasises the role of demographic pressures in migration. The causes of migration are extremely complex and context-specific, and moreover, there is little evidence to support the view that demographic pressure is at the root of many population movements (Suhrke, 1997). In addition, negative neo-Malthusian narratives of migration obscure the positive roles migration can play in improving people’s livelihoods and diminishing vulnerability to environmental change. Often, migration from rural areas is not a linear phenomenon or a rejection of rural livelihoods, but is instead a vital part of sustaining them (Black, 1998). Despite such shortcomings, the environmental refugee concept was deployed by a variety of political actors. Sustainable development advocates found it useful to focus policy attention on environmental degradation issues (Black, 1998) and it also appealed to Western interests in favour of more rigid immigration controls, including limiting the grounds for political asylum. Kibreab argues that the term was invented in part to ‘depoliticise the causes of displacement’ so that states would not have the obligation to provide asylum (Kibreab, 1997, p. 21, cited in Saunders, 2000, p. 240). As the concept gained favour, environmental refugees were increasingly portrayed as a security threat, even though there was little serious research to substantiate the claim (Black, 1998). In the 1990s, political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon propelled the degradation narrative and its negative depiction of migration into the ‘high politics’ of national security. Homer-Dixon’s (1999) environmental conflict model maintains that scarcities of renewable resources such as cropland, fresh water, and forests, induced in large part by population growth, contribute to migration and violent intrastate conflict in many parts of the developing world. In his own words: Population growth and unequal access to good land force huge numbers of people onto marginal lands. There, they cause environmental damage and become chronically poor. Eventually, they may be the source of persistent upheaval, or they may migrate yet again, helping to stimulate ethnic conflicts or urban unrest elsewhere (Homer-Dixon, 1999, p. 155). This conflict, in turn, can potentially disrupt international security as states fragment or become more authoritarian (for a critique of his model, see Hartmann, 2001). Homer-Dixon’s work had a major influence in Washington, DC policy circles particularly in the early years of the Clinton administration when Al Gore championed the environment as a cause. Its legacy persists today in the climate change arena where degradation narratives again link environmental change to violent conflict. UNEP’s report on Sudan, for example, draws on Homer-Dixon’s model and related research to make claims that overpopulation of both people and livestock, coupled with environmental stresses such as water shortages related to climate change, are at the root of conflict in the region (UNEP, 2007). Atlantic Monthly journalist Stephan Faris similarly argues that the real fault lines in Darfur are between ‘settled farmers and nomadic herders fighting over failing lands.’ And he attributes the failure of those lands primarily to climate changeinduced reductions in rainfall. ‘With countries across the region and around the world suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos’ (Faris, 2007). The narrative ignores basic elements of Sudanese political economy that helped create and sustain the conflict. These include gross inequalities in wealth and power between the elite in the capital and the rural population; government agricultural policies that favour large mechanised farms and irrigation schemes over rain-fed, small farmer agriculture, causing both political grievances and land degradation; forced migration, such as the 1990s removal of Nuba farmers from their lands into so-called ‘peace villages’ where they became a source of captive labour for mechanised farms; and what Alex de Waal calls ‘militarised tribalism’ (deWaal, 2007). In particular, the nationalisation of land in 1970, by which customary laws were set aside and people could obtain access only through lease agreements with the government, set the stage for widespread land-grabbing by elites and the marginalisation of pastoralists. As one scholar of the region notes, ‘. . .not all resource conflicts are based on a situation of resource scarcity; rather, they are political in nature and have to do with the workings of the Sudanese state’ (Manger, 2005, p. 135). The discovery of a vast underground aquifer underneath Northern Darfur is not likely to diffuse the crisis, but rather to heighten it, if the government controls the water for its own interests (Polgreen, 2007). The construction of Darfur as a climate conflict should serve as canary in the coal mine that something is amiss when environmental determinism overrides serious analysis of power relations. This is not to deny that environmental changes due to global warming could in some instances exacerbate already existing economic and political divisions. However, whether or not violent conflict and mass migrations result depends on so many other factors that it is far too simplistic to see climate change as a major cause or trigger. Moreover, such threat scenarios ignore the way many poorly resourced communities manage their affairs without recourse to violence. Brown et al. (2007) cite the case of the semi-arid regions of Northern Nigeria where conflicts between pastoralists and agricultural communities occur over water and fodder, but seldom spread because of the existence of traditional conflict resolution institutions. They argue that helping these communities adapt to climate change should involve strengthening such institutions. Research in the drylands of Marsabit District in Northern Kenya found that, in times of drought and water scarcity, there was actually less violence, not more (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007). Poor herdsmen were not inclined to start fights during droughts, and despite poverty and population growth in the region, strong but flexible common property regimes governing water helped people adjust to its scarcity. ‘If at any time a conflict over a scarce natural resource like water exists,’ the authors write, ‘it can be a sign that local resource users themselves have been made powerless and that their negotiating system has been paralysed, either by external agencies or local elites’ (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007, p. 235). A study done in northern Senegal from 1998–2002 concluded that drought-related migration led pastoralists to develop better strategies to manage herds and also had positive repercussions on the communities where they settled due to expansion of agriculture and trade (Juul, 2005). In fact, there is a rich body of empirical case studies of African agriculture, pastoralism and forestry that challenges conventional neo-Malthusian narratives about population, scarcity and conflict (e.g. Leach and Mearns, 1996; Gausset et al., 2005; Derman et al., 2007). Yet it is hardly ever cited in the environmental conflict or climate conflict literature. A certain exceptionalism is at work—while it is commonly assumed that scarcity can lead to institutional and technological innovation in more affluent countries, just the opposite is assumed for poor people in less affluent countries. Scarcity renders them into victims/ villains, incapable of innovation or livelihood diversification and naturally prone to violence. Also neglected in the climate conflict literature is scholarship that connects violent conflict in Africa more closely to resource abundance (e.g. rich oil and mineral reserves, valuable timber and diamonds) than resource scarcity (e.g. Fairhead, 2001). Today, critiques of ‘climate conflict’ are emerging. For example, regarding the implications of climate change for armed conflict, Buhaug et al. (2008) note the difficulty of coming up with any generalisable model since increased likelihood of organised violence ‘depends crucially on country-specific and contextual factors’ (p. 2). The report concludes that alarm about climate conflict is not based on substantive evidence. The term ‘climate refugees’ is also coming under increased scrutiny on a number of grounds. First, while climate change is likely to cause displacement, the extent of that displacement will not only depend on how much the temperature rises and affects sealevels, rainfall patterns and extreme weather, but also on the existence and effectiveness of adaptation measures that help individuals and communities cope with environmental stresses. Whether or not such measures are in place in turn depends on political economies at the local, regional, national and international levels that are often conveniently left out of the discussion of so-called ‘climate refugees.’ As one report points out, larger climaterelated humanitarian emergencies may be in places ‘where people cannot afford to move, rather than the places to which they do move’ (GECHS, 2008, p. 24). Secondly, migration is too complex a process to label simply as environmental or climate-induced (Dun and Gemenne, 2008; Morrissey, 2008, p. 28). For example, studying the impact of desertification on migration patterns in the northeastern Ethiopian highlands, Morrissey (2008) found that people’s decisions on whether to migrate or not were mediated by both structural and individual factors. These included the potential for livelihood diversification within rural areas as well as whether or not one had real opportunities and connections in urban areas. In addition, the high degree to which ethnicity has been politicised in the country limits migration options. His research shows the impossibility of providing a grand narrative, or simplistic model, of environmentally induced migration in which farmers experiencing adverse environmental change migrate out of those areas (and livelihoods) affected by environmental deterioration (p. 29). Even on islands and atolls threatened by sea-level rise, decisions to migrate can entail many more factors than climate change alone. A study of the small Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Tuvalu found that socio-economic pressures resulting from lack of employment and development opportunities as well as other kinds of environmental changes are the main drivers of out-migration. The role of climate change needs to be viewed together with these processes (McAdam and Loughry, 2009). A third area of concern is how the label ‘climate refugee,’ like ‘environmental refugee’ before it, could further undermine the rights and protections of traditional refugees as defined by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention (UNHCR, 1951/1967). According to the Convention, a refugee is someone who ‘owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion and nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside his country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. . .’ (UNHCR, 1951/1967). At the same time that it has become popular to apply the label refugee to any group of forced migrants, immigration enforcement agencies, especially in Europe, have fractioned the traditional refugee category by creating a bureaucratic hierarchy of asylum seeker eligibility in order to restrict admission (Zetter, 2007). It is against this politicised background that one must view the evolution of the term ‘climate refugee.’ Both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) caution against using either the term environmental refugee or climate refugee since they have no basis in international refugee law and could undermine the international legal regime for the protection of refugees (UNHCR, 2008; IOM, 2009). UNHCR further emphasises that much displacement due to climate-related factors is likely to be internal in nature, without the crossing of international borders. A more appropriate legal regime for climate-related migration may be human rights law (McAdam and Saul, 2008). Given their analytical flaws and lack of supporting evidence, why have these narratives gained so much momentum? Part of the reason lies in the ways they draw on deep-seated fears and stereotypes of the dark-skinned, over-breeding, dangerous poor (Hartmann, 2009). For example, a June 2009 ABC prime time television documentary on climate change, Earth 2100, scared the viewers with scenes of future apocalypse in which starving Africans take to arms against the West, desperate Mexicans storm the American border, and half the world population dies of a new plague so that humans can get back into balance with nature again. In policy circles, the persistence of these narratives is tied to their usefulness to a variety of interests. Critical literature on policy narratives illustrates the importance of population ‘crisis narratives’ in justifying certain kinds of Western development interventions— particularly the spread of commercial agriculture and forestry at the expense of peasant livelihoods—in Africa and elsewhere (Roe, 1995). A similar phenomenon is witnessed for climate narratives. For example, a 2008 report titled A Climate of Conflict argued that climate change would likely compound the propensity for violent conflict in 46 poor countries and political instability in another 56 (Smith and Vivekananda, 2008). Much of the authors’ analysis is based on old assumptions about the relationship between environmental scarcity and violence. They propose a solution in which international agencies invest in sustainable development, climate change adaptation measures and peace-building activities. There is also a role for multinational corporations. In this winwin world, the rich help the poor, and are largely absolved of responsibility for resource degradation and extraction, as well as political violence. It is as if the scramble for oil, minerals and land in Africa is of little consequence. However, it is also important to note that climate refugee and conflict narratives are sometimes deployed strategically by actors demanding that Western states take seriously their obligations to curb carbon emissions and provide adaptation assistance to affected communities. For example, in May 2009, twelve Pacific Island states brought a resolution to the UN General Assembly linking climate change to political instability in an attempt to get the Security Council to address their plight (MacFarquar, 2009). But even the best of intentions cannot obscure that we do not live in a win-win world, and that spinning climate change as a security threat is likely to undermine, rather than strengthen, serious efforts to link climate change mitigation and adaptation to development efforts that reduce poverty and promote equity. Playing with fear is like playing with fire. You cannot be sure exactly where it will spread. In the current moment, crisis narratives about climate refugees and conflict serve the interests of national security actors. The next section looks at the United States as a case study of how these narratives threaten to blur the line between development and military assistance, especially in Africa.",summarize the following text: ,"climate refugee and conflict narratives seem very much like old wine in a new bottle.

Despite the fact that the 25 million figure was arrived at more by conjecture than scientific method,1 it began to circulate widely in the international policy arena (Saunders, 2000; Nordas and Gleditsch, 2007). Now Myers claims there will be 200 million climate migrants by 2050, a figure which is similarly making the rounds in policy documents even though Myers himself acknowledges that the estimate is based on ‘heroic extrapolations’ (Brown, 2008, p. 8). In addition to unreliable statistics, the ‘environmental refugee’ concept has a number of shortcomings. It naturalises the economic and political causes of environmental degradation and masks the role of institutional responses to it. Should people forced to leave their homelands because of the development of a large dam, mine tailings, petroleum pollution or flooding caused by illegal logging all be categorised together as ‘environmental refugees’? In the case of extreme natural events such as droughts, storms and floods, whether or not people are forced to migrate permanently from their homes usually depends on pre-existing social relations (who is most vulnerable) and post-disaster responses (what kind of aid/relief is provided and who receives it). (Wisner et al., 2004). Rooted as it is in neo-Malthusian thinking, the concept of ‘environmental refugee’ overemphasises the role of demographic pressures in migration. The causes of migration are extremely complex and context-specific, and moreover, there is little evidence to support the view that demographic pressure is at the root of many population movements (Suhrke, 1997). In addition, negative neo-Malthusian narratives of migration obscure the positive roles migration can play in improving people’s livelihoods and diminishing vulnerability to environmental change. Often, migration from rural areas is not a linear phenomenon or a rejection of rural livelihoods, but is instead a vital part of sustaining them (Black, 1998). Despite such shortcomings, the environmental refugee concept was deployed by a variety of political actors. Sustainable development advocates found it useful to focus policy attention on environmental degradation issues (Black, 1998) and it also appealed to Western interests in favour of more rigid immigration controls, including limiting the grounds for political asylum. Kibreab argues that the term was invented in part to ‘depoliticise the causes of displacement’ so that states would not have the obligation to provide asylum (Kibreab, 1997, p. 21, cited in Saunders, 2000, p. 240). As the concept gained favour, environmental refugees were increasingly portrayed as a security threat, even though there was little serious research to substantiate the claim (Black, 1998). In the 1990s, political scientist Thomas Homer-Dixon propelled the degradation narrative and its negative depiction of migration into the ‘high politics’ of national security. Homer-Dixon’s (1999) environmental conflict model maintains that scarcities of renewable resources such as cropland, fresh water, and forests, induced in large part by population growth, contribute to migration and violent intrastate conflict in many parts of the developing world. In his own words: Population growth and unequal access to good land force huge numbers of people onto marginal lands. There, they cause environmental damage and become chronically poor. Eventually, they may be the source of persistent upheaval, or they may migrate yet again, helping to stimulate ethnic conflicts or urban unrest elsewhere (Homer-Dixon, 1999, p. 155). This conflict, in turn, can potentially disrupt international security as states fragment or become more authoritarian (for a critique of his model, see Hartmann, 2001). Homer-Dixon’s work had a major influence in Washington, DC policy circles particularly in the early years of the Clinton administration when Al Gore championed the environment as a cause. Its legacy persists today in the climate change arena where degradation narratives again link environmental change to violent conflict. UNEP’s report on Sudan, for example, draws on Homer-Dixon’s model and related research to make claims that overpopulation of both people and livestock, coupled with environmental stresses such as water shortages related to climate change, are at the root of conflict in the region (UNEP, 2007). Atlantic Monthly journalist Stephan Faris similarly argues that the real fault lines in Darfur are between ‘settled farmers and nomadic herders fighting over failing lands.’ And he attributes the failure of those lands primarily to climate changeinduced reductions in rainfall. ‘With countries across the region and around the world suffering similar pressures, some see Darfur as a canary in the coal mine, a foretaste of climate-driven political chaos’ (Faris, 2007). The narrative ignores basic elements of Sudanese political economy that helped create and sustain the conflict. These include gross inequalities in wealth and power between the elite in the capital and the rural population; government agricultural policies that favour large mechanised farms and irrigation schemes over rain-fed, small farmer agriculture, causing both political grievances and land degradation; forced migration, such as the 1990s removal of Nuba farmers from their lands into so-called ‘peace villages’ where they became a source of captive labour for mechanised farms; and what Alex de Waal calls ‘militarised tribalism’ (deWaal, 2007). In particular, the nationalisation of land in 1970, by which customary laws were set aside and people could obtain access only through lease agreements with the government, set the stage for widespread land-grabbing by elites and the marginalisation of pastoralists. As one scholar of the region notes, ‘. . .not all resource conflicts are based on a situation of resource scarcity; rather, they are political in nature and have to do with the workings of the Sudanese state’ (Manger, 2005, p. 135). The discovery of a vast underground aquifer underneath Northern Darfur is not likely to diffuse the crisis, but rather to heighten it, if the government controls the water for its own interests (Polgreen, 2007). The construction of Darfur as a climate conflict should serve as canary in the coal mine that something is amiss when environmental determinism overrides serious analysis of power relations. This is not to deny that environmental changes due to global warming could in some instances exacerbate already existing economic and political divisions. However, whether or not violent conflict and mass migrations result depends on so many other factors that it is far too simplistic to see climate change as a major cause or trigger. Moreover, such threat scenarios ignore the way many poorly resourced communities manage their affairs without recourse to violence. Brown et al. (2007) cite the case of the semi-arid regions of Northern Nigeria where conflicts between pastoralists and agricultural communities occur over water and fodder, but seldom spread because of the existence of traditional conflict resolution institutions. They argue that helping these communities adapt to climate change should involve strengthening such institutions. Research in the drylands of Marsabit District in Northern Kenya found that, in times of drought and water scarcity, there was actually less violence, not more (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007). Poor herdsmen were not inclined to start fights during droughts, and despite poverty and population growth in the region, strong but flexible common property regimes governing water helped people adjust to its scarcity. ‘If at any time a conflict over a scarce natural resource like water exists,’ the authors write, ‘it can be a sign that local resource users themselves have been made powerless and that their negotiating system has been paralysed, either by external agencies or local elites’ (Witsenburg and Roba, 2007, p. 235). A study done in northern Senegal from 1998–2002 concluded that drought-related migration led pastoralists to develop better strategies to manage herds and also had positive repercussions on the communities where they settled due to expansion of agriculture and trade (Juul, 2005). In fact, there is a rich body of empirical case studies of African agriculture, pastoralism and forestry that challenges conventional neo-Malthusian narratives about population, scarcity and conflict (e.g. Leach and Mearns, 1996; Gausset et al., 2005; Derman et al., 2007). Yet it is hardly ever cited in the environmental conflict or climate conflict literature. A certain exceptionalism is at work—while it is commonly assumed that scarcity can lead to institutional and technological innovation in more affluent countries, just the opposite is assumed for poor people in less affluent countries. Scarcity renders them into victims/ villains, incapable of innovation or livelihood diversification and naturally prone to violence. Also neglected in the climate conflict literature is scholarship that connects violent conflict in Africa more closely to resource abundance (e.g. rich oil and mineral reserves, valuable timber and diamonds) than resource scarcity (e.g. Fairhead, 2001). Today, critiques of ‘climate conflict’ are emerging. For example, regarding the implications of climate change for armed conflict, Buhaug et al. (2008) note the difficulty of coming up with any generalisable model since increased likelihood of organised violence ‘depends crucially on country-specific and contextual factors’ (p. 2). The report concludes that alarm about climate conflict is not based on substantive evidence. The term ‘climate refugees’ is also coming under increased scrutiny on a number of grounds. First, while climate change is likely to cause displacement, the extent of that displacement will not only depend on how much the temperature rises and affects sealevels, rainfall patterns and extreme weather, but also on the existence and effectiveness of adaptation measures that help individuals and communities cope with environmental stresses. Whether or not such measures are in place in turn depends on political economies at the local, regional, national and international levels that are often conveniently left out of the discussion of so-called ‘climate refugees.’ As one report points out, larger climaterelated humanitarian emergencies may be in places ‘where people cannot afford to move, rather than the places to which they do move’ (GECHS, 2008, p. 24). Secondly, migration is too complex a process to label simply as environmental or climate-induced (Dun and Gemenne, 2008; Morrissey, 2008, p. 28). For example, studying the impact of desertification on migration patterns in the northeastern Ethiopian highlands, Morrissey (2008) found that people’s decisions on whether to migrate or not were mediated by both structural and individual factors. These included the potential for livelihood diversification within rural areas as well as whether or not one had real opportunities and connections in urban areas. In addition, the high degree to which ethnicity has been politicised in the country limits migration options. His research shows the impossibility of providing a grand narrative, or simplistic model, of environmentally induced migration in which farmers experiencing adverse environmental change migrate out of those areas (and livelihoods) affected by environmental deterioration (p. 29). Even on islands and atolls threatened by sea-level rise, decisions to migrate can entail many more factors than climate change alone. A study of the small Pacific island nations of Kiribati and Tuvalu found that socio-economic pressures resulting from lack of employment and development opportunities as well as other kinds of environmental changes are the main drivers of out-migration. The role of climate change needs to be viewed together with these processes (McAdam and Loughry, 2009). A third area of concern is how the label ‘climate refugee,’ like ‘environmental refugee’ before it, could further undermine the rights and protections of traditional refugees as defined by the 1951 U.N. Refugee Convention (UNHCR, 1951/1967). According to the Convention, a refugee is someone who ‘owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion and nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside his country of nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country. . .’ (UNHCR, 1951/1967). At the same time that it has become popular to apply the label refugee to any group of forced migrants, immigration enforcement agencies, especially in Europe, have fractioned the traditional refugee category by creating a bureaucratic hierarchy of asylum seeker eligibility in order to restrict admission (Zetter, 2007). It is against this politicised background that one must view the evolution of the term ‘climate refugee.’ Both the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) caution against using either the term environmental refugee or climate refugee since they have no basis in international refugee law and could undermine the international legal regime for the protection of refugees (UNHCR, 2008; IOM, 2009). UNHCR further emphasises that much displacement due to climate-related factors is likely to be internal in nature, without the crossing of international borders. A more appropriate legal regime for climate-related migration may be human rights law (McAdam and Saul, 2008). Given their analytical flaws and lack of supporting evidence, why have these narratives gained so much momentum? Part of the reason lies in the ways they draw on deep-seated fears and stereotypes of the dark-skinned, over-breeding, dangerous poor (Hartmann, 2009). For example, a June 2009 ABC prime time television documentary on climate change, Earth 2100, scared the viewers with scenes of future apocalypse in which starving Africans take to arms against the West, desperate Mexicans storm the American border, and half the world population dies of a new plague so that humans can get back into balance with nature again. In policy circles, the persistence of these narratives is tied to their usefulness to a variety of interests. Critical literature on policy narratives illustrates the importance of population ‘crisis narratives’ in justifying certain kinds of Western development interventions— particularly the spread of commercial agriculture and forestry at the expense of peasant livelihoods—in Africa and elsewhere (Roe, 1995). A similar phenomenon is witnessed for climate narratives. For example, a 2008 report titled A Climate of Conflict argued that climate change would likely compound the propensity for violent conflict in 46 poor countries and political instability in another 56 (Smith and Vivekananda, 2008). Much of the authors’ analysis is based on old assumptions about the relationship between environmental scarcity and violence. They propose a solution in which international agencies invest in sustainable development, climate change adaptation measures and peace-building activities. There is also a role for multinational corporations. In this winwin world, the rich help the poor, and are largely absolved of responsibility for resource degradation and extraction, as well as political violence. It is as if the scramble for oil, minerals and land in Africa is of little consequence. However, it is also important to note that climate refugee and conflict narratives are sometimes deployed strategically by actors demanding that Western states take seriously their obligations to curb carbon emissions and provide adaptation assistance to affected communities. For example, in May 2009, twelve Pacific Island states brought a resolution to the UN General Assembly linking climate change to political instability in an attempt to get the Security Council to address their plight (MacFarquar, 2009). But even the best of intentions cannot obscure that we do not live in a win-win world, and that spinning climate change as a security threat is likely to undermine, rather than strengthen, serious efforts to link climate change mitigation and adaptation to development efforts that reduce poverty and promote equity. Playing with fear is like playing with fire. You cannot be sure exactly where it will spread. In the current moment, crisis narratives about climate refugees and conflict serve the interests of national security actors. The next section looks at the United States as a case study of how these narratives threaten to blur the line between development and military assistance, especially in Africa.",summarize the following text: ,"climate refugee and conflict narratives seem very much like old wine in a new bottle. The vintage goes back even further  to a degradation narrative Drawing on old colonial stereotypes of destructive Third World peasants and herders, the degradation narrative has proved particularly popular in Western policy circles because it kills a number of birds with one stone: it blames poverty on population pressure, and not, on lack of land reform or off-farm employment opportunities; it blames peasants for land degradation, obscuring the role of commercial agriculture and extractive industries and it targets migration both as an environmental and security threat  concern began to mount about the dangers posed by so-called ‘environmental refugees’.
