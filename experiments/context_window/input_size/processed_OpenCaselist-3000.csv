The possibility of abrupt climate change is linked to what may be the most problematic possibility of all—""positive"" feedback effects where the initial warming has effects that generate more warming. Several of these feedbacks are possible. First, the land's ability to store carbon could weaken. Soils and forests can dry out or burn and release carbon; less plant growth can occur, thus reducing nature's ability to remove carbon from the air. Second, carbon sinks in the oceans could also be reduced due to ocean warming and other factors. Third, the potent greenhouse gas methane could be released from peat bogs, wetlands, and thawing permafrost, and even from the methane hydrates in the oceans, as the planet warms and changes. Finally, the earth's albedo, the reflectivity of the earth's surface, is slated to be reduced as large areas now covered by ice and snow diminish or are covered by meltwater. All these effects would tend to make warming self-reinforcing, possibly leading to a greatly amplified greenhouse effect. The real possibility of these amplifying feedbacks has alarmed some of our top scientists. James Hansen, the courageous NASA climate scientist, is becoming increasingly outspoken as his investigations lead him to more and more disturbing conclusions. He offered the following assessment in 2007: ""Our home planet is now dangerously near a 'tipping point.' Human-made greenhouse gases are near a level such that important climate changes may proceed mostly under the climate system's own momentum. Impacts would include extermination of a large fraction of species on the planet, shifting of climatic zones due to an intensified hydrologic cycle with effects on freshwater availability and human health, and repeated worldwide coastal tragedies associated with storms and a continuously rising sea level. .. . ""Civilization developed during the Holocene, a period of relatively tranquil climate now almost 12,000 years in duration. The planet has been warm enough to keep ice sheets off North America and Europe, but cool enough for ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica to be stable. Now, with rapid warming of o.6°C in the past 30 years, global temperature is at its warmest level in the Holocene. ""This warming has brought us to the precipice of a great 'tipping point” If we go over the edge, it will be a transition to 'a different planet,' an environment far outside the range that has been experienced by humanity. There will be no return within the lifetime of any generation that can be imagined, and the trip will exterminate a large fraction of species on the planet.",summarize the following text: ,"the Edge of the World, pg. 26]

"Along with supporting diverse sites of human agency, rhetors may want to avoid the inherent conservatism of apocalyptic discourse. Apocalyptic rhetoric suggests that received sense-making systems (i.e., common sense) cannot explain great changes, but that various prophets can (Brummett, 1991). In the case of climate change, apocalyptic framing endows an array of experts and elites (including scientists, actuaries, politicians, and journalists) with the power to understand, frame, and perhaps resolve the issue; helping fuel the common sentiment that ordinary people cannot do anything to reduce global warming (Lorenzoni et al., 2007), or that they will not need to because ""'someone will invent the gizmo' that solves the problem"" (Gregg Easterbrook, quoted in Nocera, 2007, p. C1). Perhaps by linking climate change solutions to common sense-especially Americans' notions of sacrifice, conservation, community, and family (Moser & Dilling, 2004)-we may free scientists from their role as controversial prophets, while expanding agency beyond Fate. As our analysis suggests, simply creating awareness of an issue is not enough to create an active public. Rather, that awareness needs to work toward arousing the public toward action (Hallahan, 2001). In conclusion, an apocalyptic structure permeates the global warming narrative in the American elite and popular press, with the potential to force the predicted tragedy into being, due to its limitations on human agency. We echo the call for communication scholars of all methodological commitments to join environmental advocates, climate scientists, and others, in their efforts to build a collective will to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Moser & Dilling, 2007). A great part of this effort is in reframing the way the press constitutes climate change discourse (Boykoff, 2007b). These efforts also must extend beyond the media to include other arenas in which an active public is aroused, from kitchen tables and water coolers, to board rooms and classrooms. By providing the public, agenda-setting professionals (e.g., public relations practitioners and journalists), and community leaders with ways to structure communication that promote agency, rhetoricians might advance widespread public action on climate change. The apocalyptic frame, particularly in its tragic version, is not an effective rhetorical strategy for this situation. It has been developed over at least the last decade of press coverage, a time in which the US has refused all but the most paltry political action on greenhouse gas reductions. Tragic apocalyptic discourse encourages belief in prophesy at the expense of practicing persuasion, even as it provokes resignation in the face of a human-induced dilemma. Given the tragic apocalyptic frame's ineffectiveness at inspiring action-or, at least its persistent evacuation of agency-we must promote more action-oriented rhetorical strategies. Together, we may advance the climate change narrative from an apocalyptic tragedy to a more comic telos for humanity.",summarize the following text: ,"Along with supporting diverse sites of human agency, rhetors may want to avoid the inherent conservatism of apocalyptic discourse. apocalyptic framing endows an array of experts and elites with the power to understand, frame, and perhaps resolve the issue; helping fuel the common sentiment that ordinary people cannot do anything to reduce global warming or that they will not need to because ""'someone will invent the gizmo' that solves the problem by linking climate change solutions to common sense-especially Americans' notions of sacrifice, conservation, community, and family )-we may free scientists from their role as controversial prophets awareness needs to work toward arousing the public toward action We echo the call for communication scholars of all methodological commitments to join environmental advocates, climate scientists, and others, in their efforts to build a collective will to reduce greenhouse gas emissions These efforts also must extend beyond the media to include other arenas in which an active public is aroused, from kitchen tables and water coolers, to board rooms and classrooms.

"If a hemispheric partnership remains elusive, the costs to the United States and its neighbors will be high, in terms of both growing risks and missed opportunities. Without a partnership, the risk that criminal networks pose to the region’s people and institutions will continue to grow. Peaceful nuclear technology may be adopted more widely, but without proper safeguards, the risks of nuclear proliferation will increase. Adaptation to climate change will take place through isolated, improvised measures by individual countries, rather than through more effective efforts based on mutual learning and coordination. Illegal immigration to the United States will continue unabated and unregulated, adding to an ever-larger underclass that lives and works at the margins of the law. Finally, the countries around the hemisphere, including the United States, will lose valuable opportunities to tap new markets, make new investments, and access valuable resources. It is important to note at the outset that the term “partnership” as used in this report does not mean equal responsibility for all. The asymmetries between the United States and its neighbors are large and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Partnership here means a type of international cooperation whereby a group of countries identifies common interests, objectives, and solutions, and then each partner country undertakes responsibilities according to its own economic and political capacities to generate shared benefits. Today, four changes in the region have made a hemispheric partnership both possible and necessary. First, the key challenges faced by the United States and the hemisphere’s other countries— such as securing sustainable energy supplies, combating and adapting to climate change, and combating organized crime and drug trafficking—have become so complex and deeply transnational that they cannot be managed or overcome by any single country. Washington needs partners in the LAC region with a shared sense of responsibility and a common stake in the future. For example, drug trafficking and its associated criminal networks have now spread so widely across the hemisphere that they can no longer be regarded as a “U.S. problem,” a “Colombian problem,” or a “Mexican problem.” The threat posed by these networks can only be countered through coordinated efforts across producing, consuming, and transshipment countries, all of which have a shared interest in controlling the flow of arms, money, vehicles, and drugs. The process of combating and adapting to climate change also exemplifies the need for a hemispheric partnership.

"Should climate change be considered an emergency? Our aim here is to present some cautionary comments. Most discussion has approached the issue in terms of whether climate change really is an emergency. For example, does the evidence show that warming is proceeding faster than previously thought? Is there a tipping point beyond which climate change is irreversible? How soon and how drastically must carbon emissions be reduced? This way of thinking seems to be concerned with scientific matters, but actually it builds in social assumptions. Many of those who talk of a climate crisis or emergency assume that evidence about climate processes means that addressing climate change is the most urgent social issue, that the solution is policy change at the top, and that thinking of the issue as an emergency is an effective way of bringing about change. It is not the use of the word ""emergency"" that is necessarily significant here but rather the assumptions that so commonly go along with the word. We think these assumptions need to be brought out into the open and discussed. Let us be clear. We believe climate change is a vitally important issue. We believe action should be taken, the sooner and the more effective the better, to prevent the adverse consequences of global warming. Calling climate change an emergency might be a good approach - but on the other hand it might not be, indeed it might be counterproductive. We think both the advantages and disadvantages of emergency framing should be discussed. The emergency frame implicitly prioritises climate change above other issues. On the other hand, some critics, like Lomborg (2006), argue that other issues should have higher priority. We think it can be a mistake to prioritise one issue over others, because this may encourage competition between activists rather than cooperation. There are plenty of issues of vital importance in which millions of lives are at stake, among them nuclear war, global poverty, HIV, inequality - and smoking, which could kill one billion people this century (Proctor 2001). It is natural to expect campaigners on other vitally important issues - such as torture, sexual slavery and genocide - to remain committed to their concerns. Rather than prioritise climate change as more urgent, it may be more effective for climate change activists to work with other social justice campaigners to find ways to help each other - indeed, some are doing this already. Emergency framing can be used to sideline dissent within the climate change movement itself. For example, those who advocate highly ambitious targets for CO2 reduction may seek the high ground, presenting their position as the only option for humanity and stigmatising others as selling out. Internal democracy, divergent approaches and openness to new viewpoints can be dismissed as unaffordable luxuries when the future is at stake. Our view, instead, is that because climate change is such an important issue, maintaining democracy, diversity and dialogue within the movement is even more vital.",summarize the following text: ,"Should climate change be considered an emergency?

"When I argued a few months back that legalizing marijuana would be good for the environment, my main point was that illegal marijuana plantations endanger forests by operating under the radar--and unregulated--in some of our most pristine natural areas. They contaminate water supplies, result in deforestation, and threaten indigenous species. But I had no idea how widespread the destruction really was--just recently, the ""Save our Sierras"" campaign uncovered 69 marijuana plantations run by Mexican drug cartels and seized over a billion dollars worth of plants in California national forests. According to a report in Greenwire, ""Mexican drug trafficking organizations have been operating on public lands to cultivate marijuana, with serious consequences for the environment and public safety,"" said Gil Kerlikowske, chief of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy. In creating, and eventually abandoning, vast marijuana plantations the cartels are leaving heaps of trash, slaughtered animals, copious amounts of pesticides, and dangerous spilled fuels in their wake. Essentially, each plantation results in an environmental disaster. But the campaign to stop them is vigorous, and is already seeing encouraging results: The massive operation that began in February has already seized about 318,000 marijuana plants worth an estimated $1.1 billion, officials announced last week. In addition to 82 arrests, the multi-jurisdictional federal, state and local operation netted 42 pounds of processed marijuana, more than $40,000 in cash, 25 weapons and three vehicles. But there are still believed to be many plantations still in operation, and the cartels aren't slowing down. They've realized that it's cheaper and easier to fund the plantations from below the border and grow the marijuana closer to prime US markets--eliminating the need to smuggle the drugs across the border. Instead, US forests are suffering. The pesticides are perhaps the worst byproduct of the operations: Growers in Fresno County used a cocktail of pesticides and fertilizers many times stronger than what is used on residential lawns to cultivate their crop . . . While the chemical pesticides kill insects and other organisms directly, fertilizer runoff contaminates local waterways and aids in the growth of algae and weeds. The vegetation in turn impedes water flows that are critical to frogs, toads and salamanders in the Kings and San Joaquin rivers. As a response to the issue, California is hiring more forest service law enforcement, and expanding their efforts. But it seems to me that the surest way to prevent such destruction in the forests is to legalize the growing of marijuana, and thus removing the incentives to operate recklessly and clandestinely--and allowing for regulation of pesticide and fertilizer use. For now, however, I wish the Save our Sierras program continued luck in their good work.",summarize the following text: ,"illegal marijuana plantations endanger forests by operating under the radar and unregulated in our most pristine natural areas They contaminate water supplies result in deforestation, and threaten indigenous species But I had no idea how widespread the destruction really was the Sierras campaign uncovered 69 marijuana plantations run by Mexican drug cartels Mexican drug trafficking organizations have been operating on public lands to cultivate marijuana with serious consequences for the environment In creating and abandoning vast marijuana plantations the cartels are leaving heaps of trash slaughtered animals pesticides and dangerous spilled fuels each plantation results in an environmental disaster there are still believed to be many plantations still in operation cartels aren't slowing down They've realized that it's cheaper and easier to fund the plantations from below the border and grow the marijuana closer to prime US markets eliminating the need to smuggle the drugs across the border US forests are suffering pesticides are the worst byproduct of the operations: Growers used pesticides and fertilizers stronger than residential to cultivate crop the chemical pesticides kill insects and organisms fertilizer runoff contaminates local waterways and aids in the growth of algae and weeds vegetation impedes water flows that are critical to frogs, toads and salamanders in the rivers the surest way to prevent such destruction in the forests is to legalize the growing of marijuana removing the incentives to operate recklessly and clandestinely and allowing for regulation of pesticide and fertilizer use"
"[Janet, 3/31. ""What does the IPCC WGII report say on forests?"" www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/briefings/climate/2014/IPCC-WGII-Forests.pdf]
Deforestation accounts globally for about 12% of total man-made greenhouse gas emissions¶ (GHG). Deforestation causes roughly the same GHG emissions as both transport (13%) and ¶ agriculture (12%). ¶ • Forests are crucially important in soaking up humankind’s GHG emissions. Unfortunately,¶ deforestation largely cancels out this effect. While forests have taken up about 45% of the ¶ CO2 emissions to the atmosphere since 1750, this is roughly balanced by emissions from ¶ deforestation.¶ • Climate change is an additional stressor for forest ecosystems. Increased tree mortality has ¶ occurred in some regions, notably western and boreal North America – either as a result of ¶ high temperatures, drought, and/or changes in the distribution and abundance of insect pests ¶ and diseases which have been attributed, at least in part, to warming. In addition, the fire¶ regime in the boreal forests has intensified in recent decades.¶ What do the findings mean in practice?¶ • For forests, mitigation and adaptation go together. In order for humans to adapt to climate ¶ change, we need forests because they provide essential “services”, such as water, food and ¶ raw materials. Maintaining forests as intact, i.e. as unbroken tracts of forest landscape,¶ increases their resilience to climate change. This also enables the species living within them, ¶ to adapt to climate change and maintain these services.¶ • For the Amazon, a combination of deforestation and climate change could to lead to a ¶ “tipping point”, where the forest cover could change rapidly into savannah. This would cause ¶ not only a loss in biodiversity, but release carbon to the atmosphere, leading to additional ¶ climate change. However, climate change alone will not cause this tipping point to be ¶ reached this century, especially if warming remains below 2°C. Reductions in deforestation ¶ rates will also navigate us away from such a tipping point. The massive decline in ¶ deforestation rates for the Brazilian Amazon between the years 2005-2012 demonstrateshat policy-led approaches to curb deforestation can work (see IPCC WG2 Ch. 4). However, the reverse is also ¶ true as witnessed by last year’s increases in deforestation in the Amazon as a result of a severely weakened ¶ domestic forest policy.¶ What Greenpeace says about climate change and forests¶ Deforestation together with climate change makes for a vicious cocktail. Climate change is expected to increase ¶ periods of drought in tropical forests. At the same time, deforestation fragments the remaining forest, making it ¶ more vulnerable to drought-induced fires. Fires then release carbon, triggering even faster climate change. Last ¶ year’s massive forest fires in Indonesia were a stark reminder of what the future might look like if we do not end ¶ deforestation by the end of this decade.",summarize the following text: ,"Deforestation accounts globally for about 12% of total GHG roughly the same as transport and  ag Forests are crucially important in soaking up humankind’s GHG emissions deforestation cancels this Climate change is an additional stressor for forest ecosystems Increased tree mortality has  occurred as a result of  high temperatures, drought n order for humans to adapt to climate  change, we need forests because they provide essential “services”, such as water, food and  raw materials Maintaining forests as intact increases their resilience to climate change a combination of deforestation and climate change could to lead to a  “tipping point”, where the forest cover could change rapidly into savannah.

"Remote gambling is fundamentally different from brick-and-mortar casino gambling because the website operator never has complete control. Using technology undetectable to website operators and their regulators, it is possible for gamblers to play games from physical locations that are not what they seem. We know, because we have done it. Recently, House Energy and Commerce Committee staff and others in the Capitol Hill office of U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online. The Harper demonstration showed the technology and techniques that terror and crime organizations could use to operate untraceable money laundering built on a highly liquid legalized online poker industry — just the environment that will result from the spread of poker online. One of us set up a website — undetectablelaundering.com — to help communicate the problem to a broader audience. No one should doubt the ability of criminals to exploit the inherent weakness in online gambling. A drug cartel could arrange for buyers' machines to be remotely linked and lose to the aliased cartel machines. Drug buyers would not even need to play from their own machines. Illegal drug money would appear to be legal online winnings. A single poker game takes just a few hours to transfer $5 million as was recently demonstrated — legally — by American player Brian Hastings with his Swedish competitor half a world away.

"Remote gambling is fundamentally different from brick-and-mortar casino gambling because the website operator never has complete control. Using technology undetectable to website operators and their regulators, it is possible for gamblers to play games from physical locations that are not what they seem. We know, because we have done it. Recently, House Energy and Commerce Committee staff and others in the Capitol Hill office of U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online.

"The arguments voiced by online gambling opponents traditionally take one of two tacks: it’s either a moral scourge designed to lure impressionable youth into a life of degradation and depravity or a money laundering tool utilized by mafia types or digitally-savvy jihadis looking to fund their next terror plot. Just this December,infamous anti-gambling campaigner John W. Kindt (the ‘W’ is for ‘wack’) claimed the online poker bill cooked up by Senate majority leader Harry Reid would make it “easier for mobsters and even terrorists to launder money.” (Kindt also claimed that online gambling would bring down the global economy.) Such hyperbolic views are easy to dismiss when they come from nutters like Kindt, but it’s less of a joke when politicians holding the reins of power start accepting Kindt’s kind of blarney as gospel truth. Last year, European Union politicians were told that online gambling was the “perfect tool” for money laundering. This February, the European Commission proposed putting further restrictions on online gambling to monitor transactions for suspicious activities, with penalties of up to €5m for companies that failed to comply with these directives. With all due respect to the EU and the Financial Action Task Force, this is a solution in search of a problem. Members of the European Parliament (MEP) attended a workshop in Brussels last month at which Professor Friedrich Georg Schneider, an economist at the Johannes Kepler University of Linz, Austria, presented evidence that all gambling – land-based and online – accounted for a mere 0.5% of total money laundering activity. Schneider singled out online poker as a particularly ineffective method of laundering money, in no small part due to the high transaction costs. Schneider quoted a study of the German gambling market by consultancy Goldmedia that concluded that even if the entire online poker market was utilized solely for money laundering purposes, the total amount processed would represent just 3.2% of the estimated total sum generated by all criminal activity in Germany. Schneider said his research had led him to conclude that online poker was “by no means relevant for money laundering.” At the same meeting, Sven Stiel, Director Northern Europe for PokerStars’ parent company Rational Group, stated that the relatively small sums involved in online poker transactions “have no relevance with regard to money laundering.” Stiel also noted that since online gambling is a non-cash business, most of the money that flows into the site has already been handled (and presumably vetted) by the banking system. When MEP Jürgen Creutzmann tried to throw Stiel by asking him about anonymous payment methods, Stiel noted that prepaid cards can only be loaded with minimal sums, usually a maximum of €100 to €150, and the use of these cards requires players to log in via their individual accounts, making them easily identifiable.",summarize the following text: ,"an economist presented evidence that all gambling – land-based and online – accounted for a mere 0.5% of total money laundering activity in no small part due to the high transaction costs.

"The current regulatory system for marijuana is broken. As more states move to legalize the substance, the problems will only get worse. Due to this patchwork system, many operating in compliance with state law may find themselves raided and their businesses ruined, while others that are actually breaking both federal and state laws may never be caught. Many patients who need marijuana for legitimate medical purposes can’t obtain it legally. They are forced to the black market, risking their safety and paying exorbitant prices. Simultaneously, medical marijuana programs have the potential to become safe havens for those looking to use the drug for relaxation or recreational purposes. Today, legitimate marijuana businesses can’t operate like other businesses, and state tax laws often aren’t consistent with their marijuana laws. Federal prosecutors and local law enforcement in each state often handle the situation differently, and the entire industry – an industry that many Americans support – remains clouded by uncertainty, illegitimacy and fear.¶ It is time to make a change. While individual states remain the laboratories of innovation, it is time for the federal government to make sure that states, businesses, and individuals are able to act in an environment that has coherent and consistent laws. Congress should pursue each of the following options: 1. Tax and Regulate Marijuana Considering the growing number of jurisdictions that legalize medical marijuana and the two jurisdictions that legalize recreational use, it is time that Congress end the federal prohibition on marijuana, removing it from the Controlled Substances Act and creating a regulatory and taxation framework, similar to the frameworks in place for alcohol and tobacco. A specific tax on marijuana grown for all purposes should be imposed to help fund substance abuse dependency treatment, law enforcement, and help reduce the federal debt. Revenue estimates from taxing marijuana vary due to uncertainties surrounding the existing marijuana market and how legalization and regulation would impact price and consumption habits. Assuming increased legal consumption and reduction in prices, a $50 per ounce tax, for example, would raise estimated revenue of $20 billion annually. 53 Any study of the fiscal impact should also include the savings generated by reduced expenditures on marijuana interdiction and enforcement. This represents a unique opportunity to save ruined lives, wasted enforcement and prison costs, while simultaneously creating a new industry, with new jobs and revenues that will improve the federal budget outlook. Passing such legislation would represent a key part of a comprehensive approach to marijuana reform. However Congress should also consider additional legislation that would ease problems during this transitional period, such as exempting medical marijuana specifically to ensure patient access, and alleviating specific tax and business challenges.",summarize the following text: ,"The current regulatory system for marijuana is broken.

However, whether as an approach to learning, innovation, persuasion or culture shift, policy simulations derive their power from two central features: their combination of simulation and gaming (Geurts et al. 2007). 1. The simulation element: the unique combination of simulation with role-playing. The unique simulation/role-play mix enables participants to create possible futures relevant to the topic being studied. This is diametrically opposed to the more traditional, teacher-centric approaches in which a future is produced for them. In policy simulations, possible futures are much more than an object of tabletop discussion and verbal speculation. ‘No other technique allows a group of participants to engage in collective action in a safe environment to create and analyse the futures they want to explore’ (Geurts et al. 2007: 536). 2. The game element: the interactive and tailor-made modelling and design of the policy game. The actual run of the policy simulation is only one step, though a most important and visible one, in a collective process of investigation, communication, and evaluation of performance. In the context of a post-graduate course in public policy development, for example, a policy simulation is a dedicated game constructed in collaboration with practitioners to achieve a high level of proficiency in relevant aspects of the policy development process. To drill down to a level of finer detail, policy development simulations—as forms of interactive or participatory modelling— are particularly effective in developing participant knowledge and skills in the five key areas of the policy development process (and success criteria), namely: Complexity, Communication, Creativity, Consensus, and Commitment to action (‘the five Cs’). The capacity to provide effective learning support in these five categories has proved to be particularly helpful in strategic decision-making (Geurts et al. 2007).

The Asia-Pacific region can be regarded as a zone of both relative insecurity and strategic stability. It contains some of the world’s most significant flashpoints – the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the Siachen Glacier – where tensions between nations could escalate to the point of major war. It is replete with unresolved border issues; is a breeding ground for transnationa terrorism and the site of many terrorist activities (the Bali bombings, the Manila superferry bombing); and contains overlapping claims for maritime territories (the Spratly Islands, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands) with considerable actual or potential wealth in resources such as oil, gas and fisheries. Finally, the Asia-Pacific is an area of strategic significance with many key sea lines of communication and important chokepoints. Yet despite all these potential crucibles of conflict, the Asia-Pacific, if not an area of serenity and calm, is certainly more stable than one might expect. To be sure, there are separatist movements and internal struggles, particularly with insurgencies, as in Thailand, the Philippines and Tibet. Since the resolution of the East Timor crisis, however, the region has been relatively free of open armed warfare. Separatism remains a challenge, but the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance, but its impact is contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearisation of the peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict any time soon, especially given recent Kuomintang Party victories in Taiwan and efforts by Taiwan and China to re-open informal channels of consultation as well as institutional relationships between organisations responsible for cross-strait relations. And while in Asia there is no strong supranational political entity like the European Union, there are many multilateral organisations and international initiatives dedicated to enhancing peace and stability, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. In Southeast Asia, countries are united in a common geopolitical and economic organisation – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – which is dedicated to peaceful economic, social and cultural development, and to the promotion of regional peace and stability. ASEAN has played a key role in conceiving and establishing broader regional institutions such as the East Asian Summit, ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and South Korea) and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

"Policy Details The actual outcomes of any scheme of legal access would depend strongly on details rarely mentioned in the abstract pro-and-con discussion of whether to legalise. The risk of a large increase in damaging forms of consumption would be greater at a lower price; the need for enforcement against illicit production and sale, or tax evasion by licensed producers and sellers, would be higher. Another central decision is whether to allow private for-profit enterprises to produce and sell cannabis, or instead to restrict licit activity to: (1) Production for personal use and free distribution only. (2) Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises such as consumer-owned cooperatives like the Spanish ‘cannabis clubs’ (3) Some variety of state monopoly, perhaps of retail sales only, leaving production to private enterprise. If the private enterprise model is chosen, an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration to ensure the existence of a variety of competing firms (thus perhaps limiting the marketing and political power of the industry as a whole and – again perhaps – increasing the rate of product innovation and the range of products easily available) or instead to allow the likely development of oligopolistic competition, as in the markets for cigarettes and beer. A potential advantage of legalisation would be the provision of consumer information superior to that available on the illicit market. The corresponding disadvantage might be the application of powerful marketing techniques to making excessive consumption seem desirable and fashionable. Cannabis is a more complex product than beer, with at least two and perhaps dozens of significantly psychoactive chemicals and, to date, only limited scientific knowledge about their actions and interactions. Requiring accurate label information about chemical content seems a sensible approach, but not all consumers will be able to make good use of a collection of chemical names and percentages. Industry participants could be given the responsibility of providing sound consumer information, including due warnings about the risks of habituation, at the point of sale or via websites, or that responsibility could be assigned to NGOs or public agencies, perhaps financed by cannabis taxation. It seems at least arguable that cannabis sales personnel should have extensive training both about the pharmacology of the drug and about offering good advice to consumers, making their role closer to that of a pharmacist or nutritionist than of a mere sales clerk or bartender. By the same token, decisions would have to be made and executed about whether and how to limit marketing efforts. To some eyes at least, the alcohol industry provides a warning by example of what could go wrong. In the United States, the doctrine of ‘commercial free speech’ might gravely impair the capacity of the state to allow private enterprise but restrain promotion.",summarize the following text: ,Policy Details The actual outcomes of any scheme of legal access would depend strongly on details rarely mentioned in the abstract pro-and-con discussion of whether to legalise A central decision is whether to allow private enterprises or restrict licit activity to Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises Some variety of state monopoly If the private enterprise model is chosen an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration or allow oligopolistic competition as in the markets for cigarettes and beer label information consumer information point of sale taxation sales training decisions have to be made about marketing
"(Associated Press, Six Degree Temperature Rise by 2100 is Inevitable: UNEP, September 24, http://www.speedy-fit.co.uk/index2.php?option=com_content&do_pdf=1&id=168)
Earth's temperature is likely to jump six degrees between now and the end of the century even if every country cuts greenhouse gas emissions as proposed, according to a United Nations update. Scientists looked at emission plans from 192 nations and calculated what would happen to global warming. The projections take into account 80 percent emission cuts from the U.S. and Europe by 2050, which are not sure things. The U.S. figure is based on a bill that passed the House of Representatives but is running into resistance in the Senate, where debate has been delayed by health care reform efforts. Carbon dioxide, mostly from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, is the main cause of global warming, trapping the sun's energy in the atmosphere. The world's average temperature has already risen 1.4 degrees since the 19th century. Much of projected rise in temperature is because of developing nations, which aren't talking much about cutting their emissions, scientists said at a United Nations press conference Thursday. China alone adds nearly 2 degrees to the projections. ""We are headed toward very serious changes in our planet,"" said Achim Steiner, head of the U.N.'s environment program, which issued the update on Thursday. The review looked at some 400 peer-reviewed papers on climate over the last three years.  Even if the developed world cuts its emissions by 80 percent and the developing world cuts theirs in half by 2050, as some experts propose, the world is still facing a 3-degree increase by the end of the century, said Robert Corell, a prominent U.S. climate scientist who helped oversee the update.  Corell said the most likely agreement out of the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December still translates into a nearly 5-degree increase in world temperature by the end of the century. European leaders and the Obama White House have set a goal to limit warming to just a couple degrees.  The U.N.'s environment program unveiled the update on peer-reviewed climate change science to tell diplomats how hot the planet is getting. The last big report from the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out more than two years ago and is based on science that is at least three to four years old, Steiner said.  Global warming is speeding up, especially in the Arctic, and that means that some top-level science projections from 2007 are already out of date and overly optimistic. Corell, who headed an assessment of warming in the Arctic, said global warming ""is accelerating in ways that we are not anticipating.""  Because Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are melting far faster than thought, it looks like the seas will rise twice as fast as projected just three years ago, Corell said. He said seas should rise about a foot every 20 to 25 years.",summarize the following text: ,"Earth's temperature is likely to jump six degrees between now and the end of the century even if every country cuts greenhouse gas emissions The projections take into account 80 percent emission cuts from the U.S. and Europe by 2050, which are not sure things Much of projected rise in temperature is because of developing nations, which aren't talking much about cutting their emissions China alone adds 2 degrees to the projections Even if the developed world cuts its emissions by 80 percent and the developing world cuts theirs in half by 2050 the world is still facing a 3-degree increase by the end of the century Global warming is speeding up that means top-level science projections from 2007 are already out of date and overly optimistic Because Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are melting far faster than thought seas will rise twice as fast as projected just three years ago seas should rise a foot every 20 years"

Our final contrasting set of expectations relates to the degree to which the public will support or demand retribution against terrorists and supporting states. Here our data show that support for using conventional United States military force to retaliate against terrorists initially averaged above midscale, but did not reach a high level of demand for military action. Initial support declined significantly across all demographic and belief categories by the time of our survey in 2002. Furthermore, panelists both in 2001 and 2002 preferred that high levels of certainty about culpability (above 8.5 on a scale from zero to ten) be established before taking military action. Again, we find the weight of evidence supporting revisionist expectations of public opinion. Overall, these results are inconsistent with the contention that highly charged events will result in volatile and unstructured responses among mass publics that prove problematic for policy processes. The initial response to the terrorist strikes demonstrated a broad and consistent shift in public assessments toward a greater perceived threat from terrorism, and greater willingness to support policies to reduce that threat. But even in the highly charged context of such a serious attack on the American homeland, the overall public response was quite measured. On average, the public showed very little propensity to undermine speech protections, and initial willingness to engage in military retaliation moderated significantly over the following year. Perhaps most interesting is that the greatest propensity to change beliefs between 2001 and 2002 was evident among the best-educated and wealthiest of our respondents— hardly the expected source of volatility, but in this case they may have represented the leading edge of belief constraints reasserting their influence in the first year following 9/11. This post-9/11 change also reflected an increasing delineation of policy preferences by ideological and partisan positions. Put differently, those whose beliefs changed the most in the year between surveys also were those with the greatest access to and facility with information (the richest, best educated), and the nature of the changes was entirely consistent with a structured and coherent pattern of public beliefs. Overall, we find these patterns to be quite reassuring, and consistent with the general findings of the revisionist theorists of public opinion. Our data suggest that while United States public opinion may exhibit some fault lines in times of crises, it remains securely anchored in bedrock beliefs.",summarize the following text: ,"our data show that support for using military force to retaliate against terrorists initially averaged above midscale, but did not reach a high level of demand for military action panelists preferred that high levels of certainty about culpability be established before taking military action.

"I’m going to make a radical claim, well, actually it’s pretty widely accepted in the social sciences:  There is no “choice.”  This isn’t about the individual.  This is about systems of oppression and social structures that shape our behavior and limit what choices are available to us based on our social identity. If you are a young, thin, white woman advocating for Nonhuman Animals in a pornified, hyper-sexualized society, one choice stands out loud and clear: Get naked. It’s supposed to be empowering, and we think maybe it helps animals.
First, I’m not really sure why one has to feel sexually empowered when one is advocating against the torture and death of Nonhuman Animals. Why our movement is keen on making violence a turn on is a little disturbing. It probably speaks something to our tendency to juxtapose women with violence. The sexualization of violence against women and other feminized social groups like Nonhuman Animals is evidence to the rape culture we inhabit.
Aside that, however, “choice” is often thrown around as a means of deflecting critical thought at systems of oppression. If it’s all about your individual choice, only you are responsible, only you are to blame. Anyone who has a problem with that must be judging you as a person. So often our advocacy is framed as personal choice, an individual expression. If you aren’t vegan, that’s your “choice.” If you want to have sex with vegetables and have it filmed by PETA, that’s your “choice.” This is a co-optation of anti-oppression social activism in a neo-liberal structure of exploitation.
Neoliberalism is all about “freedom”: Freedom from government,freedom from regulation, freedom to buy, freedom to sell, freedom to reach your full potential, etc. It’s about individuals out for themselves. This is how capitalism thrives: many are free to do whatever they want in the name of open markets, but ultimately, that freedom comes at a cost to those who will inevitably be exploited to pay for that “freedom.” The ideology of neoliberalism and individualism works to benefit the privileged when individuals can attribute their success to their own individual hard work (when in reality they had extensive help from their race, gender, class, physical ability, etc.). It also works to blame those less fortunate for their failure. We call them lazy, stupid, leeches (when in reality they had extensive barriers placed upon them according to their race, gender, class, physical ability, etc.).
This myth of freedom and meritocracy is actually pretty toxic for social movements. If we fail to recognize how structural barriers impede some, while structural privileges benefit others, we will find it difficult to come together as a political collective.

"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed. “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains. This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy. Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it. There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.” Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks. On the other hand, the hemp-food industry is “pretty well settled,” says Murphy. If hemp growing were legalized in the U.S., he adds, a lot of Canadian processors would probably open facilities here. Legalization would also help hemp food break out of its niche-market status. If it received “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the Food and Drug Administration, major brands would be less reluctant to use it. Until then, he says, Coca-Cola won’t put hemp milk in Odwalla Future Shakes, and we’re not likely to see hempseed Clif Bars. Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry, says Murphy. Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized in 1998. The nation’s production leaped to 35,000 acres in 1999 and plummeted to about 4,000 in 2001, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada’s main hemp-producing province. It soared to 48,000 acres in 2006 and fell to less than 10,000 two years later.",summarize the following text: ,"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it.

"One potential form of challenge to sovereign power consists of a refusal to draw any lines between zoe- and bios, inside and outside.59 As we have shown, sovereign power does not involve a power relation in Foucauldian terms. It is more appropriately considered to have become a form of governance or technique of administration through relationships of violence that reduce political subjects to mere bare or naked life. In asking for a refusal to draw lines as a possibility of challenge, then, we are not asking for the elimination of power relations and consequently, we are not asking for the erasure of the possibility of a mode of political being that is empowered and empowering, is free and that speaks: quite the opposite. Following Agamben, we are suggesting that it is only through a refusal to draw any lines at all between forms of life (and indeed, nothing less will do) that sovereign power as a form of violence can be contested and a properly political power relation (a life of power as potenza) reinstated. We could call this challenging the logic of sovereign power through refusal. Our argument is that we can evade sovereign power and reinstate a form of power relation by contesting sovereign power’s assumption of the right to draw lines, that is, by contesting the sovereign ban. Any other challenge always inevitably remains within this relationship of violence. To move outside it (and return to a power relation) we need not only to contest its right to draw lines in particular places, but also to resist the call to draw any lines of the sort sovereign power demands.¶ The grammar of sovereign power cannot be resisted by challenging or fighting over where the lines are drawn. Whilst, of course, this is a strategy that can be deployed, it is not a challenge to sovereign power per se as it still tacitly or even explicitly accepts that lines must be drawn somewhere (and preferably more inclusively). Although such strategies contest the violence of sovereign power’s drawing of a particular line, they risk replicating such violence in demanding the line be drawn differently. This is because such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which, as Agamben points out, renders us all now homines sacri or bare life.¶ Taking Agamben’s conclusion on board, we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge. Agamben puts it in terms of a transformation:¶ This biopolitical body that is bare life must itself instead be transformed into the site for the constitution and installation of a form of life that is wholly exhausted in bare life and a bios that is only its own zoe-.... If we give the name form-of-life to this being that is only its own bare existence and to this life that, being its own form, remains inseparable from it we will witness the emergence of a field of research beyond the terrain defined by the intersection of politics and philosophy, medico-biological sciences and jurisprudence.60",summarize the following text: ,"One potential form of challenge to sovereign power consists of a refusal to draw any lines between zoe- and bios, inside and outside sovereign power does not involve a power relation .

"Policy Details The actual outcomes of any scheme of legal access would depend strongly on details rarely mentioned in the abstract pro-and-con discussion of whether to legalise. The risk of a large increase in damaging forms of consumption would be greater at a lower price; the need for enforcement against illicit production and sale, or tax evasion by licensed producers and sellers, would be higher. Another central decision is whether to allow private for-profit enterprises to produce and sell cannabis, or instead to restrict licit activity to: (1) Production for personal use and free distribution only. (2) Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises such as consumer-owned cooperatives like the Spanish ‘cannabis clubs’ (3) Some variety of state monopoly, perhaps of retail sales only, leaving production to private enterprise. If the private enterprise model is chosen, an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration to ensure the existence of a variety of competing firms (thus perhaps limiting the marketing and political power of the industry as a whole and – again perhaps – increasing the rate of product innovation and the range of products easily available) or instead to allow the likely development of oligopolistic competition, as in the markets for cigarettes and beer. A potential advantage of legalisation would be the provision of consumer information superior to that available on the illicit market. The corresponding disadvantage might be the application of powerful marketing techniques to making excessive consumption seem desirable and fashionable. Cannabis is a more complex product than beer, with at least two and perhaps dozens of significantly psychoactive chemicals and, to date, only limited scientific knowledge about their actions and interactions. Requiring accurate label information about chemical content seems a sensible approach, but not all consumers will be able to make good use of a collection of chemical names and percentages. Industry participants could be given the responsibility of providing sound consumer information, including due warnings about the risks of habituation, at the point of sale or via websites, or that responsibility could be assigned to NGOs or public agencies, perhaps financed by cannabis taxation. It seems at least arguable that cannabis sales personnel should have extensive training both about the pharmacology of the drug and about offering good advice to consumers, making their role closer to that of a pharmacist or nutritionist than of a mere sales clerk or bartender. By the same token, decisions would have to be made and executed about whether and how to limit marketing efforts. To some eyes at least, the alcohol industry provides a warning by example of what could go wrong. In the United States, the doctrine of ‘commercial free speech’ might gravely impair the capacity of the state to allow private enterprise but restrain promotion.",summarize the following text: ,Policy Details The actual outcomes of any scheme of legal access would depend strongly on details rarely mentioned in the abstract pro-and-con discussion of whether to legalise A central decision is whether to allow private enterprises or restrict licit activity to Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises Some variety of state monopoly If the private enterprise model is chosen an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration or allow oligopolistic competition as in the markets for cigarettes and beer label information consumer information point of sale taxation sales training decisions have to be made about marketing

The second feature of commodification is that it reduces bonds with other human beings to formal covenants; it moves ""relationships"" into the territory of ""contracts,"" in a parallel way to which ""persons"" become ""things"" and are for sale relationships between people enter the market place. A view in which relationships are for sale runs counter to most philosophical accounts of persons, and most especially to those where individuals are intrinsically social beings, embedded in complex relations with others, as philosophers such as Aristotle (2004), Taylor (1992), and Sandel (1998) have argued. In the market, however, according to Marx (1844), workers are alienated (to maximize profits), not just from their labor, and its products, but from others, such that the market converts relationships between [humans] to relationships between property owners. Taking this as a whole, to commodify, is to de-emhasize that individuals are, constitutively, relational beings and have interdependent ties to others and particular needs and wants, and instead is to shift toward seeing the connections between individuals as interchangeable, established and disestablished as the market requires, and valued only in extrinsic monetary terms. That is ""relationships"" between individuals become mere services for ""contracts ' Importantly, for both elements of commodification, It need not be the case that in fact happening to qualify as commodificatory. What matters is how persons and relationships are regarded; if they are treated (through language or conception, for instance) as being objects where trade could legiti- mately occur, then commodification has occurred. That is, moving from ""persons' to ""things"" and ""relationships"" to ""contracts,"" ""includes not only actual buying and selling, but also market rhetoric, the practice of thinking about interactions as if they were sale transactions"" (Radin, 1987, 1859, original emphasis). Though one may not partake in buying and selling of body parts or services, for instance, engaging in the view that they could be bought and sold is itself to endorse a commodificatory shift; it is to treat something which is not a ""thing"" or subjectable to ""contract"" as if it were. Thus, it is not only the act but the ""social practice for treating things as commodities, i.e. as properties that can be bought, sold, or rented"" (Resnik, 1998, p. 388) which amounts to commodification. This section sought to provide a working definition of commodification. It has stated that commodification is the (actual or implied) transformation of: first ""persons"" into ""things,"" and second ""relationships"" into ""contracts.""",summarize the following text: ,"commodification  reduces bonds with other human beings to formal covenants it moves ""relationships"" into the territory of ""contracts, in a parallel way to which ""persons"" become ""things"" and are for sale In the market workers are alienated (to maximize profits), not just from their labor but from others the market converts relationships between humans] to relationships between property owners to commodify, is to de-emhasize that individuals are beings and have interdependent ties to others and instead is to shift toward seeing connections between individuals as the market requires and valued only in extrinsic monetary terms relationships"" between individuals become mere services for ""contracts moving from ""persons' to ""things includes not only actual buying and selling, but also market rhetoric, the practice of thinking about interactions as if they were sale transactions Though one may not partake in buying and selling of body parts or services engaging in the view that they could be bought and sold is itself to endorse a commodificatory shift it is not only the act but the ""social practice for treating things as commodities, i.e. as properties that can be bought, sold, or rented"

"U.S. history is fraught with contradiction. There seems to have¶ been a persistent divide between its represented self-image and its¶ actions in the world. It has viewed itself as a land of the free,¶ where individuals have free reign to maximize their wealth and¶ pursue happiness without the constraints of government inhibiting¶ their freedom, while ignoring the way in which government typically¶ enforced the rights of one group over another (McCaull, 1976)¶ and provided the infrastructure and investments that made development¶ possible (Novak, 2008; Limerick, 2012). It has promoted its¶ exceptional nature and asserted its difference from all previous¶ empires, advocating fundamental human rights and opportunity¶ for all, though its society has been one of profound segregation¶ (Perlstein, 2006), with a foreign policy more often than not brutal,¶ repressive, and indeed essentially imperialistic (Chomsky, 1998;¶ McCoy, 2009)—a foreign policy that then in turn transformed domestic¶ policy by importing its policing practices back home (McCoy¶ & Scarano, 2009; Chomsky, 1999; De Genova, 2010; Steinmetz,¶ 2005, pp. 357–361). Founded on the genocide of its Indigenous¶ population, the U.S. has defined its brave and free persona by glorifying¶ its revolution that shook off the empire’s grip, yet has been¶ leading a global counterinsurgent “War on Terrorism” that defines¶ resistance as a threat that must be eliminated.¶ One such contradiction—the contrast of a projected benign history¶ of the quest for freedom and rights with the reality of American¶ ascent to global domination—is discussed by Novak (2008). In¶ addressing what he calls the “myth of the ‘weak’ American state”,¶ he shows how there is “an almost pathological tendency to confuse¶ American ideal with historical political reality,” and a constant¶ tension between “liberty and power, freedom and authority, contract¶ and coercion, and law and violence” (Novak, 2008, p. 754). In¶ the author’s view, the myth of an American weak state has its¶ roots in an exceptionalist view of the U.S as being a new world exempted¶ from previous political histories by a “so-called ‘natural’¶ development of individualism, private rights, civil society, free labour,¶ and a free economy” (Novak, 2008, pp. 754–755). McCaull¶ (1976) considers this sense of exceptionalism to be underpinned by¶ a Spencerian theory of social evolution that presents American industry¶ as the pinnacle of man’s [humanity’s] ever ascending rise to perfection.¶ This “social Darwinism” that applied biological notions of survival¶ of the fittest to human society provided legitimacy for rapacious¶ and competitive social and economic practices by presenting them¶ as a natural and normal continuation of evolution toward complexity.¶ Spencer’s theory was thus co-opted by American industrialists¶ as a powerful “scientific” tool of laissez faire capitalism legitimation,¶ reminiscent of the Malthusian arguments discussed earlier,¶ that rooted their reasoning in the laws of nature so as to give them¶ an air of inevitability.",summarize the following text: ,"U.S. history is fraught with contradiction.

"Again the focus is on the potential for harm, while ignoring the motives and operational logic of perpetrators. If internet anonymity is awkward for targets of attacks, it is certainly also a problem for initiators. Terrorists spend as much time trying to market their exploits as they do fighting, bombing, assassinating, etc. Where anonymity protects an aggressor from retribution, it also dilutes credit for the deed. Vandals often “tag” their handiwork—creating an identity where none need exist—precisely because anonymity has both advantages and drawbacks. Internet vandals also brand their exploits, presumably in an effort to counteract, rather than maximize, anonymity. Just as ongoing cyber attacks from unidentified sources do not give the target a way to retaliate, they also do not give the target a ready way to accommodate an attacker's demands. Demands from an anonymous cyber warrior will tend to be ignored or reneged on, once vulnerabilities are identified and addressed. Demands might also come from a source that did not, or even was not capable of, mounting a cyber attack. As with the use of identifying symbols in war, it is in the interest of the attacker to “brand” its efforts in order to elicit concessions from a target. Indeed, even if demands are complied with, it will be difficult for an attacker to obtain sustained compliance, given the impossibility of demonstrating future capabilities and the temporary nature of harm. Discussion of attribution problems in cyber space also reflects a subtle but telling shift in framing. Libicki's simple calculus of deterrence, for example, involves “getting caught,” something more often characteristic of crime than war. Some aspects of international relations involve anonymity. Espionage, covert operations and certain kinds of political theft or murder function most effectively when the perpetrators are unknown, or indeed when the operations themselves remain undisclosed. Strategic or tactical advantage can also stem from anonymity and surprise in terrestrial military missions, though nations and groups often sacrifice surprise and advertise their role in contests in order to exercise advantages in the form of foreign concessions or tacit or formal admission of defeat. How does one surrender to no one in particular? The advantage of anonymity will persist for peripheral forms of warfare on the internet, just as it has played a role in terrestrial competition and conflict. But most forms of warfare or potential warfare actually invite disclosure of an initiator's identity. As I have already noted, coercion requires attribution, not of the target but by the initiator. Similarly, threats designed to elicit concessions or deter aggression are already problematic in physical space (Powell 1990, Nalebu 1991). This “credibility problem” mirrors the attribution problem and is likely to make internet aggression all the more problematic for initiators.",summarize the following text: ,"the focus is on the potential for harm, while ignoring the motives and operational logic of perpetrators. If internet anonymity is awkward for targets of attacks, it is certainly also a problem for initiators. Terrorists spend as much time trying to market their exploits as they do fighting Where anonymity protects an aggressor from retribution, it also dilutes credit for the deed Just as ongoing cyber attacks from unidentified sources do not give the target a way to retaliate, they also do not give the target a ready way to accommodate an attacker's demands. Demands from an anonymous cyber warrior will tend to be ignored or reneged on, once vulnerabilities are identified and addressed it is in the interest of the attacker to “brand” its efforts in order to elicit concessions from a target. even if demands are complied with, it will be difficult for an attacker to obtain sustained compliance, given the impossibility of demonstrating future capabilities and the temporary nature of harm"
"One potential form of challenge to sovereign power consists of a refusal to draw any lines between zoe- and bios, inside and outside.59 As we have shown, sovereign power does not involve a power relation in Foucauldian terms. It is more appropriately considered to have become a form of governance or technique of administration through relationships of violence that reduce political subjects to mere bare or naked life. In asking for a refusal to draw lines as a possibility of challenge, then, we are not asking for the elimination of power relations and consequently, we are not asking for the erasure of the possibility of a mode of political being that is empowered and empowering, is free and that speaks: quite the opposite. Following Agamben, we are suggesting that it is only through a refusal to draw any lines at all between forms of life (and indeed, nothing less will do) that sovereign power as a form of violence can be contested and a properly political power relation (a life of power as potenza) reinstated. We could call this challenging the logic of sovereign power through refusal. Our argument is that we can evade sovereign power and reinstate a form of power relation by contesting sovereign power’s assumption of the right to draw lines, that is, by contesting the sovereign ban. Any other challenge always inevitably remains within this relationship of violence. To move outside it (and return to a power relation) we need not only to contest its right to draw lines in particular places, but also to resist the call to draw any lines of the sort sovereign power demands.¶ The grammar of sovereign power cannot be resisted by challenging or fighting over where the lines are drawn. Whilst, of course, this is a strategy that can be deployed, it is not a challenge to sovereign power per se as it still tacitly or even explicitly accepts that lines must be drawn somewhere (and preferably more inclusively). Although such strategies contest the violence of sovereign power’s drawing of a particular line, they risk replicating such violence in demanding the line be drawn differently. This is because such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which, as Agamben points out, renders us all now homines sacri or bare life.¶ Taking Agamben’s conclusion on board, we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge. Agamben puts it in terms of a transformation:¶ This biopolitical body that is bare life must itself instead be transformed into the site for the constitution and installation of a form of life that is wholly exhausted in bare life and a bios that is only its own zoe-.... If we give the name form-of-life to this being that is only its own bare existence and to this life that, being its own form, remains inseparable from it we will witness the emergence of a field of research beyond the terrain defined by the intersection of politics and philosophy, medico-biological sciences and jurisprudence.60",summarize the following text: ,"One potential form of challenge to sovereign power consists of a refusal to draw any lines between zoe- and bios, inside and outside sovereign power does not involve a power relation .

"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed. “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains. This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy. Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it. There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.” Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks. On the other hand, the hemp-food industry is “pretty well settled,” says Murphy. If hemp growing were legalized in the U.S., he adds, a lot of Canadian processors would probably open facilities here. Legalization would also help hemp food break out of its niche-market status. If it received “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the Food and Drug Administration, major brands would be less reluctant to use it. Until then, he says, Coca-Cola won’t put hemp milk in Odwalla Future Shakes, and we’re not likely to see hempseed Clif Bars. Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry, says Murphy. Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized in 1998. The nation’s production leaped to 35,000 acres in 1999 and plummeted to about 4,000 in 2001, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada’s main hemp-producing province. It soared to 48,000 acres in 2006 and fell to less than 10,000 two years later.",summarize the following text: ,"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp Hemp oil for biofuel is unlikely to be practical.

"I’m going to make a radical claim, well, actually it’s pretty widely accepted in the social sciences:  There is no “choice.”  This isn’t about the individual.  This is about systems of oppression and social structures that shape our behavior and limit what choices are available to us based on our social identity. If you are a young, thin, white woman advocating for Nonhuman Animals in a pornified, hyper-sexualized society, one choice stands out loud and clear: Get naked. It’s supposed to be empowering, and we think maybe it helps animals.
First, I’m not really sure why one has to feel sexually empowered when one is advocating against the torture and death of Nonhuman Animals. Why our movement is keen on making violence a turn on is a little disturbing. It probably speaks something to our tendency to juxtapose women with violence. The sexualization of violence against women and other feminized social groups like Nonhuman Animals is evidence to the rape culture we inhabit.
Aside that, however, “choice” is often thrown around as a means of deflecting critical thought at systems of oppression. If it’s all about your individual choice, only you are responsible, only you are to blame. Anyone who has a problem with that must be judging you as a person. So often our advocacy is framed as personal choice, an individual expression. If you aren’t vegan, that’s your “choice.” If you want to have sex with vegetables and have it filmed by PETA, that’s your “choice.” This is a co-optation of anti-oppression social activism in a neo-liberal structure of exploitation.
Neoliberalism is all about “freedom”: Freedom from government, freedom from regulation, freedom to buy, freedom to sell, freedom to reach your full potential, etc. It’s about individuals out for themselves. This is how capitalism thrives: many are free to do whatever they want in the name of open markets, but ultimately, that freedom comes at a cost to those who will inevitably be exploited to pay for that “freedom.” The ideology of neoliberalism and individualism works to benefit the privileged when individuals can attribute their success to their own individual hard work (when in reality they had extensive help from their race, gender, class, physical ability, etc.). It also works to blame those less fortunate for their failure. We call them lazy, stupid, leeches (when in reality they had extensive barriers placed upon them according to their race, gender, class, physical ability, etc.).
This myth of freedom and meritocracy is actually pretty toxic for social movements. If we fail to recognize how structural barriers impede some, while structural privileges benefit others, we will find it difficult to come together as a political collective. When we soak in this neoliberal poison and start to view social movements–inherently collective endeavors designed to challenge unequal power structures–as something done by the individual, for the individual, we’ve lost the fight right off the bat.",summarize the following text: ,"There is no “choice.”  This isn’t about the individual.

The second feature of commodification is that it reduces bonds with other human beings to formal covenants; it moves ""relationships"" into the territory of ""contracts,"" in a parallel way to which ""persons"" become ""things"" and are for sale relationships between people enter the market place. A view in which relationships are for sale runs counter to most philosophical accounts of persons, and most especially to those where individuals are intrinsically social beings, embedded in complex relations with others, as philosophers such as Aristotle (2004), Taylor (1992), and Sandel (1998) have argued. In the market, however, according to Marx (1844), workers are alienated (to maximize profits), not just from their labor, and its products, but from others, such that the market converts relationships between [humans] to relationships between property owners. Taking this as a whole, to commodify, is to de-emhasize that individuals are, constitutively, relational beings and have interdependent ties to others and particular needs and wants, and instead is to shift toward seeing the connections between individuals as interchangeable, established and disestablished as the market requires, and valued only in extrinsic monetary terms. That is ""relationships"" between individuals become mere services for ""contracts ' Importantly, for both elements of commodification, It need not be the case that in fact happening to qualify as commodificatory. What matters is how persons and relationships are regarded; if they are treated (through language or conception, for instance) as being objects where trade could legiti- mately occur, then commodification has occurred. That is, moving from ""persons' to ""things"" and ""relationships"" to ""contracts,"" ""includes not only actual buying and selling, but also market rhetoric, the practice of thinking about interactions as if they were sale transactions"" (Radin, 1987, 1859, original emphasis). Though one may not partake in buying and selling of body parts or services, for instance, engaging in the view that they could be bought and sold is itself to endorse a commodificatory shift; it is to treat something which is not a ""thing"" or subjectable to ""contract"" as if it were. Thus, it is not only the act but the ""social practice for treating things as commodities, i.e. as properties that can be bought, sold, or rented"" (Resnik, 1998, p. 388) which amounts to commodification. This section sought to provide a working definition of commodification. It has stated that commodification is the (actual or implied) transformation of: first ""persons"" into ""things,"" and second ""relationships"" into ""contracts.""",summarize the following text: ,"commodification  reduces bonds with other human beings to formal covenants it moves ""relationships"" into the territory of ""contracts, in a parallel way to which ""persons"" become ""things"" and are for sale In the market workers are alienated (to maximize profits), not just from their labor but from others the market converts relationships between humans] to relationships between property owners to commodify, is to de-emhasize that individuals are beings and have interdependent ties to others and instead is to shift toward seeing connections between individuals as the market requires and valued only in extrinsic monetary terms relationships"" between individuals become mere services for ""contracts moving from ""persons' to ""things includes not only actual buying and selling, but also market rhetoric, the practice of thinking about interactions as if they were sale transactions Though one may not partake in buying and selling of body parts or services engaging in the view that they could be bought and sold is itself to endorse a commodificatory shift it is not only the act but the ""social practice for treating things as commodities, i.e. as properties that can be bought, sold, or rented"

This is because such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which, as Agamben points out, renders us all now homines sacri or bare life.¶ Taking Agamben’s conclusion on board, we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge. Agamben puts it in terms of a transformation:¶ This biopolitical body that is bare life must itself instead be transformed into the site for the constitution and installation of a form of life that is wholly exhausted in bare life and a bios that is only its own zoe-.... If we give the name form-of-life to this being that is only its own bare existence and to this life that, being its own form, remains inseparable from it we will witness the emergence of a field of research beyond the terrain defined by the intersection of politics and philosophy, medico-biological sciences and jurisprudence.60",summarize the following text: ,"One potential form of challenge to sovereign power consists of a refusal to draw any lines between zoe- and bios, inside and outside sovereign power does not involve a power relation . It is more appropriately considered to have become a form of governance or technique of administration through relationships of violence that reduce political subjects to mere bare or naked life In asking for a refusal to draw lines as a possibility of challenge we are not asking for the elimination of power relations and consequently, we are not asking for the erasure of the possibility of a mode of political being that is empowered and empowering, is free and that speaks: quite the opposite it is only through a refusal to draw any lines at all between forms of life (and indeed, nothing less will do) that sovereign power as a form of violence can be contested and a properly political power relation reinstated We could call this challenging the logic of sovereign power through refusal we can evade sovereign power and reinstate a form of power relation by contesting sovereign power’s assumption of the right to draw lines, that is, by contesting the sovereign ban Any other challenge always inevitably remains within this relationship of violence we need not only to contest its right to draw lines in particular places, but also to resist the call to draw any lines of the sort sovereign power demands.¶ The grammar of sovereign power cannot be resisted by challenging or fighting over where the lines are drawn Whilst this is a strategy that can be deployed, it is not a challenge to sovereign power per se as it still tacitly or even explicitly accepts that lines must be drawn somewhere (and preferably more inclusively) such strategies contest the violence of sovereign power’s drawing of a particular line, they risk replicating such violence in demanding the line be drawn differently such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which renders us all now homines sacri or bare life we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge.

"Policy Details The actual outcomes of any scheme of legal access would depend strongly on details rarely mentioned in the abstract pro-and-con discussion of whether to legalise. The risk of a large increase in damaging forms of consumption would be greater at a lower price; the need for enforcement against illicit production and sale, or tax evasion by licensed producers and sellers, would be higher. Another central decision is whether to allow private for-profit enterprises to produce and sell cannabis, or instead to restrict licit activity to: (1) Production for personal use and free distribution only. (2) Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises such as consumer-owned cooperatives like the Spanish ‘cannabis clubs’ (3) Some variety of state monopoly, perhaps of retail sales only, leaving production to private enterprise. If the private enterprise model is chosen, an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration to ensure the existence of a variety of competing firms (thus perhaps limiting the marketing and political power of the industry as a whole and – again perhaps – increasing the rate of product innovation and the range of products easily available) or instead to allow the likely development of oligopolistic competition, as in the markets for cigarettes and beer. A potential advantage of legalisation would be the provision of consumer information superior to that available on the illicit market. The corresponding disadvantage might be the application of powerful marketing techniques to making excessive consumption seem desirable and fashionable. Cannabis is a more complex product than beer, with at least two and perhaps dozens of significantly psychoactive chemicals and, to date, only limited scientific knowledge about their actions and interactions. Requiring accurate label information about chemical content seems a sensible approach, but not all consumers will be able to make good use of a collection of chemical names and percentages. Industry participants could be given the responsibility of providing sound consumer information, including due warnings about the risks of habituation, at the point of sale or via websites, or that responsibility could be assigned to NGOs or public agencies, perhaps financed by cannabis taxation. It seems at least arguable that cannabis sales personnel should have extensive training both about the pharmacology of the drug and about offering good advice to consumers, making their role closer to that of a pharmacist or nutritionist than of a mere sales clerk or bartender. By the same token, decisions would have to be made and executed about whether and how to limit marketing efforts. To some eyes at least, the alcohol industry provides a warning by example of what could go wrong. In the United States, the doctrine of ‘commercial free speech’ might gravely impair the capacity of the state to allow private enterprise but restrain promotion.",summarize the following text: ,Policy Details The actual outcomes of any scheme of legal access would depend strongly on details rarely mentioned in the abstract pro-and-con discussion of whether to legalise A central decision is whether to allow private enterprises or restrict licit activity to Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises Some variety of state monopoly If the private enterprise model is chosen an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration or allow oligopolistic competition as in the markets for cigarettes and beer label information consumer information point of sale taxation sales training decisions have to be made about marketing
"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed. “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains. This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy. Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it. There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.” Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks. On the other hand, the hemp-food industry is “pretty well settled,” says Murphy. If hemp growing were legalized in the U.S., he adds, a lot of Canadian processors would probably open facilities here. Legalization would also help hemp food break out of its niche-market status. If it received “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the Food and Drug Administration, major brands would be less reluctant to use it. Until then, he says, Coca-Cola won’t put hemp milk in Odwalla Future Shakes, and we’re not likely to see hempseed Clif Bars. Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry, says Murphy. Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized in 1998. The nation’s production leaped to 35,000 acres in 1999 and plummeted to about 4,000 in 2001, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada’s main hemp-producing province. It soared to 48,000 acres in 2006 and fell to less than 10,000 two years later.",summarize the following text: ,"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it.

In addition, Snyder's commentary includes a fundamentally Western concept: that spirituality is a universal, objective thing that all humans can experience equally, in an individual fashion. For example, Christianity often speaks of a ""personal relationship with Jesus."" Since in Western cultures, spirituality is woven almost exclusively into religion, Westerners have the concept of a ""one true way."" Indeed, if such a thing existed, it would be inhuman to deny that knowledge to all people; however, Indian spirituality is not based on the individual but rather on the community. Spiritual ties are completely dependent on the local culture and taken outside that cultural context, lose their meaning. There is no single ""Indian spirituality"" but each community would develop its own culturally-dependant ties to the spirit world. In this light, adopting Indian spirituality in a Western culture (or any culture outside of where it was created) is not only cultural theft, but also simply nonsensical. It would be like stealing a bottle of spice from a master chef and believing that you then had the secret to greatcooking. Looking closely at the Western mindset at the root of this issue in Going Native, Huhndorf writes: In New Age practices, ‘Native’ traditions generally reflect a heavily European ethos. In this particular case, the fixation on self-discovery and self-healing 9 articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism. At the same time, the teacher’s selling of ‘Indian’ knowledge and experiences manifests a profoundly capitalist mindset. . . Because it distorts Native traditions and turns them into consumer goods, the New Age represents another, newer phase in European America’s colonization of Native America. This is true despite the movement’s claims to have freed itself from this troubling history. In fact, New Agers’ desire to go native reproduces, even as it extends, the history of colonization, shown in this case by the compulsion to own Native cultures and even Native identities (Hundorf 2001). It is not surprising, given this information to learn that the predominant market for New Age Indian spirituality is middle class, white and wanting to escape modernity’s ills via individual transformation (rather than political action) and the only way they know how to do this is as Aldred says, “through commercialization and purchase. This cycle does not end their alienation. They are still so removed from any recognition of social relations (much less historical conflict) that they cannot understand why Native American peoples themselves would object to their appropriations” (Aldred 2000).",summarize the following text: ,"Indian spirituality is not based on the individual but rather on the community.

"Within the legal order the relations between individuals will resemble this logic where suffering is exchanged for more, but ‘legal’ suffering, because these relations are no longer regulated by the “culture of the heart” [Kultur des Herzens]. (CV 245) As Benjamin describes it, the “legal system tries to erect, in all areas where individual ends could be usefully pursued by violence, legal ends that can be realized only by legal power.” (CV  238) The individual is not to take law in his own hands; no conflict should be susceptible of being solved without the direct intervention of law, lest its authority will be undermined. Law has to present itself as indispensable for any kind of conflict to be solved. The consequence of this infiltration of law throughout the whole of human life is paradoxical:  the more inescapable the rule of law is, the less responsible the individual becomes.

The Asia-Pacific region can be regarded as a zone of both relative insecurity and strategic stability. It contains some of the world’s most significant flashpoints – the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the Siachen Glacier – where tensions between nations could escalate to the point of major war. It is replete with unresolved border issues; is a breeding ground for transnationa terrorism and the site of many terrorist activities (the Bali bombings, the Manila superferry bombing); and contains overlapping claims for maritime territories (the Spratly Islands, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands) with considerable actual or potential wealth in resources such as oil, gas and fisheries. Finally, the Asia-Pacific is an area of strategic significance with many key sea lines of communication and important chokepoints. Yet despite all these potential crucibles of conflict, the Asia-Pacific, if not an area of serenity and calm, is certainly more stable than one might expect. To be sure, there are separatist movements and internal struggles, particularly with insurgencies, as in Thailand, the Philippines and Tibet. Since the resolution of the East Timor crisis, however, the region has been relatively free of open armed warfare. Separatism remains a challenge, but the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance, but its impact is contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearisation of the peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict any time soon, especially given recent Kuomintang Party victories in Taiwan and efforts by Taiwan and China to re-open informal channels of consultation as well as institutional relationships between organisations responsible for cross-strait relations. And while in Asia there is no strong supranational political entity like the European Union, there are many multilateral organisations and international initiatives dedicated to enhancing peace and stability, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. In Southeast Asia, countries are united in a common geopolitical and economic organisation – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – which is dedicated to peaceful economic, social and cultural development, and to the promotion of regional peace and stability. ASEAN has played a key role in conceiving and establishing broader regional institutions such as the East Asian Summit, ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and South Korea) and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

"It’s hard to believe that it has been a quarter of a century since Ronald Reagan began to dismantle the ideological wall that divided Europe. Harder still to believe that American politicians, Right and Left, are trying to resuscitate the Cold War -- or something hotter. Recent events in the Ukraine seem to be giving the citizens of Europe and America hot flashes of deja-vu.¶ At the tactical level, US policy has devolved to “regime change.” At the strategic level, US policy is simply incoherent, if not nihilistic; swapping corrupt oligarchs for neo-fascists or religious zealots. The logic for supporting recent coups have little to do with common sense -- or democracy. And with Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Egypt, and now the Ukraine, language needs to be coined to avoid words like coup.¶ By any other name, a coup is still a coup. And using a post-facto election to legitimize a coup is a little like putting a new hat on a dead cat. The Kerry/Obama team is giving subtlety and sovereignty bad names.¶ When Vladimir Putin, tongue in cheek, says there are no Russian troops in the Ukraine, he mocks John Kerry and Victoria Nuland who orchestrate dissidents in Maidan square, in some cases neo-fascists who did not get their way on the bail-out treaty with the EU. ¶ The auction for the Ukraine is now closed. The price doubled overnight, from 16 to 35 billion dollars and counting. Politicians break it, now the taxpayer gets to pay for it. Kerry is now offering to buy the next Ukrainian election too.¶ Speaking of elections, Europe and America might need referendums at home on future bailouts, foreign and domestic. The EU and US look like the “two broke girls” of Capitalism. Angela Merkel might be the only European politician with any jingle left in her jeans these days.¶ When Putin says he protects Crimean Russians, again with a sneer, he mocks Samantha Power’s, now Barak Obama’s, humanitarian interventions. The fast track to imperialism is paved with words like “humanitarian.”¶ When Russia sponsors a referendum in the Crimea, the Kremlin pre-empts, indeed ridicules, the EU sponsored presidential election to be orchestrated by Kiev in May 2014.¶ When demagogues like Hillary Clinton compare Russian behavior to Nazi Germany, she mocks Allied history and the sacrifice of 5 million Russians in WWII. Russian blood chits, we might add, that made the Allied victory over Nazis possible in 1945. ¶ The name of the game in the Crimea is not the Ukraine in any case.

"It is important to emphasize this: the tendency I am diagnosing is self-operating. It operates independently of the personal qualities of those in power.

No president in recent memory has shown such infinite patience for working out differences and reaching compromise. Rarely has the United States seen such dedication in a president to the civil sphere as the seat of deliberative representative democracy, to the point that he has even tried to play down that old standard, the politics of fear. And yet … he has been swept up. His return to the deliberative reason of traditional liberal democratic process has been a tragi-comic failure. Rarely has a president proven so painfully ineffectual. Rarely has the power of reason of State seemed so faint.

It's likely to prove indefinitely effective. It is likely to be Obama's most lasting ""contribution"". It is what makes the ""everything has changed"" of 9-11 just ""more of the same."" For the unforeseable future. Because the unforeseeable future is threat, and that puts us right back in the loop.
Please don't misunderstand this as appeal to a more effective return to the liberal-deliberative model. This path has been effectively short-circuited. The circuits are burned. They won't be rewired ever. The circularity of the future cause at the heart of preemption as a positive and productive power, as a force of history in its own right, has seen to that. All signs indicate that political legitimation has moved onto an affective footing, as permanently and unrefusably as the spectrum of politics has moved onto a war footing. A logic of war has become the logic of politics. There is likely no going back
If resistance is possible, it must engage in that full-spectrum battlespace that has become the space of life. This means engaging the operative logic of preemption on its own terrains. This in turn means, in the most literal sense, a struggle for the future (perhaps through practices of slowness, against the preemptive addiction to rapid response?). It also means engaging it on the level of affect: reclaiming legitimation in a different affective key.
Not the key of hope. Hope is more of a deferral of the present to the future than it is a way of bringing the future into the present according to a different operative logic. To hope is to look dreamy-eyed toward the future – cringingg with the halfacknowledged certainty that when the future comes, in this broken world, it will be enough to make you cry. The only way to keep up the spirit is to defer to the future again, eyes wet with hope all over again."
"On January 1, Colorado made history by becoming the first American state where marijuana can be purchased for recreational purposes, and in which marijuana is regulated from the seed to the actual sale of product. As attitudes in America begin to shift in favor of outright legalization, it increasingly seems possible that more states -- and eventually the entire country -- might follow. But what does this mean south of the border, where Mexican cartels make enormous profits by trafficking this illegal commodity? Given the nature of the illegal drug business, arriving at a precise figure is impossible. At times, the Office of National Drug Policy has said that as much as 60% of cartel profits come from the production and sale of marijuana. On the other hand, a 2010 RAND study estimated the percentage to be between 15 and 26 percent. More recently, research by the Mexican Institute of Competiveness released in October 2012 suggests that if only Washington, Colorado and Oregon legalized marijuana, then cartel profits would fall as much as 30 percent. Another variable which must be taken into account when analyzing the impact of legalization on the cartels is the nature of the organizations themselves. All of Mexico's criminal groups have a range of diverse business interests aside from marijuana, and most are considered poly-drug organizations, which make huge profits from methamphetamine, cocaine and other drugs. Some cartels, including the notorious Zetas, have gone beyond trafficking illicit goods and are now involved in prostitution, migrant smuggling, extortion, human trafficking, counterfeiting and oil theft. On its own, legalization would not be able to bring an end to the activities of these groups, but -- whatever the actual figure -- legalization would have a definite financial impact. By some accounts, legalization in Colorado kept $5 million from the hands of criminals the first week, much of which, if the US government is to be believed, would have gone to Mexican traffickers. The most immediate effect in Mexico would likely be felt in areas heavily involved in production, such as Michoacán or the ""Golden Triangle"" region that straddles Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua. Parts of this region are completely dominated by the cartels, who pay farmers to grow marijuana (and poppy, to a lesser extent). If the price of marijuana were to suddenly drop, the cartels that manage the production in that area would experience a significant decline in profits. Mexican analyst Alejandro Hope estimated that the Sinaloa Cartel stands to lose up to half of its profits from legalization in Colorado, Oregon and Washington alone. Much of the power of cartels in Mexico stems from their ability to corrupt local authorities and buy protection. Whatever the precise figure, any legislation that disrupts the flow of money into cartel coffers benefits the Mexican government by allowing it to focus their resources elsewhere.",summarize the following text: ,"it increasingly seems possible that more states -- and eventually the entire country -- might follow the Office of National Drug Policy has said that as much as 60% of cartel profits come from the production and sale of marijuana. legalization would have a definite financial impact The most immediate effect in Mexico would likely be felt in areas heavily involved in production, such as Michoacán or the ""Golden Triangle"" region that straddles Sinaloa, Durango and Chihuahua.

"The first unintended consequence of prohibition is that individuals are more likely to consume poisonous substances and overdose with the increase in drug prices. As the price of a given drug rises, it creates additional profit opportunities for those willing to enter the drug trade. Since the drug market is illegal, and therefore, conducted underground, quality control is reduced compared to ""above ground"" markets. Drug users have few means available to determine which drugs are ""pure"" and have no recourse should they purchase a substance of inferior quality. Further, the underground market allows for less information sharing about products and vendors because transactions take place secretly to avoid authorities. Consequently, more poor-quality drug products enter the market, which leads to a greater potential for poisoning and overdose.¶ The greater prevalence of poor-quality drugs is not the sole mechanism through which overdoses increase. The illegality of drug use generates unintended ""potency effects,"" which affect both the supply and demand sides of the drug market. On the supply side, prohibition results in drug dealers carrying and selling more potent drugs. Because drug laws increase the risk of selling low potency drugs, suppliers tend to substitute toward higher potency drugs. For example, under prohibition, suppliers prefer to transport cocaine, as compared to marijuana, because cocaine is more potent and therefore more valuable per unit.¶ On the demand side, drug prices are driven up by prohibition, which causes drug users to seek ""more bang for their buck."" That is, since the overall cost of obtaining drugs is higher, more potent drugs are relatively cheaper than ""weak"" drugs. Because drug users must act illegally to obtain drugs, they seek to maximize the satisfaction or ""high"" from each dollar spent. This dynamic manifests itself in [*1079] several ways. Drug users may switch from lower potency to higher potency within a given drug (for example, from marijuana with lower levels of THC to marijuana with higher levels of THC). Alternatively, drug users may switch from substances like marijuana to ""harder"" drugs like cocaine and heroin. Finally, drug users may employ more intense methods of drug use, such as injection.¶ Taking both sides of the market together, prohibition leads to a greater use of more potent substances, which increases the likelihood of overdose and drug-related death. Indeed, these effects may be seen in the rate of unintended overdose deaths in the United States. In 1971, two years before the creation of the DEA and the year President Nixon declared drugs to be a public menace, just over one death per 100,000 deaths was due to an overdose. n53 By the year 2007, over 27,500 people died as a result of a drug overdose, which translates to almost ten per 100,000 deaths. n54 Between 1990 and 2007 alone, overdose rates increased five-fold. n55 The most common sources of overdose deaths are higher potency drugs – mainly cocaine, heroin, and opioid painkillers. n56",summarize the following text: ,"The first unintended consequence of prohibition is that individuals are more likely to consume poisonous substances and overdose with the increase in drug prices.

"Other studies focused on the total U.S. market differ from the various state reports and provide a less favorable aggregate view of the potential market for hemp growers in the United States. Two studies, conducted by researchers at USDA and University of Wisconsin-Madison (UW-M), highlight some of the continued challenges facing U.S. hemp producers. For example, USDA’s study projected that U.S. hemp markets “are, and will likely remain, small, thin markets” and also cited “uncertainty about long-run demand for hemp products and the potential for oversupply” among possible downsides of potential future hemp production. Similarly, the UW-M study concluded that hemp production “is not likely to generate sizeable profits” and although hemp may be “slightly more profitable than traditional row crops” it is likely “less profitable than other specialty crops” due to the “current state of harvesting and processing technologies, which are quite labor intensive, and result in relatively high per unit costs.”26 The study highlights that U.S. hemp growers could be affected by competition from other world producers as well as by certain production limitations in the United States, including yield variability and lack of harvesting innovations and processing facilities in the United States, as well as difficulty transporting bulk hemp. The study further claims that most estimates of profitability from hemp production are highly speculative, and often do not include additional costs of growing hemp in a regulated market, such as the cost associated with “licensing, monitoring, and verification of commercial hemp.”27 A 2013 study by researchers at the University of Kentucky highlights some of the issues and challenges for that state’s growers, processors, and industry. The study predicts that in Kentucky, despite “showing some positive returns, under current market conditions, it does not appear that anticipated hemp returns will be large enough to entice Kentucky grain growers to shift out of grain production,” under most circumstances; also, “short run employment opportunities evolving from a new Kentucky hemp industry appear limited (perhaps dozens of new jobs, not 100s),” because of continued uncertainty in the industry.28 Overall, the study concludes there are many remaining unknowns and further analysis and production research is needed. Given the absence since the 1950s of any commercial and unrestricted hemp production in the United States, it is not possible to predict the potential market and employment effects of relaxing current restrictions on U.S. hemp production. While expanded market opportunities might exist in some states or localities if current restrictions on production are lifted, it is not possible to predict the potential for future retail sales or employment gains in the United States, either nationally or within certain states or regions. Limited information is available from previous market analyses that have been conducted by researchers at USDA and land grant universities and state agencies.29",summarize the following text: ,"Two studies highlight challenges facing U.S. hemp producers USDA’s study projected that U.S. hemp markets “are, and will likely remain, small, thin markets” and cited “uncertainty about long-run demand for hemp products and the potential for oversupply the UW-M study concluded that hemp production “is not likely to generate profits and although hemp may be “slightly more profitable than traditional row crops” it is likely “less profitable than other specialty crops” due to the “current state of harvesting and processing technologies which are quite labor intensive, and result in high per unit costs U.S. hemp growers could be affected by competition from other world producers as well as production limitations in the United States including yield variability and lack of harvesting innovations and processing facilities as well as difficulty transporting bulk hemp. estimates of profitability from hemp production are highly speculative, and often do not include additional costs of growing hemp in a regulated market, such as the cost associated with “licensing, monitoring, and verification of commercial hemp A 2013 study by the University of Kentucky predicts that under current market conditions, it does not appear that anticipated hemp returns will be large enough to entice grain growers to shift out of grain production,” short run employment opportunities from a hemp industry appear limited because of continued uncertainty in the industry.28 Overall, the study concludes there are many remaining unknowns and further analysis and production research is needed.

In April, 1979, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency released a report on the effects of nuclear war that concludes that, in a general nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, 25 to 100 million people would be killed.  This is approximately the same number of African people who died between 1492 and 1890 as a result of the African slave trade to the New World.  The same federal report also comments on the destruction of urban housing that would cause massive shortages after a nuclear war, as well as on the crops that would be lost, causing massive food shortages.  Of course, for people of color the world over, starvation is already a common problem, when, for example, a nation’s crops are grown for export rather than to feed its own people.  And the housing of people of color throughout the world’s urban areas is already blighted and inhumane:  families live in shacks, shanty towns, or on the streets; even in the urban areas of North America, the poor may live without heat or running water.   For people of color, the world as we knew it ended centuries ago.  Our world, with its own languages, customs and ways, ended.  And we are only now beginning to see with increasing clarity that our task is to reclaim that world, struggle for it, and rebuild it in our own image.  The “death culture” we live in has convinced many to be more concerned with death than with life, more willing to demonstrate for “survival at any cost” than to struggle for liberty and peace with dignity.  Nuclear disarmament becomes a safe issue when it is not linked to the daily and historic issues of racism, to the ways in which people of color continue to be murdered.  Acts of war, nuclear holocausts, and genocide have already been declared on our jobs, our housing, our schools, our families, and our lands. As women of color, we are warriors, not pacifists.  We must fight as a people on all fronts, or we will continue to die as a people.  We have fought in people’s wars in China, in Cuba, in Guinea-Bissau, and in such struggles as the civil rights movement, the women’s movement, and in countless daily encounters with landlords, welfare departments, and schools.

Advocates of decriminalization argue that the health of those in prostitution will be improved by decriminalization because otherwise women will not have access to health care. It is assumed that women will seek health care as soon as the stigma of arrest is removed from prostitution. If the stigma is removed, advocates argue, women will then file a complaint whenever they are abused, raped, or assaulted in prostitution. They assume that the complaint will be followed with a police response that treats women in prostitution with dignity and as ordinary citizens. Unfortunately, health care workers and police too often share the same contempt toward those in prostitution that others do. A former prostitute in NZ said to the Parliament: “This bill pro vides people like me. . . with some form of red ress [italics added], for the brutalisation that may happen.. .when you’re with a client and you have a knife pulled on you” (Georgina Beyer, speech, Wellington, NZ, June 26, 2003). The specific form of redress offered by the NZ decriminalization law was not described by the speaker, nor is it articulated in the law. The dilemma for the per son in prostitution is not that there is no legal redress for coercion, physical assault, and rape in the new law or in old laws. The dilemma is that in prostitution there is no avoiding sexual harass ment, sexual exploitation, rape, and acts that are the equivalent of torture. Decriminalization in NZ was promoted as a means of provid ing those in prostitution with legal redress against violent johns. However, prostituted women could already take legal action under existing laws but rarely did so. Explaining this situation, a NZ Prostitutes Collective member stated, “They don’t want to draw attention to themselves and what they’re doing” (Else, 2003, np.). Women in the Netherlands have expressed similar senti ments, even though prostitution has been legal there for many years. Their concern was the loss of anonymity that exists in legal prostitution. Once officially registered as prostitutes, Dutch women feared that this designation would pursue them for the rest of their lives. Despite the fact that if officially registered as prostitutes they would accrue pension funds, the women still pre ferred anonymity (Schippers, 2002). They wanted to leave prosti tution as quickly as possible with no legal record of having been in prostitution (Daley, 2001). Similarly, despite attempts to unionize women in Germany’s $16.5 billion legal prostitution industry, the women not only avoided unions, they avoided registering with the government and they continued to engage in illegal prostitu tion in part because they felt that the remote areas where prostitu tion is zoned put them at increased, not decreased, risk of physical danger (Taubitz, 2004).",summarize the following text: ,"Advocates argue health of those in prostitution will be improved because otherwise women will not have access to health care.

"This equivocal passage from Foucault explodes the possibilities for theorizing suicide. But what, I wonder, are Foucault’s specific motivations for entering this particular dialectic —what productive “distortions” or epistemic agitations do his observations provide to the discourse on selbstmord, or “self-murder”?  What use does Foucault make of caching these two critical sentences in Volume 1 of The History of Sexuality within a broader formulation of bio-power (a thing which, as we will see, is at once productive of and threatened by suicidality)? More precisely to the point: what are the implications for framing suicide as a kind of resistance vis-à-vis a technology of power that, in Foucault’s account, grows out of the seventeenth century? I contend that Foucault’s concern with suicide is allegoric. This is not to trivialize or understate the complexity of his diffuse consideration of the subject. What I mean here by allegoric is the sense that Walter Benjamin gives the term: a peculiarly methodological tool or turn used to explain a certain theory by reducing it to a specific, emblematic scenario. Foucault is interested in the intersticiality and peripherality which suicide embodies: a thing which operates “at the borders and in the interstices of power that was exercised over life” (HS 139). He is invested, moreover, in what discursively is yielded up by preserving the singularity of suicide as an event that, precisely because of its singularity, exceeds the regulative purview of biopower. But it is imperative that the consequential shortcomings of treating this matter “allegorically” (the likely deliberate disavowal of the bleakness and misery of real suicides) be resolved if a meaningful and engaged consideration of suicide is to be formed. This move, it seems, can only be accomplished by means of a complicity with “sociological analysis” in considering the question of how and under what pretenses to intervene in suicide. Indeed, if we accept Michael J. Cholbi’s provocative and convincing claim that there are situations in which suicide not only authorizes, but demands precisely the kind of coercive surveillance and brute interruption characteristic of the operations of biopower, we are forced also to acknowledge that Foucault’s theory of the suicidal astonishment needs some nuance. Additionally, in order to consider the broader question of the relationship between sovereignty and suicide I will look to an interview conducted by Elisabeth Roudinesco with Jacques Derrida, in which Derrida provides the possibility of thinking the death penalty as an event of disciplinary suicidalization. Derrida’s brief theorization—one might even call it an intimation—of the ways in which execution is made autodestruction, of the manner in which being condemned to death is discursively reformed into an event of taking one’s own life, is one which idiomatically exceeds the critical capacity of available theories and taxonomies of suicide, and will provide the primary means through which to consider a Derridean re-reading of biopolitics.",summarize the following text: ,"what are the implications for framing suicide as a kind of resistance Foucault’s concern with suicide is allegoric a peculiarly methodological tool used to explain a certain theory by reducing it to a specific, emblematic scenario He is invested in what discursively is yielded up by preserving the singularity of suicide as an event that exceeds the regulative purview of biopower it is imperative that the consequential shortcomings of treating this matter “allegorically” (the likely deliberate disavowal of the bleakness and misery of real suicides be resolved if a meaningful and engaged consideration of suicide is to be formed there are situations in which suicide not only authorizes, but demands precisely the kind of coercive surveillance and brute interruption characteristic of the operations of biopower Foucault’s theory of the suicidal astonishment needs some nuance"
"Two days before Christmas in 2011, President Obama gave an unexpected gift to the states. n1 With a thirteen-page legal memorandum (""Memorandum""), the Obama Administration reversed an aggressive, decades-old Department of Justice (""DOJ"") position and opened the door for states to legalize almost every form of Internet gambling without interference from federal laws. n2 Through the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (""OLC""), the Obama Administration announced that the major federal anti-gambling statute, the Wire Act, n3 now applies only to bets on sports events and races. By issuing a clear interpretation of previously vague and inconsistent federal gambling laws, the Executive Branch maneuvered what Congress could not: it turned oversight of Internet gambling operations over to states.
The impacts of land-based casino gambling are long debated, n4 but Internet gaming is a recently developed industry. Opponents have compared online gambling to crack cocaine, n5 but it has also been described  [*656]  as inevitable and unstoppable. n6 Americans have made Internet bets in the hundreds of millions of dollars to the benefit of offshore illegal and gray market operations. n7 President Obama's Christmas Memorandum was a gift to states worth billions of dollars in new tax revenue and thousands of new jobs. After this thirteen-page reversal, expect a quick departure to uncharted territory for the United States: legal Internet gambling.
Part II of this Article explains the complicated, interlocked set of federal gaming laws at issue. These laws are critical to federal enforcement of state gambling laws and to federal involvement in states' decisions about what forms of gambling they might want to regulate. The law addressed in the Memorandum, the Wire Act, was the most important weapon the DOJ used to prevent states from authorizing Internet gambling, but it is not the only federal barrier to state-authorized gambling.
Part III discusses the tension among these federal laws, which at times undermine and contradict one another. With no legislative solution in sight, the Memorandum offers a clean solution and interprets the law to eliminate most, though not all, of the problems.
Part IV explores the explosion of Internet gambling, which is soon to be legalized by the states. The debate about Internet gambling has now been pushed to cash-strapped state authorities, allowing them to make their own decisions. This major change in federal law will advance the current wave of legalized gambling, which already encompasses all but two states. Internet gambling has the potential to spread pervasively with state cooperation. State legislators and governors are desperate to find ways to raise revenue without raising taxes.

"Waltz writes that ""policymakers and citizens in the Arab world, Europe, Israel, and the United States should take comfort from the fact that history has shown that where nuclear capabilities emerge, so, too, does stability."" In fact, the historical record suggests that competition between a nuclear-armed Iran and its principal adversaries would likely follow the pattern known as ""the stability-instability paradox,"" in which the supposed stability created by mutually assured destruction generates greater instability by making provocations, disputes, and conflict below the nuclear threshold seem safe. During the Cold War, for example, nuclear deterrence prevented large-scale conventional or nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the same time, however, the superpowers experienced several direct crises and faced off in a series of bloody proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and elsewhere. A recent statistical analysis by the political scientist Michael Horowitz demonstrated that inexperienced nuclear powers tend to be more crisis-prone than other types of states, and research by another political scientist, Robert Rauchhaus, has found that nuclear states are more likely to engage in low-level militarized disputes with one another, even if they are less likely to engage in full-scale war. If deterrence operates the way Waltz expects it to, a nuclear-armed Iran might reduce the risk of a major conventional war among Middle Eastern states. But history suggests that Tehran's development of nuclear weapons would encourage Iranian adventurism, leading to more frequent and intense crises in the Middle East. Such crises would entail some inherent risk of a nuclear exchange resulting from a miscalculation, an accident, or an unauthorized use -- a risk that currently does not exist at all. The threat would be particularly high in the initial period after Iran joined the nuclear club. Once the superpowers reached rough nuclear parity during the Cold War, for example, the number of direct crises decreased, and the associated risks of nuclear escalation abated. But during the early years of the Cold War, the superpowers were involved in several crises, and on at least one occasion -- the 1962 Cuban missile crisis -- they came perilously close to nuclear war. Similarly, a stable deterrent relationship between Iran, on the one hand, and the United States and Israel, on the other, would likely emerge over time, but the initial crisis-prone years would be hair-raising. Although all sides would have a profound interest in not allowing events to spiral out of control, the residual risk of inadvertent escalation stemming from decades of distrust and hostility, the absence of direct lines of communication, and organizational mistakes would be nontrivial -- and the consequences of even a low-probability outcome could be devastating.",summarize the following text: ,"historical record suggests that competition between a nuclear-armed Iran and its principal adversaries would likely follow the pattern known as ""the stability-instability paradox,"" A recent statistical analysis by Horowitz demonstrated that inexperienced nuclear powers tend to be more crisis-prone than other types of states, history suggests that Tehran's development of nuclear weapons would encourage Iranian adventurism, leading to more frequent and intense crises in the Middle East.

"7. A policy that favors preventive warfare expresses a futile quest for absolute security. It could do so. Most controversial policies contain within them the possibility of misuse. In the hands of a paranoid or boundlessly ambitious political leader, prevention could be a policy for endless warfare. However, the American political system, with its checks and balances, was designed explicitly for the purpose of constraining the executive from excessive folly. Both the Vietnam and the contemporary Iraqi experiences reveal clearly that although the conduct of war is an executive prerogative, in practice that authority is disciplined by public attitudes. Clausewitz made this point superbly with his designation of the passion, the sentiments, of the people as a vital component of his trinitarian theory of war. 51 It is true to claim that power can be, and indeed is often, abused, both personally and nationally. It is possible that a state could acquire a taste for the apparent swift decisiveness of preventive warfare and overuse the option. One might argue that the easy success achieved against Taliban Afghanistan in 2001, provided fuel for the urge to seek a similarly rapid success against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. In other words, the delights of military success can be habit forming. On balance, claim seven is not persuasive, though it certainly contains a germ of truth. A country with unmatched wealth and power, unused to physical insecurity at home—notwithstanding 42 years of nuclear danger, and a high level of gun crime—is vulnerable to demands for policies that supposedly can restore security. But we ought not to endorse the argument that the United States should eschew the preventive war option because it could lead to a futile, endless search for absolute security. One might as well argue that the United States should adopt a defense policy and develop capabilities shaped strictly for homeland security approached in a narrowly geographical sense. Since a president might misuse a military instrument that had a global reach, why not deny the White House even the possibility of such misuse? In other words, constrain policy ends by limiting policy’s military means. This argument has circulated for many decades and, it must be admitted, it does have a certain elementary logic. It is the opinion of this enquiry, however, that the claim that a policy which includes the preventive option might lead to a search for total security is not at all convincing. Of course, folly in high places is always possible, which is one of the many reasons why popular democracy is the superior form of government. It would be absurd to permit the fear of a futile and dangerous quest for absolute security to preclude prevention as a policy option. Despite its absurdity, this rhetorical charge against prevention is a stock favorite among prevention’s critics. It should be recognized and dismissed for what it is, a debating point with little pragmatic merit. And strategy, though not always policy, must be nothing if not pragmatic.",summarize the following text: ,"In the hands of a paranoid political leader, prevention could be a policy for endless warfare.

"Remote gambling is fundamentally different from brick-and-mortar casino gambling because the website operator never has complete control.

Gregg Harper, R-Miss., witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online.

"(Micahel, “The Securitization of climate change and the power of conceptions of security” ISA Convention Paper)
In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it is difficult  to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem (Brock  1997, Waever 1995). Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ in dealing  with the issue as well as to a shift in institutional localization towards ‘security experts’ (Bigot  2006), such as the military and police. Methods and instruments associated with these security  organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the  discourse on ‘what to do’. A good example of securitization was the period leading to the  Cold War (Guzzini 2004 ). Originally a political conflict over the organization of societies, in  the late 1940s, the East-West confrontation became an existential conflict that was  overwhelmingly addressed with military means, including the potential annihilation of  humankind. Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout most of the Cold War,  secondary to improving military capabilities. Climate change could meet a similar fate. An essentially political problem concerning the  distribution of the costs of prevention and adaptation and the losses and gains in income  arising from change in the human environment might be perceived as intractable, thus  necessitating the build-up of military and police forces to prevent it from becoming a major  security problem. The portrayal of climate change as a security problem could, in particular,  cause the richer countries in the global North, which are less affected by it, to strengthen  measures aimed at protecting them from the spillover of violent conflict from the poorer  countries in the global South that will be most affected by climate change. It could also be  used by major powers as a justification for improving their military preparedness against the  other major powers, thus leading to arms races. This kind of reaction to climate change would be counterproductive in various ways. Firstly,  since more border protection, as well as more soldiers and arms, is expensive, the financial means compensate for the negative economic effects of reducing greenhouse gas emission  and adapting to climate change will be reduced. Global military expenditure is again at the  level of the height of the Cold War in real terms, reaching more than US $1,200 billion in  2006 or 3.5 percent of global income. While any estimate of the costs of mitigation (e.g. of  restricting global warming to 2°C by 2050) and adaptation are speculative at the moment,1  they are likely to be substantial. While there is no necessary link between higher military  expenditures and a lower willingness to spend on preventing and preparing for climate  change, both policy areas are in competition for scarce resources.",summarize the following text: ,"(Micahel, “The Securitization of climate change and the power of conceptions of security” ISA Convention Paper)

"THE doomsayers' published assessments tell the grim story: upwards of 12 million people killed on the first day of a nuclear exchange, more than 150 million dead in a longer nuclear conflict.  Devastation and destruction on a scale that is almost unimaginable. A catastrophe that would vastly transcend that seen at Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II.  That is why, as India and Pakistan muscle up to each other after the Mumbai massacre and leaders from across the world hurry to counsel cool heads and caution in New Delhi and Islamabad, the unspoken fear everywhere is that the two South Asian neighbours could be pushed into the unthinkable: their fourth war, and one in which they would mobilise their nuclear arsenals.  It is, it must be said, an unlikely prospect. No one in either capital -- even among the hotheads -- is thinking in those terms. Experienced strategic analysts rule it out.  ""Don't even think about it. It ain't going to happen,"" one says.  But as the crisis over terrorism across South Asia deepens and jihadist groups linked to al-Qa'ida launch devastating attacks such as the one in Mumbai last week -- attacks designed to exacerbate tensions between India and Pakistan -- there is, in the view of most analysts, always the potential for events to tumble out of control and lead to a doomsday nuclear conflagration, with enormous loss of life.  ""South Asia's a nuclear tinderbox,"" a leading military analyst in New Delhi tells The Australian. ""Yes, of course, I'd just about rule it out in the context of the face-off following the Mumbai attack.  ""But it's always there, always nagging at the edges of the constant tensions in the subcontinent. And there's no doubt that Osama (bin Laden) is doing his bit to stir the pot and do what he can to increase those tensions, since conflict between India and Pakistan serves the jihadist cause.""  Yesterday, US military officials in Washington, DC, closely monitoring the situation described the military temperature between the two neighbours as ""pretty low right now"", adding that although Pakistan has moved some aircraft and air defence units closer to the Indian border since the Mumbai attack, ""on the nuclear side there is nothing"". Which is hardly surprising, for the political will in both sides, despite the muscle-flexing, is overwhelmingly against resort to their nuclear arsenals.  India, since it demonstrated its nuclear capability in 1998, has maintained a firm no-first-strike policy and a few days ago Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari turned longstanding Pakistani policy on its head (some believe to the annoyance of the country's powerful generals) by articulating a similar stance.  On both sides there is a mood of extreme caution on the subject of any possible use of nuclear weapons, matched only by the intense secrecy that surrounds their arsenals.

"In many respects the WTO system is better than the old GATT system. It included all the GATT provisions plus improved by adding new Agreements covering key sectors and issues of international trade. Yet, two out of six Ministerial Conferences of the WTO completely failed as the countries at the negotiation table could not reach any agreeable solution.20 In addition, although the Doha Conference produced promising Doha Development Agenda (DDA), the commitments laid in the DDA have not yet been fulfilled. This paper assumes that the success of a multilateral trade negotiation depends on the power of the DSU to provide remedies against unfair trade practices,2 because if the remedial measures are not effective then it will induce violation of commitments. As a result, deadlocks in trade negotiations will fail the purpose of the Ministerial Conference. Examining the provisions of the DSU, this paper finds that it has considerable insufficiencies. Because of the insufficiencies it is practically very difficult for a country, especially for the small-developing ones, to get adequate relief against unfair trade practices. The provisions of the DSU only allow retaliatory measures against a country using unfair trade practices. If a small-developing country is affected by such unfair trade practices used by a developed country, then it is virtually impossible for that small-developing country to “retaliate” against the developed country, because in reality most of the developing countries are heavily dependent on few developed countries/regions, for example, to sell their exportable items. Our regression analyses show that the countries with considerable financial strength, versatile tradable items and large trade share not only tend to use the dispute settlement mechanism more but also win more disputes than the countries with low financial strength and small trade share. In addition, we also find that if a dispute is prolonged then it may favor the developed countries at the expense of the small-developing ones. These results provide logic for the empirical finding that the developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, participate in fewer trade disputes than the developed countries.21 Apparently the WTO does not have anything to do with the financial strength or the trade share of a country. However, the gap of financial power between the developed and the developing countries may be neutralized by providing the latter with intensified legal and technical assistance during the litigation process of a dispute. To encourage the developing countries to participate more in the dispute settlement process, the WTO should replace the provision of retaliation by introducing more meaningful measure, such as financial compensation instead of retaliation, in the system. 22 At the same time, the WTO should also take necessary steps to resolve the disputed matters within the time-frame stipulated in the DSU. Without these changes and actions the WTO will always face difficulty ensuring fare trade and successful multilateral trade negotiations.",summarize the following text: ,"two out of six Ministerial Conferences of the WTO completely failed as the countries at the negotiation table could not reach any agreeable solution the success of a multilateral trade negotiation depends on the power of the DSU to provide remedies against unfair trade practices Examining the provisions of the DSU it has considerable insufficiencies Because of the insufficiencies it is very difficult for a country, especially for the small-developing ones, to get adequate relief against unfair trade practices The provisions of the DSU only allow retaliatory measures against a country using unfair trade practices If a small-developing country is affected by such unfair trade practices it is impossible for that small-developing country to “retaliate against the developed country, because in reality most of the developing countries are heavily dependent on few developed countries the countries with considerable financial strength, versatile tradable items and large trade share not only tend to use the dispute settlement mechanism more but win more disputes than the countries with low financial strength if a dispute is prolonged then it may favor the developed countries at the expense of the small-developing ones.

"This equivocal passage from Foucault explodes the possibilities for theorizing suicide. But what, I wonder, are Foucault’s specific motivations for entering this particular dialectic —what productive “distortions” or epistemic agitations do his observations provide to the discourse on selbstmord, or “self-murder”?  What use does Foucault make of caching these two critical sentences in Volume 1 of The History of Sexuality within a broader formulation of bio-power (a thing which, as we will see, is at once productive of and threatened by suicidality)? More precisely to the point: what are the implications for framing suicide as a kind of resistance vis-à-vis a technology of power that, in Foucault’s account, grows out of the seventeenth century? I contend that Foucault’s concern with suicide is allegoric. This is not to trivialize or understate the complexity of his diffuse consideration of the subject. What I mean here by allegoric is the sense that Walter Benjamin gives the term: a peculiarly methodological tool or turn used to explain a certain theory by reducing it to a specific, emblematic scenario. Foucault is interested in the intersticiality and peripherality which suicide embodies: a thing which operates “at the borders and in the interstices of power that was exercised over life” (HS 139). He is invested, moreover, in what discursively is yielded up by preserving the singularity of suicide as an event that, precisely because of its singularity, exceeds the regulative purview of biopower. But it is imperative that the consequential shortcomings of treating this matter “allegorically” (the likely deliberate disavowal of the bleakness and misery of real suicides) be resolved if a meaningful and engaged consideration of suicide is to be formed. This move, it seems, can only be accomplished by means of a complicity with “sociological analysis” in considering the question of how and under what pretenses to intervene in suicide. Indeed, if we accept Michael J. Cholbi’s provocative and convincing claim that there are situations in which suicide not only authorizes, but demands precisely the kind of coercive surveillance and brute interruption characteristic of the operations of biopower, we are forced also to acknowledge that Foucault’s theory of the suicidal astonishment needs some nuance. Additionally, in order to consider the broader question of the relationship between sovereignty and suicide I will look to an interview conducted by Elisabeth Roudinesco with Jacques Derrida, in which Derrida provides the possibility of thinking the death penalty as an event of disciplinary suicidalization. Derrida’s brief theorization—one might even call it an intimation—of the ways in which execution is made autodestruction, of the manner in which being condemned to death is discursively reformed into an event of taking one’s own life, is one which idiomatically exceeds the critical capacity of available theories and taxonomies of suicide, and will provide the primary means through which to consider a Derridean re-reading of biopolitics.",summarize the following text: ,"what are the implications for framing suicide as a kind of resistance Foucault’s concern with suicide is allegoric a peculiarly methodological tool used to explain a certain theory by reducing it to a specific, emblematic scenario He is invested in what discursively is yielded up by preserving the singularity of suicide as an event that exceeds the regulative purview of biopower it is imperative that the consequential shortcomings of treating this matter “allegorically” (the likely deliberate disavowal of the bleakness and misery of real suicides be resolved if a meaningful and engaged consideration of suicide is to be formed there are situations in which suicide not only authorizes, but demands precisely the kind of coercive surveillance and brute interruption characteristic of the operations of biopower Foucault’s theory of the suicidal astonishment needs some nuance"

Gregg Harper, R-Miss., witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online. The Harper demonstration showed the technology and techniques that terror and crime organizations could use to operate untraceable money laundering built on a highly liquid legalized online poker industry — just the environment that will result from the spread of poker online. One of us set up a website — undetectablelaundering.com — to help communicate the problem to a broader audience. No one should doubt the ability of criminals to exploit the inherent weakness in online gambling. A drug cartel could arrange for buyers' machines to be remotely linked and lose to the aliased cartel machines. Drug buyers would not even need to play from their own machines. Illegal drug money would appear to be legal online winnings. A single poker game takes just a few hours to transfer $5 million as was recently demonstrated — legally — by American player Brian Hastings with his Swedish competitor half a world away. An established al-Qaida poker network could extract from the United States enough untraceable money in six days to fund an operation like the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. The threat is real. Last month a Texas lawyer was found guilty of trying to launder $600 million in drug money for a Mexican cartel. Caesar's Entertainment is currently under investigation by the Justice Department and IRS, accused of money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act violations. In December 2012, the FBI's Tampa field office asked us to take down the website explaining the threat. We complied. This May, special agents at FBI headquarters in Washington responsible for enforcing the Wire Act and all other federal gambling laws were briefed on the vulnerability. In July, a Senate Commerce Committee hearing seemed to reinforce concerns. Rep. C.W. Bill Young wrote a letter of concern to FBI director Robert Mueller on Aug. 7. But since then action seems to have stalled. And the threat moves on. With the passing of Young, we have put the website back up and joined together in hopes of spurring action. Since it remains true that gambling regulations in Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey are no match for determined terrorists and criminals, we feel duty-bound as responsible citizens to ensure knowledge of the threat reaches as many policymakers as possible. We have proved it is possible to make money laundering undetectable. Gambling should be firmly restricted to stay offline.",summarize the following text: ,"Remote gambling is fundamentally different from brick-and-mortar casino gambling Using tech undetectable to operators and regulators, House Commerce Committee witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online.

"Economists have a term for this disruption: an oil shock. The idea that such oil shocks will inevitably wreak havoc on the US economy has become deeply rooted in the American psyche, and in turn the United States has made ensuring the smooth flow of crude from the Middle East a central tenet of its foreign policy. Oil security is one of the primary reasons America has a long-term military presence in the region. Even aside from the Iraq and Afghan wars, we have equipment and forces positioned in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar; the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet is permanently stationed in Bahrain.  But a growing body of economic research suggests that this conventional view of oil shocks is wrong. The US economy is far less susceptible to interruptions in the oil supply than previously assumed, according to these studies. Scholars examining the recent history of oil disruptions have found the worldwide oil market to be remarkably adaptable and surprisingly quick at compensating for shortfalls. Economists have found that much of the damage once attributed to oil shocks can more persuasively be laid at the feet of bad government policies. The US economy, meanwhile, has become less dependent on Persian Gulf oil and less sensitive to changes in crude prices overall than it was in 1973.  These findings have led a few bold political scientists and foreign policy experts to start asking an uncomfortable question: If the United States could withstand a disruption in Persian Gulf oil supplies, why does it need a permanent military presence in the region at all? There’s a lot riding on that question: America’s presence in the Middle East exacts a heavy toll in political capital, financial resources, and lives. Washington’s support for Middle East autocrats makes America appear hypocritical on issues of human rights and democracy. The United States spends billions of dollars every year to maintain troops in the Middle East, and the troops risk their lives simply by being there, since they make tempting targets for the region’s Islamic extremists. And arguably, because the presence of these forces inflames radicals and delegitimizes local rulers, they may actually be undermining the very stability they are ostensibly there to ensure.  Among those asking this tough question are two young professors, Eugene Gholz, at the University of Texas, and Daryl Press, at Dartmouth College. To find out what actually happens when the world’s petroleum supply is interrupted, the duo analyzed every major oil disruption since 1973. The results, published in a recent issue of the journal Strategic Studies, showed that in almost all cases, the ensuing rise in prices, while sometimes steep, was short-lived and had little lasting economic impact. When there have been prolonged price rises, they found the cause to be panic on the part of oil purchasers rather than a supply shortage. When oil runs short, in other words, the market is usually adept at filling the gap.",summarize the following text: ,"The idea that such oil shocks will inevitably wreak havoc on the US economy has become deeply rooted in the American psyche But a growing body of economic research suggests that this conventional view of oil shocks is wrong.

"ARTICLE: BIO LAW: A FEW THOUGHTS ABOUT ALTRUISM AND MARKETS    lexis
At the center of these exchanges is the tremendous demand for human biological materials to save the terminally ill or enhance the quality of life for  [*213]  transplant recipients. The fight against a pronounced tissue and organ market obscures a sad reality: thousands of Americans unnecessarily die each year from treatable illnesses because organs are not available. Currently, there are over one hundred thousand Americans in need of organs. n20 A disproportionate number of these patients are black Americans desperately in need of kidney transplantation. They are caught in a strange confluence of inadequate supply and overwhelming demand, as black Americans account for more than one-third of kidney waitlist patients. n21 African Americans wait longer than all other racial and ethnic groups while on the transplantation list. n22 Moreover, they experience the highest rate of death on transplantation lists. n23 These dramatic disparities can be linked to the antigen distribution matching requirement, which is deemed essential and ascribed critical importance in the rationing process. n24 The unfortunate result has only recently been acknowledged as inequitable and biologically disadvantaging African Americans. n25 While some scholars criticize the organ distribution system in the United States, calling it illogical and even pernicious, because of its inequitable results in the health care of African Americans, few have recognized the role and potential advantages of market analysis to address the problem.
In prior scholarship, I warned that ""the consequences of ignoring the possible advantages of incentives for curing organ deficits and thereby enhancing the health opportunities for all Americans, especially Black Americans are extreme."" n26 This clarion call remains true; ""although organ donating by African Americans has increased in recent years, demand dramatically exceeds supply."" n27 Empirical studies documenting the high incidences of high blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension, stress, and other conditions affect African Americans at a disparate rate, and of most concern, these conditions contribute to widespread organ failure. n28
Until more organs become available for transplantation, Black patients will continue to experience the longest waits while on America's transplantation waitlists. Because they suffer the highest rate of mortality while on the transplantation waitlists this issue deserves urgent address. Finally, other health, political, and legal risks will undoubtedly emerge as desperate Americans in greater numbers seek life-saving transplantations outside of the United States from death row inmates in China and others in India, Brazil,  [*214]  Pakistan and other countries. How they receive their follow-up care may indeed become a political as well as medical issue.",summarize the following text: ,"Currently, there are over one hundred thousand in need of organs A disproportionate number of these patients are black They account for more than one-third of kidney waitlist patients African Americans wait longer than all other racial and ethnic groups while on the transplantation list. they experience the highest rate of death on transplantation lists.

"C. The Money Drain from Minority Communities Much is made by the proponents of marijuana legalization concerning marijuana’s potential to become the next ""cash crop"" creating billions of dollars in both sales and tax revenue.135 Particularly in the face of decriminalization proposals, which do nothing to divert money from the hands of drug dealers, legalization makes sense. The argument goes something like this: as history has shown, marijuana use will not stop; therefore, we might as well sell the drug legally, putting the money from drug dealers’ wallets into those of the people.136 Although this is generally a sound and sensible argument, for minority groups it might truthfully represent another tool of economic oppression bogging down their communities. In the illegal market, high-quality marijuana costs, on average, over $4,000 per pound, while lower level marijuana nears $1,000 per pound.137 As noted earlier, marijuana sales in the United States, top $100 billion annually.138 As also noted, the highest concentration of drug dealers is found in lower income, urban environments prone to minority dwelling.139 These figures tend to reflect that billions, and at the very least hundreds of millions, of dollars are funneled into such lower income communities each year. With the legalization of marijuana, money expended by consumers will be the same or higher, but minorities must ask where that money will drain. Meaning, will the billions or hundreds of millions of dollars continue their current flow into lower income communities, or will forces divert the money elsewhere? The California initiative created licensing regulations for both the growing140 and the selling141 of marijuana. To the detriment of minorities, these licensing requirements required both money and a certain amount of business prowess: cultivating or growing marijuana would require 1) a maximum license fee of $5,000 paid by all applicants to ""reasonably cover the costs of assuring compliance with the regulations to be issued"";142 2) all license applicants to submit to a criminal history background check;143 3) appropriate security and security plans with ""satisfactory proof of the financial ability of the licensee to provide for that security"";144 and 4) compliance with other employment,145 inspection,146 and recordkeeping147 measures. These business and licensing regulations provided no assistance to entrepreneurs with little or no start-up capital. Therefore, marijuana, if legalized in the California fashion, while becoming the nation’s next cash crop and a tremendous source of wealth, could potentially be so for mainly non-minorities, ones who have the financial means and business savvy to initiate such production. Worsening this dilemma, most of the money flowing into the minority communities from the illegal sale of marijuana would be diverted into the bank accounts of the new class of ""marijuana business[man].""148 Minority community leaders should be mindful of this potential money drain, and wary of its wide range of effects on their communities.149",summarize the following text: ,"legalization for minority groups might represent another tool of economic oppression bogging down their communities In the illegal market, high-quality marijuana costs, on average, over $4,000 per pound, while lower level marijuana nears $1,000 per pound. marijuana sales in the United States, top $100 billion annually the highest concentration of drug dealers is found in lower income, urban environments prone to minority dwelling billions of dollars are funneled into such lower income communities each year With the legalization of marijuana, money expended by consumers will be the same or higher, but minorities must ask where that money will drain The California initiative created licensing regulations for both the growing and selling of marijuana To the detriment of minorities, these licensing requirements required both money and a certain amount of business prowess cultivating marijuana would require a license fee all applicants to submit to a criminal history background check appropriate security and security plans with ""satisfactory proof of the financial ability of the licensee to provide for that security and compliance with other employment inspection and recordkeeping measures These business and licensing regulations provided no assistance to entrepreneurs with little or no start-up capital marijuana, if legalized while becoming the nation’s next cash crop and a tremendous source of wealth, could potentially be so for mainly non-minorities, ones who have the financial means and business savvy to initiate such production. most of the money flowing into the minority communities from the illegal sale of marijuana would be diverted into the bank accounts of the new class of ""marijuana business["
"Enlightenment thinkers wished neither to abolish the state nor to bring about some utopian alternative.

"Due to the pharmaceutical industry‘s capital and know- how intensity, most of the world‘s production is located in the developed countries. India is one of the few developing countries with a large production base in pharmaceutical products. India‘s trade in pharmaceutical products has increased a lot since the liberalization reforms and it has comparative advantages in trade with pharmaceutical products, both bulk drugs and formulations. The Indian pharmaceutical industry ranks very high among developing countries, in terms of technology and quality, and is today in the front rank of India‘s science based industries23 . The growth of the Indian pharmaceutical industry has been remarkable. The industry is today the fourth largest globally, in terms of volume, and 13 th largest in terms of value24. The industry accounts for 8% of the global sales in volume but in terms of value it is barely 1%. The role of the Indian pharmaceutical industry in the international market today is as a supplier of good quality, low cost generic bulk and formulation Potential growth of the Indian pharmaceutical industry is great. Nearly 65% of India‘s population does not enjoy comprehensive access to quality healthcare today. A large share of the population use alternative medicine and per capita consumption of drugs in India is one of the lowest in the world25 . Multinationals are, in addition to the public sector, a part of India‘s pharmaceutical foundation. Foreign companies entered the Indian market merely as trading companies with small investments. The new industrial policies emphasized the importance of foreign capital and industrial know- how. The Indian government carried out liberal FDI policies and incentives to invite foreign firms to start manufacturing facilities in order to get an inflow of know- how in the sector. The leading pharmaceutical companies from the West came to India and established manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, the multinationals brought in technology and international manufacturing practices26. Domestic firms were encouraged to tie up with foreign firms, with participation in capital, and there were collaboration agreements in the private sector. The foreign firm Hoechst established a research centre, which enhanced basic research in India27 . During this time product patent laws8, which were favourable for the MNCs, were in force India was attractive to foreign firms mainly due to its large market and increasing demand for drugs. At that time there was lack of competition in the Indian pharmaceutical industry and the MNCs did well in India. They had good knowledge and technology to develop antibiotics and synthetic drugs and advantage of their financial assets and management abilities. Consumer preference for foreign world- wide known drugs was also an advantage for the MNCs in India. They were aggressive in marketing and managed to create a market for themselves in branded products.

"Waltz writes that ""policymakers and citizens in the Arab world, Europe, Israel, and the United States should take comfort from the fact that history has shown that where nuclear capabilities emerge, so, too, does stability."" In fact, the historical record suggests that competition between a nuclear-armed Iran and its principal adversaries would likely follow the pattern known as ""the stability-instability paradox,"" in which the supposed stability created by mutually assured destruction generates greater instability by making provocations, disputes, and conflict below the nuclear threshold seem safe. During the Cold War, for example, nuclear deterrence prevented large-scale conventional or nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union. At the same time, however, the superpowers experienced several direct crises and faced off in a series of bloody proxy wars in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and elsewhere. A recent statistical analysis by the political scientist Michael Horowitz demonstrated that inexperienced nuclear powers tend to be more crisis-prone than other types of states, and research by another political scientist, Robert Rauchhaus, has found that nuclear states are more likely to engage in low-level militarized disputes with one another, even if they are less likely to engage in full-scale war. If deterrence operates the way Waltz expects it to, a nuclear-armed Iran might reduce the risk of a major conventional war among Middle Eastern states. But history suggests that Tehran's development of nuclear weapons would encourage Iranian adventurism, leading to more frequent and intense crises in the Middle East. Such crises would entail some inherent risk of a nuclear exchange resulting from a miscalculation, an accident, or an unauthorized use -- a risk that currently does not exist at all. The threat would be particularly high in the initial period after Iran joined the nuclear club. Once the superpowers reached rough nuclear parity during the Cold War, for example, the number of direct crises decreased, and the associated risks of nuclear escalation abated. But during the early years of the Cold War, the superpowers were involved in several crises, and on at least one occasion -- the 1962 Cuban missile crisis -- they came perilously close to nuclear war. Similarly, a stable deterrent relationship between Iran, on the one hand, and the United States and Israel, on the other, would likely emerge over time, but the initial crisis-prone years would be hair-raising. Although all sides would have a profound interest in not allowing events to spiral out of control, the residual risk of inadvertent escalation stemming from decades of distrust and hostility, the absence of direct lines of communication, and organizational mistakes would be nontrivial -- and the consequences of even a low-probability outcome could be devastating.",summarize the following text: ,"historical record suggests that competition between a nuclear-armed Iran and its principal adversaries would likely follow the pattern known as ""the stability-instability paradox,"" A recent statistical analysis by Horowitz demonstrated that inexperienced nuclear powers tend to be more crisis-prone than other types of states, history suggests that Tehran's development of nuclear weapons would encourage Iranian adventurism, leading to more frequent and intense crises in the Middle East.

"Most Americans have an image of Mexico as a nation convulsed by violent drug wars and sending hundreds of thousands of desperate immigrants across our southern border.¶ That image is out-of-date. The drug war has largely quieted down and scarcely affects most of the country while, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, net migration from Mexico to the United States since 2007 has fallen to zero.¶ What has been happening in Mexico recently is far more encouraging: the culmination of reforms that have been in train, but have been frustratingly delayed, for the last 25 years.¶ Some historical background is in order. For 71 years, Mexican politics and government was totally dominated by the paradoxically named Party of the Institutional Revolution, which held the presidency and virtually all governorships from 1929 to 2000.¶ Under the PRI system, presidents served one six-year term, and in their last year — usually a time of catastrophes — chose their successors, who paraded around the country and were elected without difficulty.¶ Once in office, the new president blamed all his problems on his predecessor, who often left the country. This system suited the sensibility of a nation whose culture is still at least partly Aztec: It combined elements of calendrical regularity, elaborate ceremony and human sacrifice.¶ This system worked tolerably well for 30-some years. But as time went on, it produced widespread corruption, periodic currency devaluations and massive out-migration. Mexico seemed to be falling further behind the U.S.¶ Reform began when the Machiavellian President Carlos Salinas, elected in 1988, started opening up its political process and was joined by Texans George H. W. Bush and Lloyd Bentsen in pushing successfully for the North American Free Trade Agreement. With support from Bill Clinton, Congress approved NAFTA in 1993.¶ Mexico reformed its electoral process in the 1990s, with key verification from exit poll pioneer Warren Mitofsky. PRI lost its congressional majorities in 1997, and in 2000, Vicente Fox of the center-right PAN party was elected president over the candidates of the PRI and the leftist PRD. In 2006, Fox was succeeded by the PAN’s Felipe Calderon.¶ But Fox and Calderon were unable to reform Mexico’s government-owned oil company Pemex or its dysfunctional union-dominated education system because of united congressional opposition by the PRI and PRD.¶ And they got sidetracked on other issues — Fox in responding to Zapatista protests, Calderon in waging war (with the army) on the drug lords.¶ In July 2012, Mexicans PRI returned to power with the election of Enrique Peña Nieto. He looked like a conventional politician: governor of the state that includes most Mexico City suburbs, movie star handsomely, a widower who was wooing a telenovela star.¶ But Peña has proved to be an effective reformer.

"7. A policy that favors preventive warfare expresses a futile quest for absolute security. It could do so. Most controversial policies contain within them the possibility of misuse. In the hands of a paranoid or boundlessly ambitious political leader, prevention could be a policy for endless warfare. However, the American political system, with its checks and balances, was designed explicitly for the purpose of constraining the executive from excessive folly. Both the Vietnam and the contemporary Iraqi experiences reveal clearly that although the conduct of war is an executive prerogative, in practice that authority is disciplined by public attitudes. Clausewitz made this point superbly with his designation of the passion, the sentiments, of the people as a vital component of his trinitarian theory of war. 51 It is true to claim that power can be, and indeed is often, abused, both personally and nationally. It is possible that a state could acquire a taste for the apparent swift decisiveness of preventive warfare and overuse the option. One might argue that the easy success achieved against Taliban Afghanistan in 2001, provided fuel for the urge to seek a similarly rapid success against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. In other words, the delights of military success can be habit forming. On balance, claim seven is not persuasive, though it certainly contains a germ of truth. A country with unmatched wealth and power, unused to physical insecurity at home—notwithstanding 42 years of nuclear danger, and a high level of gun crime—is vulnerable to demands for policies that supposedly can restore security. But we ought not to endorse the argument that the United States should eschew the preventive war option because it could lead to a futile, endless search for absolute security. One might as well argue that the United States should adopt a defense policy and develop capabilities shaped strictly for homeland security approached in a narrowly geographical sense. Since a president might misuse a military instrument that had a global reach, why not deny the White House even the possibility of such misuse? In other words, constrain policy ends by limiting policy’s military means. This argument has circulated for many decades and, it must be admitted, it does have a certain elementary logic. It is the opinion of this enquiry, however, that the claim that a policy which includes the preventive option might lead to a search for total security is not at all convincing. Of course, folly in high places is always possible, which is one of the many reasons why popular democracy is the superior form of government. It would be absurd to permit the fear of a futile and dangerous quest for absolute security to preclude prevention as a policy option. Despite its absurdity, this rhetorical charge against prevention is a stock favorite among prevention’s critics. It should be recognized and dismissed for what it is, a debating point with little pragmatic merit. And strategy, though not always policy, must be nothing if not pragmatic.",summarize the following text: ,"In the hands of a paranoid political leader, prevention could be a policy for endless warfare.

"Two days before Christmas in 2011, President Obama gave an unexpected gift to the states. n1 With a thirteen-page legal memorandum (""Memorandum""), the Obama Administration reversed an aggressive, decades-old Department of Justice (""DOJ"") position and opened the door for states to legalize almost every form of Internet gambling without interference from federal laws. n2 Through the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (""OLC""), the Obama Administration announced that the major federal anti-gambling statute, the Wire Act, n3 now applies only to bets on sports events and races. By issuing a clear interpretation of previously vague and inconsistent federal gambling laws, the Executive Branch maneuvered what Congress could not: it turned oversight of Internet gambling operations over to states.
The impacts of land-based casino gambling are long debated, n4 but Internet gaming is a recently developed industry. Opponents have compared online gambling to crack cocaine, n5 but it has also been described  [*656]  as inevitable and unstoppable. n6 Americans have made Internet bets in the hundreds of millions of dollars to the benefit of offshore illegal and gray market operations. n7 President Obama's Christmas Memorandum was a gift to states worth billions of dollars in new tax revenue and thousands of new jobs. After this thirteen-page reversal, expect a quick departure to uncharted territory for the United States: legal Internet gambling.
Part II of this Article explains the complicated, interlocked set of federal gaming laws at issue. These laws are critical to federal enforcement of state gambling laws and to federal involvement in states' decisions about what forms of gambling they might want to regulate. The law addressed in the Memorandum, the Wire Act, was the most important weapon the DOJ used to prevent states from authorizing Internet gambling, but it is not the only federal barrier to state-authorized gambling.
Part III discusses the tension among these federal laws, which at times undermine and contradict one another. With no legislative solution in sight, the Memorandum offers a clean solution and interprets the law to eliminate most, though not all, of the problems.
Part IV explores the explosion of Internet gambling, which is soon to be legalized by the states. The debate about Internet gambling has now been pushed to cash-strapped state authorities, allowing them to make their own decisions. This major change in federal law will advance the current wave of legalized gambling, which already encompasses all but two states. Internet gambling has the potential to spread pervasively with state cooperation. State legislators and governors are desperate to find ways to raise revenue without raising taxes. Gambling is seen as a painless tax, so states are seriously and quickly expanding to online gambling. They can  [*657]  now do so with the DOJ's blessing for every form of gambling except sports betting.",summarize the following text: ,"With a legal memorandum the Obama Administration reversed an aggressive, decades-old DOJ"") position and opened the door for states to legalize almost every form of Internet gambling without interference from federal laws OLC announced the major federal anti-gambling statute, the Wire Act applies only to bets on sports events and races By issuing a clear interpretation of previously vague and inconsistent federal gambling laws, the Executive Branch turned oversight of Internet gambling operations over to states

"Remote gambling is fundamentally different from brick-and-mortar casino gambling because the website operator never has complete control. Using technology undetectable to website operators and their regulators, it is possible for gamblers to play games from physical locations that are not what they seem. We know, because we have done it. Recently, House Energy and Commerce Committee staff and others in the Capitol Hill office of U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper, R-Miss., witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online. The Harper demonstration showed the technology and techniques that terror and crime organizations could use to operate untraceable money laundering built on a highly liquid legalized online poker industry — just the environment that will result from the spread of poker online. One of us set up a website — undetectablelaundering.com — to help communicate the problem to a broader audience. No one should doubt the ability of criminals to exploit the inherent weakness in online gambling. A drug cartel could arrange for buyers' machines to be remotely linked and lose to the aliased cartel machines. Drug buyers would not even need to play from their own machines. Illegal drug money would appear to be legal online winnings. A single poker game takes just a few hours to transfer $5 million as was recently demonstrated — legally — by American player Brian Hastings with his Swedish competitor half a world away. An established al-Qaida poker network could extract from the United States enough untraceable money in six days to fund an operation like the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. The threat is real. Last month a Texas lawyer was found guilty of trying to launder $600 million in drug money for a Mexican cartel. Caesar's Entertainment is currently under investigation by the Justice Department and IRS, accused of money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act violations. In December 2012, the FBI's Tampa field office asked us to take down the website explaining the threat. We complied. This May, special agents at FBI headquarters in Washington responsible for enforcing the Wire Act and all other federal gambling laws were briefed on the vulnerability. In July, a Senate Commerce Committee hearing seemed to reinforce concerns. Rep. C.W. Bill Young wrote a letter of concern to FBI director Robert Mueller on Aug. 7. But since then action seems to have stalled. And the threat moves on. With the passing of Young, we have put the website back up and joined together in hopes of spurring action. Since it remains true that gambling regulations in Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey are no match for determined terrorists and criminals, we feel duty-bound as responsible citizens to ensure knowledge of the threat reaches as many policymakers as possible. We have proved it is possible to make money laundering undetectable. Gambling should be firmly restricted to stay offline.",summarize the following text: ,"Remote gambling is fundamentally different from brick-and-mortar casino gambling Using tech undetectable to operators and regulators, House Commerce Committee witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online.

"The federal structure of the US means that its states possess considerable autonomy over the licensing and taxation of gambling. They have conferred monopolistic market power on gambling operators. Nevada may appear to be the most competitive casino market, but it is also the location of nearly 60% of the commercial casinos in the US – i.e. the State of Nevada has exercised its right to provide legitimacy to casino operations. By banning the placing of bets across state boundaries with the Wire Act, the federal government has buttressed states’ rights and ability to exercise power in determining what types of gambling are legal and there is a path dependence to the development of new regulations that ﬂows from this. The UIGEA is therefore less a new development in response to the ‘threat’ posed by a new borderless medium, and more an extension of long-established sub-national regulatory arrangements. At least in the short-term, it maintains the status quo in relations between established gambling operators and the states that regulate and have come to depend on them for taxation revenues. ¶ The UK has taken a national approach to regulation from the start. The national regulator is responsible for licensing gambling operators, and for nationally taxing them. Without regulations banning the placing of bets across the country, the industry has been less restricted in taking bets remotely, and sees the online environment as a natural extension of its interest in expanding commercial opportunities. The industry, as much as the state, supports the regulatory incorporation of online gambling not as a new industry that attacks its interests, but as an enabler of its ability to compete in new markets by enhancing its legitimacy in them.¶ The differing intersection of state and industry interests informed by historical national regulatory contexts has affected the differing regulatory approaches taken. Globally, the result is that the US has passed the regulatory ‘baton’ for legitimising the online gambling industry to the UK, and perhaps other advanced industrialised states. This is because the UK overtly desires to inﬂuence other states’ regulations as much as tempt online gambling providers onshore. The UK desires to extend its national jurisdictional control over the industry wherever possible, rather than excise it from within its borders. In this, the role of the online gambling industry itself is crucial. The largest ﬁrms and associations in the industry, such as Partygaming (2006), applaud the UK’s regulatory framework, and eCOGRA’s CEO declares that ‘it is in the best interests of the industry, which provides employment and revenues worldwide, that it is recognised and regulated by national laws and we want to continue to offer our support for what the UK is doing in this area’ (eCOGRA). Such industry support may serve to enlarge the territorial reach of the UK’s regulatory framework.¶",summarize the following text: ,"By banning the placing of bets across state boundaries with the Wire Act, the federal government has buttressed states’ rights and ability to exercise power in determining what types of gambling are legal and there is a path dependence to the development of new regulations that ﬂows from this. it maintains the status quo in relations between established gambling operators and the states that regulate and have come to depend on them for taxation revenues.

"Debating whether to legalize pot is increasingly pointless. Unless there’s an unexpected shock to public opinion, it’s going to happen, and sooner rather than later.  The important debate now is how to legalize it. The results of legalization depend strongly on the details of the post-prohibition tax and regulatory regimes. In the current situation, continued prohibition might be the worst option. Full commercial legalization on the alcohol model might well be the second-worst. But that is the way we’re heading.
I’m preparing an essay about designing a post-prohibition regime. After the jump is a set of topic sentences and paragraphs for sections of that essay, not yet in a well-defined order.
Substantive comments are welcome. Rant and snark will be ruthlessly zapped.
We probably should legalize cannabis. Prohibition is now breaking down. $35B/yr. is a lot of money to give to criminals, and no one has a plausible plan to shrink the illicit market under prohibition. Even where “medical marijuana” has degenerated into system when anyone can buy a user license from a crooked doctor, the voters still like it. Arguably, prohibition was worth trying. But it’s time to go home.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages. Cannabis legalization will reduce criminal revenue, intrusive enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and disorder around illicit markets, and enhance personal liberty, consumer choice, and respect for the law, and probably reduce bloodshed in Mexico. It might foster safer and more beneficial practices of cannabis use.
Legalization will certainly increase drug abuse, including heavy use by minors. Every adult is a potential source of leakage to minors. And if we insist on making minors consume illicitly-produced pot, we reserve 20-25% of the market for criminals. Much better to tolerate leakage and have a grey-market supply to minors like the current system that provides them with alcohol.
The polarized nature of the debate means that both sides wind up spending lots of time denying the obvious.
Good design tries to get as much of the advantages, and as little of the disadvantages, as possible.
The policies most likely to help control increases in drug abuse are taxation and other efforts to keep prices high, rules about consumer information (labeling and marketing), and “nudge” strategies to enhance consumer mindfulness.
It matters a lot whether, under conditions of legality, cannabis turns out to be a substitute for alcohol or instead a complement. Right now, no one knows the answer, which might not be the same for all parts of the population or the same in the long run as in the short run.
Analysis can help, but there’s no substitute for experience. The trick is not to get locked in to a set of bad policies. We need a process designed to learn from mistakes.
Neither “cannabis” nor “legalization” names its object with enough specificity. Lots of different things are legalization. Lots of different things are cannabis.",summarize the following text: ,"Debating whether to legalize pot is  pointless The important debate now is how to legalize it.

The final outcome addresses a dog that hasn’t barked: the effect of the Great Recession on cross-border conflict and violence. During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple analysts asserted that the financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of force as a tool for staying in power.37 Whether through greater internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict. Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fuel impressions of surge in global public disorder.
The aggregate data suggests otherwise, however. The Institute for Economics and Peace has constructed a “Global Peace Index” annually since 2007. A key conclusion they draw from the 2012 report is that “The average level of peacefulness in 2012 is approximately the same as it was in 2007.”38 Interstate violence in particular has declined since the start of the financial crisis – as have military expenditures in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that the Great Recession has not triggered any increase in violent conflict; the secular decline in violence that started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.39 Rogers Brubaker concludes, “the crisis has not to date generated the surge in protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion that might have been expected.”40
None of these data suggest that the global economy is operating swimmingly. Growth remains unbalanced and fragile, and has clearly slowed in 2012. Transnational capital flows remain depressed compared to pre-crisis levels, primarily due to a drying up of cross-border interbank lending in Europe. Currency volatility remains an ongoing concern. Compared to the aftermath of other postwar recessions, growth in output, investment, and employment in the developed world have all lagged behind. But the Great Recession is not like other postwar recessions in either scope or kind; expecting a standard “V”-shaped recovery was unreasonable. One financial analyst characterized the post-2008 global economy as in a state of “contained depression.”41 The key word is “contained,” however. Given the severity, reach and depth of the 2008 financial crisis, the proper comparison is with Great Depression. And by that standard, the outcome variables look impressive. As Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff concluded in This Time is Different: “that its macroeconomic outcome has been only the most severe global recession since World War II – and not even worse – must be regarded as fortunate.”42",summarize the following text: ,"The final outcome addresses the effect of the Great Recession on cross-border conflict analysts asserted the financial crisis would lead states to increase use of force internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict.

"Why is TPA so important?
I think some additional context is necessary here.
The administration is currently in the midst of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that is currently being negotiated between the United States and twelve other countries, including some of the world’s largest economies, such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico.
The Asia-Pacific region represents more than forty percent of the world’s trade.  And, as a group, TPP countries represent the largest goods and services export market for the United States.
On the other side of the world, the U.S. is negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the twenty-eight countries of the European Union.
The United States and the EU generate over half of the world’s economic output.
Total goods trade alone between the U.S. and EU amounts to over one trillion dollars a year.
Investment flows represent another three-hundred billion dollars a year.
Together, these two trade agreements have the potential to greatly expand access for U.S. products into foreign markets around the world.  Most importantly, they would help to grow our economy and create jobs here at home.
These two separate trade negotiations represent what is the most ambitious trade agenda in our nation’s recent history.  While everyone knows that I’m a pretty outspoken critic of the Obama Administration, I believe they deserve credit on this front.
But, if these negotiations are going to succeed, Congress must approve TPA.  Because of the unique structure of our government, our country needs TPA.
Our trading partners will not put their best deal on the table unless they know the United States can deliver on what we promise.
TPA empowers our trade negotiators to conclude agreements and provides a path for passage in Congress.
That is why every president since FDR has sought Trade Promotion Authority.  No economically significant trade agreement has ever been negotiated by any administration and approved by Congress without it.
Put simply, if Congress does not renew TPA, the TPP negotiations and those with the European Union will almost certainly fail.  That is why it is so disconcerting to me to see how some of my colleagues across the aisle have responded to President Obama’s call for TPA renewal.
TPA is one of the few issues where both parties can and should be able work together to achieve a common goal.  I know that I, along with my Republican colleagues, stand ready and willing to work with the administration to approve TPA as soon as possible.
I believe the bipartisan bill Chairman Baucus and I recently introduced to renew TPA would receive strong bipartisan support in the Senate if it were allowed to come up for a vote.
Indeed, I am confident that the vast majority of my colleagues would join me in supporting the bill.
The problem is, Republicans are not in the majority in the Senate.  It is the Democrats that control the agenda.   And, unfortunately, the President’s call to renew TPA does not appear to be a priority for them.",summarize the following text: ,"Why is TPA so important?

“The term PAD (Physician-Assisted Death) is utilized in this document with the belief that it captures the essence of the process in a more accurately descriptive fashion than the more emotionally charged designation Physician-Assisted Suicide.”

“Whereas there is increasing use of neutral terms like ‘physician-assisted dying,’ ‘physician-assisted death,’ or ‘physician aid in dying’ to avoid the more emotionally charged ‘physician-assisted suicide’…therefore be it resolved that the Principles Regarding Physician-Assisted Suicide…be AMENDED to read: ‘Physician Aid in Dying.’”
The American Medical Women’s Association
“The terms ‘assisted suicide’ and/or ‘physician-assisted suicide’ have been used in the past, including in an AMWA position statement, to refer to the choice of a mentally competent, terminally ill patient to self-administer medication for the purpose of controlling time and manner of death, in cases where the patient finds the dying process intolerable. The term ‘suicide’ is increasingly recognized as inaccurate and inappropriate in this context, and we reject that term. We adopt the less emotionally charged, value neutral, and accurate terms 'Aid in Dying' or 'Physician-Assisted Dying.'”
Washington State Psychological Association
“WSPA recognizes that the term ‘suicide’ implies psychiatric illness or other emotional distress that impairs judgment and decision-making capacity, and thus may not be an accurate or appropriate term for a terminally ill, mentally competent individual choosing to control the time and manner of his or her death. Therefore WSPA supports value-neutral terminology such as aid in dying, patient-directed dying, physician aid in dying, physician-assisted dying, or a terminally ill individual’s choice to bring about a peaceful and dignified death.”

"One -- US Security Umbrella -- it contains rivalries from developing and promotes a stable Middle East because of the deterrence commitment.
Two -- Stability now -- regimes have remained uninterrupted for decades and civil wars have rapidly declined.
Fettweis ‘7 (Christopher Fettweis, Asst Prof Poli Sci – Tulane, Asst Prof National Security Affairs – US Naval War College, “On the Consequences of Failure in Iraq,” Survival, Vol. 49, Iss. 4, December, p. 83 – 98)
Without the US presence, a second argument goes, nothing would prevent Sunni-Shia violence from sweeping into every country where the religious divide exists. A Sunni bloc with centres in Riyadh and Cairo might face a Shia bloc headquartered in Tehran, both of which would face enormous pressure from their own people to fight proxy wars across the region. In addition to intra-Muslim civil war, cross-border warfare could not be ruled out. Jordan might be the first to send troops into Iraq to secure its own border; once the dam breaks, Iran, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia might follow suit. The Middle East has no shortage of rivalries, any of which might descend into direct conflict after a destabilising US withdrawal. In the worst case, Iran might emerge as the regional hegemon, able to bully and blackmail its neighbours with its new nuclear arsenal. Saudi Arabia and Egypt would soon demand suitable deterrents of their own, and a nuclear arms race would envelop the region. Once again, however, none of these outcomes is particularly likely.¶ Wider war¶ No matter what the outcome in Iraq, the region is not likely to devolve into chaos. Although it might seem counter-intuitive, by most traditional measures the Middle East is very stable. Continuous, uninterrupted governance is the norm, not the exception; most Middle East regimes have been in power for decades. Its monarchies, from Morocco to Jordan to every Gulf state, have generally been in power since these countries gained independence. In Egypt Hosni Mubarak has ruled for almost three decades, and Muammar Gadhafi in Libya for almost four. The region's autocrats have been more likely to die quiet, natural deaths than meet the hangman or post-coup firing squads. Saddam's rather unpredictable regime, which attacked its neighbours twice, was one of the few exceptions to this pattern of stability, and he met an end unusual for the modern Middle East. Its regimes have survived potentially destabilising shocks before, and they would be likely to do so again.¶ The region actually experiences very little cross-border warfare, and even less since the end of the Cold War. Saddam again provided an exception, as did the Israelis, with their adventures in Lebanon. Israel fought four wars with neighbouring states in the first 25 years of its existence, but none in the 34 years since. Vicious civil wars that once engulfed Lebanon and Algeria have gone quiet, and its ethnic conflicts do not make the region particularly unique.¶",summarize the following text: ,"Without the US presence, nothing would prevent violence A Sunni bloc would fight proxy wars In addition to intra-Muslim civil war, cross-border warfare could not be ruled out.

"In practice, however, American federalism has become an administrative, ""cooperative federalism"": state and local govern- ments administer and implement federal programs.4 Many state-administered programs are funded by the federal govern- ment, in whole or, more often, in part. Others take the form of conditional preemption, meaning that the states may choose to administer the federal program or else, cede the regulatory field to the federal government. Cooperative federalism covers an enormous array of regulatory fields, from the environment to education to welfare and, lately, crime control. In its hori-zontal dimension, cooperative federalism       federalism's competition with state policy cartels and uniform regulatory baselines.5
This article argues that cooperative federalism is a rotten idea, its political popularity notwithstanding. Cooperative fed- eralism undermines political transparency and accountability, thereby heightening civic disaffection and cynicism; diminishes policy competition among the states; and erodes self-govern- ment and liberty. The sooner we can think of viable means to curtail cooperative programs and to disentangle government functions, the better off we shall be.
We may not be able to think of such means, much less to put them to work, any time soon. Dual, competitive (or, in modern public choice parlance, ""market-preserving"") federal- isms is unstable, principally because it frustrates political and interest group demands. Under realistic conditions, dual federalism's legal-institutional structures will crumble and accommodate anti-competitive, cooperative entanglements. 7 The corollary proposition is that cooperative federalism, unlike its virtuous but frail competitive cousin, is stable.

"It was a disappointing evasion, but not a surprising one. After all, the rhetoric of competitiveness -- the view that, in the words of President Clinton, each nation is ""like a big corporation competing in the global marketplace"" -- has become pervasive among opinion leaders throughout the world. People who believe themselves to be sophisticated about the subject take it for granted that the economic problem facing any modern nation is essentially one of competing on world markets -- that the United States and Japan are competitors in the same sense that Coca-Cola competes with Pepsi -- and are unaware that anyone might seriously question that proposition. Every few months a new best-seller warns the American public of the dire consequences of losing the ""race"" for the 21st century. A whole industry of councils on competitiveness, ""geo-economists"" and managed trade theorists has sprung up in Washington. Many of these people, having diagnosed America's economic problems in much the same terms as Delors did Europe's, are now in the highest reaches of the Clinton administration formulating economic and trade policy for the United States. So Delors was using a language that was not only convenient but comfortable for him and a wide audience on both sides of the Atlantic.
Unfortunately, his diagnosis was deeply misleading as a guide to what ails Europe, and similar diagnoses in the United States are equally misleading. The idea that a country's economic fortunes are largely determined by its success on world markets is a hypothesis, not a necessary truth; and as a practical, empirical matter, that hypothesis is flatly wrong. That is, it is simply not the case that the world's leading nations are to any important degree in economic competition with each other, or that any of their major economic problems can be attributed to failures to compete on world markets. The growing obsession in most advanced nations with international competitiveness should be seen, not as a well-founded concern, but as a view held in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. And yet it is clearly a view that people very much want to hold -- a desire to believe that is reflected in a remarkable tendency of those who preach the doctrine of competitiveness to support their case with careless, flawed arithmetic.
This article makes three points. First, it argues that concerns about competitiveness are, as an empirical matter, almost completely unfounded. Second, it tries to explain why defining the economic problem as one of international competition is nonetheless so attractive to so many people. Finally, it argues that the obsession with competitiveness is not only wrong but dangerous, skewing domestic policies and threatening the international economic system. This last issue is, of course, the most consequential from the standpoint of public policy. Thinking in terms of competitiveness leads, directly and indirectly, to bad economic policies on a wide range of issues, domestic and foreign, whether it be in health care or trade.",summarize the following text: ,"the rhetoric of competitiveness has become pervasive People who believe themselves to be sophisticated about the subject take it for granted that the economic problem facing any modern nation is essentially one of competing on world markets and are unaware that anyone might seriously question that proposition.

"With Gov. Jerry Brown throwing his political weight behind a plan to get half of California's electricity from renewable energy, experts say the idea is an ambitious but attainable way to limit climate change.
California utilities are on track to meet the state's current clean energy mandate, which requires them to buy 33 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. In his inaugural address last week, Brown proposed raising that mandate to 50 percent by 2030, as one of several steps to reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
""This is exciting, it is bold and it is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of stopping potentially catastrophic changes to our climate system,"" the Democrat told state lawmakers.
A previous effort to raise the renewable energy mandate above 50 percent — championed by then-Assemblyman V. Manuel Pérez, a Coachella Democrat — died in the state Legislature a year ago. Pérez's bill faced stiff opposition from utilities and businesses groups, who argued that the plan would drive up energy costs.
Now, though, Brown has thrown his substantial influence behind the proposal, coming off a re-election in which he cruised to victory by 20 points.
""With his leadership and commitment, and extensive political capital to spend at this point, I think we're very confident that achieving that outcome is doable,"" said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council's California Climate Program.
The details of Brown's renewable energy plan are still up in the air, and his office declined to offer more specifics.
But an increase in the renewable energy mandate could kick-start solar, wind and geothermal development in the desert, all of which have slowed over the last few years.
""The people putting money into renewable energy need to have a clearer signal that there is going to be a market for renewable energy,"" said Nancy Rader, executive director of the California Wind Energy Association. ""It was great for him to propose that goal.""
Ambitious, but achievable
Energy and climate experts have long assumed that California would raise its renewable energy mandate, officially known as the Renewables Portfolio Standard.
State policymakers have set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and that will be all but impossible without deeper cuts from the electricity sector, which accounts for about one-fifth of all emissions.
From a technical standpoint, energy experts say California should have little difficulty getting 50 percent of its electricity from renewable energy. The state has some of the best solar, wind and geothermal resources in the world, and it also has the option of importing renewable energy from other Western states.
While Democrats' control of both houses in the state Legislature doesn't give Brown a slam dunk, political observers and renewable energy advocates say his decision to highlight the plan in the inaugural address shows he's willing to fight for it.",summarize the following text: ,"With Gov.

"So how does this discussion of nation-states, nationalism, and global migration relate to “sex trafficking” discourse? I would like to suggest that this discourse provides a timely avenue for nation-states, such as Canada, to reassert their power and privileged identity, both within the nation itself and within the international “world order.” Depictions of “third-world” women as sexually deviant and their “third-world” male abusers as morally corrupt further classify nonnationals as the “other.” Members of the privileged “white” nation are called upon, in such discourse, to take the moral high ground and act as “saviours.” Propagated “sex trafficking” discourse suggests that by supporting tougher immigration controls and increased law enforcement, national members are in fact able to do so. This subsequently helps to reaffirm the importance and power of the nation-state and maintain the status quo.
In considering the vested interests of Canada and the United States, specifically, it is important to consider the impact of September 11th. Times of “national” crisis provide distinct space for nationalist rhetoric by the state, and also for the nation-state’s voice to become more “valid” (Liebner and Weisberg, 2002). Since 9/11, nationalist sentiments declaring the need to protect “national” values, identity, and “way of life” have been prevalent. Of important concern has become “[t]he need to ‘root out’ invisible enemies by identifying who does, and does not, belong to the [national] community…” (Rygiel, 2006, p. 145). This amplified nationalism has not only occurred in the United States post-9/11, but also in Canada. Canadians have come to see identity as a source of security (Rygiel, 2006), and thus have sought to defend it. Therefore in both the United States and Canada, the war on terror has been fought through gendered and racialized notions of citizenship (Rygiel, 200), and as such anti-trafficking sentiments have been complimentary to anti-terrorist sentiments. This has helped to garner support for both the tightening of borders and the differential inclusion of “others” within borders. Since 9/11 the United States has put additional pressure on Canada to tighten its borders through “trafficking in women” discourse. In 2005, in Bill C-49: An Act to Amend the Criminal Code (Trafficking in Persons), the Parliament of Canada noted that:
Canada is recognized as a relatively strong force in terms of the laws and resources in place to combat trafficking. However, a recent US report on trafficking criticized Canada’s limited ability to catch perpetrators, emphasizing that the government must use its laws “vigorously to increase investigations, arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of traffickers, especially those who may be abusing visa waivers and entertainment visas”.
This criticism is arguably rooted in the fact that Canada and the United States share a large frontier.",summarize the following text: ,"“sex trafficking” discourse provides a timely avenue for nation-states to reassert their power and privileged identity, both within the nation itself and within the international “world order.” Depictions of “third-world” women as sexually deviant and their “third-world” male abusers further classify nonnationals as the “other.” Members of the privileged nation are called upon to take the moral high ground and act as “saviours.” This helps to reaffirm the importance and power of the nation-state and maintain the status quo

"Debating whether to legalize pot is increasingly pointless. Unless there’s an unexpected shock to public opinion, it’s going to happen, and sooner rather than later.  The important debate now is how to legalize it. The results of legalization depend strongly on the details of the post-prohibition tax and regulatory regimes. In the current situation, continued prohibition might be the worst option. Full commercial legalization on the alcohol model might well be the second-worst. But that is the way we’re heading.
I’m preparing an essay about designing a post-prohibition regime. After the jump is a set of topic sentences and paragraphs for sections of that essay, not yet in a well-defined order.
Substantive comments are welcome. Rant and snark will be ruthlessly zapped.
We probably should legalize cannabis. Prohibition is now breaking down. $35B/yr. is a lot of money to give to criminals, and no one has a plausible plan to shrink the illicit market under prohibition. Even where “medical marijuana” has degenerated into system when anyone can buy a user license from a crooked doctor, the voters still like it. Arguably, prohibition was worth trying. But it’s time to go home.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages. Cannabis legalization will reduce criminal revenue, intrusive enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and disorder around illicit markets, and enhance personal liberty, consumer choice, and respect for the law, and probably reduce bloodshed in Mexico. It might foster safer and more beneficial practices of cannabis use.
Legalization will certainly increase drug abuse, including heavy use by minors. Every adult is a potential source of leakage to minors. And if we insist on making minors consume illicitly-produced pot, we reserve 20-25% of the market for criminals. Much better to tolerate leakage and have a grey-market supply to minors like the current system that provides them with alcohol.
The polarized nature of the debate means that both sides wind up spending lots of time denying the obvious.
Good design tries to get as much of the advantages, and as little of the disadvantages, as possible.
The policies most likely to help control increases in drug abuse are taxation and other efforts to keep prices high, rules about consumer information (labeling and marketing), and “nudge” strategies to enhance consumer mindfulness.
It matters a lot whether, under conditions of legality, cannabis turns out to be a substitute for alcohol or instead a complement. Right now, no one knows the answer, which might not be the same for all parts of the population or the same in the long run as in the short run.
Analysis can help, but there’s no substitute for experience. The trick is not to get locked in to a set of bad policies. We need a process designed to learn from mistakes.

"To raise these issues effectively, the movement for nuclear disarmament must overcome its reluctance to speak in terms of power, of institutional racism, and imperialist military terror. The issues of nuclear disarmament and peace have been mystified because they have been placed within a doomsday frame which separates these issues from other ones, saying, ""How can we talk about struggles against racism, poverty, and exploitation when there will be no world after they drop the bombs?"" The struggle for peace cannot be separated from, nor considered more sacrosanct than, other struggles concerned with human life and change.
In April, 1979, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency released a report on the effects of nuclear war that concludes that, in a general nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, 25 to 100 million people would be killed. This is approximately the same number of African people who died between 1492 and 1890 as a result of the African slave trade to the New World. The same federal report also comments on the destruction of urban housing that would cause massive shortages after a nuclear war, as well as on the crops that would be lost, causing massive food shortages. Of course, for people of color the world over, starvation is already a common problem, when, for example, a nation's crops are grown for export rather than to feed its own people. And the housing of people of color throughout the world's urban areas is already blighted and inhumane: families live in shacks, shanty towns, or on the streets; even in the urban areas of North America, the poor may live without heat or running water.
For people of color, the world as we knew it ended centuries ago. Our world, with its own languages, customs and ways, ended. And we are only now beginning to see with increasing clarity that our task is to reclaim that world, struggle for it, and rebuld it in our own image. The ""death culture"" we live in has convinced many to be more concerned with death than with life, more willing to demonstrate for ""survival at any cost"" than to struggle for liberty and peace with dignity. Nuclear disarmament becomes a safe issue when it is not linked to the daily and historic issues of racism, to the ways in which people of color continue to be murdered. Acts of war, nuclear holocausts, and genocide have already been declared on our jobs, our housing, our schools, our families, and our lands.
As women of color, we are warriors, not pacifists. We must fight as a people on all fronts, or we will continue to die as a people. We have fought in people's wars in China, in Cuba, in Guinea-Bissau, and in such struggles as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and in countless daily encounters with landlords, welfare departments, and schools. These struggles are not abstractions, but the only means by which we have gained the ability to eat and to provide for the future of our people.",summarize the following text: ,"The issues of nuclear peace have been mystified because they have been placed within a doomsday frame which separates these issues from other ones, saying, ""How can we talk about racism and exploitation when there will be no world after they drop the bombs?""

"Debating whether to legalize pot is increasingly pointless. Unless there’s an unexpected shock to public opinion, it’s going to happen, and sooner rather than later.  The important debate now is how to legalize it. The results of legalization depend strongly on the details of the post-prohibition tax and regulatory regimes. In the current situation, continued prohibition might be the worst option. Full commercial legalization on the alcohol model might well be the second-worst. But that is the way we’re heading.
I’m preparing an essay about designing a post-prohibition regime. After the jump is a set of topic sentences and paragraphs for sections of that essay, not yet in a well-defined order.
Substantive comments are welcome. Rant and snark will be ruthlessly zapped.
We probably should legalize cannabis. Prohibition is now breaking down. $35B/yr. is a lot of money to give to criminals, and no one has a plausible plan to shrink the illicit market under prohibition. Even where “medical marijuana” has degenerated into system when anyone can buy a user license from a crooked doctor, the voters still like it. Arguably, prohibition was worth trying. But it’s time to go home.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages. Cannabis legalization will reduce criminal revenue, intrusive enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and disorder around illicit markets, and enhance personal liberty, consumer choice, and respect for the law, and probably reduce bloodshed in Mexico. It might foster safer and more beneficial practices of cannabis use.
Legalization will certainly increase drug abuse, including heavy use by minors. Every adult is a potential source of leakage to minors. And if we insist on making minors consume illicitly-produced pot, we reserve 20-25% of the market for criminals. Much better to tolerate leakage and have a grey-market supply to minors like the current system that provides them with alcohol.
The polarized nature of the debate means that both sides wind up spending lots of time denying the obvious.
Good design tries to get as much of the advantages, and as little of the disadvantages, as possible.
The policies most likely to help control increases in drug abuse are taxation and other efforts to keep prices high, rules about consumer information (labeling and marketing), and “nudge” strategies to enhance consumer mindfulness.
It matters a lot whether, under conditions of legality, cannabis turns out to be a substitute for alcohol or instead a complement. Right now, no one knows the answer, which might not be the same for all parts of the population or the same in the long run as in the short run.
Analysis can help, but there’s no substitute for experience. The trick is not to get locked in to a set of bad policies. We need a process designed to learn from mistakes.

"The argument that interdependence gives rise to peace is flawed in theory as well as in practice. Conflicts arise from friction, particularly friction involving the fundamental interests of different nations. The less interdependence there is, the fewer the areas of serious friction. The more interdependence there is, the greater the areas of friction, and, therefore, the greater the potential for conflict. Two widely separated nations that trade little with each other are unlikely to go to war—Brazil is unlikely to fight Madagascar precisely because they have so little to do with each other. France and Germany, on the other hand, which have engaged in extensive trade and transnational finance, have fought three wars with each other over about seventy years. Interdependence was the root of the conflicts, not the deterrent. There are, of course, cases of interdependence in which one country effectively absorbs the other or in which their interests match so precisely that the two countries simply merge. In other cases, interdependence remains peaceful because the economic, military, and political power of one country is overwhelming and inevitable. In relations between advanced industrialized countries and third-world countries, for example, this sort of asymmetrical relationship can frequently be seen. All such relationships have a quality of unease built into them, particularly when the level of interdependence is great. When one or both nations attempt, intentionally or unintentionally, to shift the balance of power, the result is often tremendous anxiety and, sometimes, real pain. Each side sees the other’s actions as an attempt to gain advantage and becomes frightened. In the end, precisely because the level of interdependence is so great, the relationship can, and frequently does, spiral out of control. Consider the seemingly miraculous ability of the United States and Soviet Union to be rivals and yet avoid open warfare. These two powers could forgo extreme measures because they were not interdependent. Neither relied on the other for its economic well-being, and therefore, its social stability. This provided considerable room for maneuvering. Because there were few economic linkages, neither nation felt irresistible pressure to bring the relationship under control; neither felt any time constraint. Had one country been dependent on the other for something as important as oil or long-term investment, there would have been enormous fear of being held hostage economically. Each would have sought to dominate the relationship, and the result would have been catastrophic. In the years before World War I, as a result of European interdependence, control of key national issues fell into the hands of foreign governments. Thus, decisions made in Paris had tremendous impact on Austria, and decisions made in London determined growth rates in the Ruhr. Each government sought to take charge of its own destiny by shifting the pattern of interdependence in its favor. Where economic means proved insufficient, political and military strategies were tried.",summarize the following text: ,"The argument that interdependence gives rise to peace is flawed Conflicts arise from friction The less interdependence there is, the fewer the areas of serious friction Two widely separated nations that trade little with each other are unlikely to go to war precisely because they have so little to do with each other.

"The federal structure of the US means that its states possess considerable autonomy over the licensing and taxation of gambling. They have conferred monopolistic market power on gambling operators. Nevada may appear to be the most competitive casino market, but it is also the location of nearly 60% of the commercial casinos in the US – i.e. the State of Nevada has exercised its right to provide legitimacy to casino operations. By banning the placing of bets across state boundaries with the Wire Act, the federal government has buttressed states’ rights and ability to exercise power in determining what types of gambling are legal and there is a path dependence to the development of new regulations that ﬂows from this. The UIGEA is therefore less a new development in response to the ‘threat’ posed by a new borderless medium, and more an extension of long-established sub-national regulatory arrangements. At least in the short-term, it maintains the status quo in relations between established gambling operators and the states that regulate and have come to depend on them for taxation revenues. ¶ The UK has taken a national approach to regulation from the start. The national regulator is responsible for licensing gambling operators, and for nationally taxing them. Without regulations banning the placing of bets across the country, the industry has been less restricted in taking bets remotely, and sees the online environment as a natural extension of its interest in expanding commercial opportunities. The industry, as much as the state, supports the regulatory incorporation of online gambling not as a new industry that attacks its interests, but as an enabler of its ability to compete in new markets by enhancing its legitimacy in them.¶ The differing intersection of state and industry interests informed by historical national regulatory contexts has affected the differing regulatory approaches taken. Globally, the result is that the US has passed the regulatory ‘baton’ for legitimising the online gambling industry to the UK, and perhaps other advanced industrialised states. This is because the UK overtly desires to inﬂuence other states’ regulations as much as tempt online gambling providers onshore. The UK desires to extend its national jurisdictional control over the industry wherever possible, rather than excise it from within its borders. In this, the role of the online gambling industry itself is crucial. The largest ﬁrms and associations in the industry, such as Partygaming (2006), applaud the UK’s regulatory framework, and eCOGRA’s CEO declares that ‘it is in the best interests of the industry, which provides employment and revenues worldwide, that it is recognised and regulated by national laws and we want to continue to offer our support for what the UK is doing in this area’ (eCOGRA). Such industry support may serve to enlarge the territorial reach of the UK’s regulatory framework.¶",summarize the following text: ,"By banning the placing of bets across state boundaries with the Wire Act, the federal government has buttressed states’ rights and ability to exercise power in determining what types of gambling are legal and there is a path dependence to the development of new regulations that ﬂows from this. it maintains the status quo in relations between established gambling operators and the states that regulate and have come to depend on them for taxation revenues.

"Thought of Canada being the region where the sparks for World War III will be struck may not seem likely, but there is one area where a foreign foe could surprise the West: Quebec. If Quebec were to secede from Canada, two unsettling possibilities could occur. The first is that Canada could go to war with its wayward province. The second is that some power like China or Russia could build an alliance with Quebec. While such possibilities are unlikely, there are means of defense.
The Canadian Civil War
If Quebec were to secede from Canada, there are several points that could spark a civil war between the two. The least likely would be national pride. There are several economic reasons that could provide the tinder for war. Quebec controls the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, and Quebec could use that control to wage economic war with Western Canada. In addition, Quebec possesses significant reserves of natural resources that currently contribute to the North American economy on a free basis. An independent Quebec would change that. Finally, Canada proper would become a split country, with a third of Canadian provinces being geographically separated from the Capital. In light of the fact that no state wants to be divided, and Canada already has several fluttering independence movements, the urge to prevent further dissolution will be strong.
While it is true that Canada does not have a large military, and Quebec has none, it is not impossible for war to break out. The Quebec separatists have used violence before, most notably with the murder of Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte, and it would be easy for a semi-independent Quebec to buy arms on the international market.
If Canada did get involved in civil war with Quebec, there are several options open to both sides if the war drags on. Canada could invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which could split NATO as France has traditionally expressed support for Francophone Quebec. It is unlikely Britain would be unconcerned with a core Commonwealth state being embroiled in civil war; especially depending on how the vote for Scottish independence goes this year. The United States would be committed, as they are deeply intertwined with Canada at every level.
States like Russia, China, or Iran could use the distraction of a civil war in the very center of the Anglosphere to press their boundaries with the Western Alliance. Furthermore, they could start supporting the Quebec rebels, either directly or through third party means. If the war was presaged by an internationally recognized referendum, then Russia or China could take the position that they are upholding international norms, and paint the Western states in a negative light. Attempts at arming the rebels or openly supporting them would directly threaten the fundamental security of the United States, as it would provide a foothold on the continent from which hostile states could threaten the United States.",summarize the following text: ,"Thought Canada sparks World War III there is one area where a foreign foe could surprise the West: Quebec.

"In the eleven years since the September 11 attacks, no terrorist has been able to detonate even a primitive bomb in the United States, and except for the four explosions in the London transportation system in 2005, neither has any in the United Kingdom. Indeed, the only method by which Islamist terrorists have managed to kill anyone in the United States since September 11 has been with gunfire—inflicting a total of perhaps sixteen deaths over the period (cases 4, 26, 32).11 This limited capacity is impressive because, at one time, small-scale terrorists in the United States were quite successful in setting off bombs. Noting that the scale of the September 11 attacks has “tended to obliterate America’s memory of pre-9/11 terrorism,” Brian Jenkins reminds us (and we clearly do need reminding) that the 1970s witnessed sixty to seventy terrorist incidents, mostly bombings, on U.S. soil every year.12 The situation seems scarcely different in Europe and other Western locales. Michael Kenney, who has interviewed dozens of government officials and intelligence agents and analyzed court documents, has found that, in sharp contrast with the boilerplate characterizations favored by the DHS and with the imperatives listed by Dalmia, Islamist militants in those locations are operationally unsophisticated, short on know-how, prone to making mistakes, poor at planning, and limited in their capacity to learn.13 Another study documents the difficulties of network coordination that continually threaten the terrorists’ operational unity, trust, cohesion, and ability to act collectively.14 In addition, although some of the plotters in the cases targeting the United States harbored visions of toppling large buildings, destroying airports, setting off dirty bombs, or bringing down the Brooklyn Bridge (cases 2, 8, 12, 19, 23, 30, 42), all were nothing more than wild fantasies, far beyond the plotters’ capacities however much they may have been encouraged in some instances by FBI operatives. Indeed, in many of the cases, target selection is effectively a random process, lacking guile and careful planning. Often, it seems, targets have been chosen almost capriciously and simply for their convenience. For example, a would-be bomber targeted a mall in Rockford, Illinois, because it was nearby (case 21). Terrorist plotters in Los Angeles in 2005 drew up a list of targets that were all within a 20-mile radius of their shared apartment, some of which did not even exist (case 15). In Norway, a neo-Nazi terrorist on his way to bomb a synagogue took a tram going the wrong way and dynamited a mosque instead.15 Although the efforts of would-be terrorists have often seemed pathetic, even comical or absurd, the comedy remains a dark one. Left to their own devices, at least a few of these often inept and almost always self-deluded individuals could eventually have committed some serious, if small-scale, damage.16",summarize the following text: ,"In the eleven years since September 11 no terrorist has been able to detonate even a primitive bomb in the U S the only method by which terrorists have managed to kill anyone in the U S has been with gunfire—inflicting a total sixteen deaths the 1970s witnessed sixty to seventy terrorist bombings, on U.S. soil Islamist militants are operationally unsophisticated, short on know-how, prone to making mistakes, poor at planning, and limited in their capacity to learn.13 difficulties of network coordination continually threaten the terrorists’ operational unity, trust, cohesion, and ability to act collectively the cases targeting large buildings, destroying airports, setting off dirty bombs were nothing more than wild fantasies, the efforts of terrorists have often seemed pathetic, even comical or absurd,"
