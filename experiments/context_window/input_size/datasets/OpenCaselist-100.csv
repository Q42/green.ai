The FBI recently wrote Congress for the second time expressing the Agency's concern that online gambling - including Internet poker - is vulnerable to money laundering and cheating and is a vehicle to bribe public officials and others. Online players can disguise both their location and identity and thereby fleece unsuspecting innocent participants. In its September, 2013 letter, the FBI stated ""Transnational organized crime (TOC) groups might exploit legal online gambling to generate revenue, steal personally identifiable information (PII), and engage in public corruption."" (http://bit.ly/1dOvbI9) The FBI's correspondence confirms what we have known for several years – that, despite the gambling industry's claims to the contrary, there exists effective and non-detectable methods which can be used to anonymize a player's identity and geo-location in order to corrupt a game and these threats will become more prevalent as more states race to embrace online gambling. As the FBI confirmed, ""Individuals may use a wide variety of mechanisms to conceal their physical location, or give the appearance of operating in a different jurisdiction …"" This statement is easily proven using scientifically verifiable and undetectable methods to demonstrate how a person located in Pakistan can play poker on a system located inside New Jersey. We know because we have done it. Despite what the poker websites and online gaming activists claim, this science is irrefutable and has been peer reviewed by top computer experts and law enforcement.¶ Online poker attracts big money. As recently demonstrated by American player Brian Hastings and his Swedish competitor half a world away, a single online poker game facilitated the international transfer of $5 million in mere hours. Accordingly, an established al-Qaida poker network could extract enough untraceable money from the United States in just a few days to fund several 9/11-sized attacks.¶ The website www.undetectablelaundering.com illustrates how this is accomplished, as does the statement of Jim Thackston ( http://bit.ly/1a1TDT5 ) which was included in the record of a recent US House Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade hearing regarding a bill seeking to legalize online poker nationwide.¶ We urge Congress to carefully consider all the consequences of legalized online gambling. No benefits outweigh these consequences. Online gambling's legalization solves none of the problems",cited by advocates and is sure to create many—including existential ones for America,and is sure to create many—including existential ones,cited by advocates and is sure to create many—including existential ones for America.,85.0,"<h4>Legalization fuels <u>organized crime</u> and <u>terrorism</u>, which causes <u>extinction</u> --regulations <u>can’t solve</h4><p></u>Joint statement by: Michael K. <u><strong>Fagan et al 14, career federal prosecutor and post-911 anti-terrorism coordinator active in investigating and prosecuting illegal offshore online commercial gambling enterprises; Earl L.

America's commitment to free trade will be tested in 2014. After years of indifference to trade policy, the Obama administration now has an agenda. Congress must decide whether the U.S. will lead in opening markets and creating fair rules for free enterprise in a new international economy. Where will Republicans stand?¶ The starting point will be Congress's consideration of Trade Promotion Authority, which enables the president to negotiate agreements subject to an up-or-down vote by Congress. Through TPA, Congress sets goals, procedures for working with the executive branch, and controls the details of the enabling legislation. The Obama administration has been slow to press for negotiating authority.¶ Fortunately, Sens. Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch, the Democratic chairman and ranking Republican on trade in the Senate, respectively, and Rep. Dave Camp, Republican chairman in the House, introduced their bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority bill last Thursday. Chairman Baucus would like to move the bill through the Senate Finance Committee this month before his confirmation as ambassador to China. Successful action would offer a substantive thank you to Congress's Democratic leader on trade.¶ The Obama administration hopes to close a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal this year. Of the 11 other countries in this trade pact, six already have U.S. free-trade agreements, which were negotiated and passed by Republicans. TPP would add important economies -- especially Japan and Vietnam -- while modernizing rules and better integrating all 12 economies. In addition to the growth benefits, TPP recommits America's strategic economic interests in the Asia-Pacific, complementing the U.S. security presence.¶ The U.S. is also combining geoeconomics with geopolitics by negotiating a Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) with the European Union. Together, TPP and TTIP could forge modern trade and investment rules with major economies of western and eastern Eurasia. To offer opportunities for global trade liberalization, the U.S. is also negotiating in the World Trade Organization freer trade for services businesses and a Digital Economy compact that would update the successful Information Technology Agreement of the 1990s. These openings would be especially valuable for middle-income economies that want to boost productivity and reach high incomes through more competitive service and information industries.¶ The economic record of America's free-trade agreements argues for expansion. America's free-trade partners account for about 45% of all U.S. exports, even though their economies amount to only 10% of global GDP. On average, in the first five years of a new free-trade agreement, U.S. exports grew three to four times as rapidly as U.S. exports to others. The U.S. has a trade surplus with its 20 free-trade partners -- in manufacturing, agriculture, and services -- instead of the large deficit it runs with the world.¶ These trade agreements serve principally to bring down the barriers of other countries, because U.S. restrictions are already relatively low. U.S. free-trade agreements are also comprehensive -- covering not only manufacturing and almost all agriculture, but also services, government procurement and transparency, investment and intellectual property, as well as dispute resolution. These trade agreements encourage others to move toward greater compatibility with the U.S. economy and legal framework.¶ Republicans have provided most of the votes in Congress for free-trade accords in the past. Here is why: The deals cut taxes on trade. They expand individual freedom, consumer choice and opportunities for innovation. They reduce governmental barriers. They boost the private sector. They enhance the rule of law and foster civil society.¶ An active trade agenda also signals America's interest in the rest of the world at a time others are worried about U.S. withdrawal. Free trade boosts development and economic reformers around the world, while supporting U.S. growth. For much of the world, America's commitment to stability seems more credible if built upon an economic foundation.","Economic diplomacy can be the basis for hard, soft and smart power.","Economic diplomacy can be the basis for hard, soft and smart power.","Economic diplomacy can be the basis for hard, soft and smart power.",67.0,"<h4>T’s heg- sustains leadership</h4><p><strong>Zoellick, 14<u><mark> --- served as president of the World Bank Group, U.S. trade representative and deputy secretary of state (1/13/2014, Robert, The Wall Street Journal, “Leading From the Front on Free Trade,” Factiva))</p><p></mark>America's commitment to free trade will be tested in 2014.
