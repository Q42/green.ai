The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word ""should""13 in the May 18 order connotes futurity or may be deemed a ruling in praesenti.14 The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of grammar;15 it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, ""and the same hereby is"", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge's intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16 Nisi prius orders should be so construed as to give effect to every words and every part of the text, with a view to carrying out the evident intent of the judge's direction.17 The order's language ought not to be considered abstractly. The actual meaning intended by the document's signatory should be derived from the context in which the phrase to be interpreted is used.18 When applied to the May 18 memorial, these told canons impel my conclusion that the judge doubtless intended his ruling as an in praesenti resolution of Dollarsaver's quest for judgment n.o.v. Approval of all counsel plainly appears on the face of the critical May 18 entry which is [885 P.2d 1358] signed by the judge.19 True minutes20 of a court neither call for nor bear the approval of the parties' counsel nor the judge's signature. To reject out of hand the view that in this context ""should"" is impliedly followed by the customary, ""and the same hereby is"", makes the court once again revert to medieval notions of ritualistic formalism now so thoroughly condemned in national jurisprudence and long abandoned by the statutory policy of this State. IV CONCLUSION Nisi prius judgments and orders should be construed in a manner which gives effect and meaning to the complete substance of the memorial. When a judge-signed direction is capable of two interpretations, one of which would make it a valid part of the record proper and the other would render it a meaningless exercise in futility, the adoption of the former interpretation is this court's due. A rule - that on direct appeal views as fatal to the order's efficacy the mere omission from the journal entry of a long and customarily implied phrase, i.e., ""and the same hereby is"" - is soon likely to drift into the body of principles which govern the facial validity of judgments. This development would make judicial acts acutely vulnerable to collateral attack for the most trivial of reasons and tend to undermine the stability of titles or other adjudicated rights. It is obvious the trial judge intended his May 18 memorial to be an in praesenti order overruling Dollarsaver's motion for judgment n.o.v. It is hence that memorial, and not the later June 2 entry, which triggered appeal time in this case. Because the petition. in error was not filed within 30 days of May 18, the appeal is untimely. I would hence sustain the appellee's motion to dismiss.21  Footnotes:  1 The pertinent terms of the memorial of May 18, 1993 are:  IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF BRYAN COUNTY, STATE OF OKLAHOMA COURT MINUTE 5/18/93 No. C-91-223  After having heard and considered arguments of counsel in support of and in opposition to the motions of the Defendant for judgment N.O.V. and a new trial, the Court finds that the motions should be overruled.

The clerk may ""enter"" only that which is ""on file."" The pertinent terms of 12 O.S. 1991 § 24 are: ""Upon the journal record required to be kept by the clerk of the district court in civil cases . . . shall be entered copies of the following instruments on file: 1.

A statement of the disposition of the action, proceeding, or motion, including a statement of the relief awarded to a party or parties and the liabilities and obligations imposed on the other party or parties; 3. The signature and title of the court; . . .""  7 The court holds that the May 18 memorial's recital that ""the Court finds that the motions should be overruled"" is a ""finding"" and not a ruling. In its pure form, a finding is generally not effective as an order or judgment. See, e.g., Tillman v. Tillman, 199 Okl. 130, 184 P.2d 784 (1947), cited in the court's opinion.  8 When ruling upon a motion for judgment n.o.v. the court must take into account all the evidence favorable to the party against whom the motion is directed and disregard all conflicting evidence favorable to the movant. If the court should conclude the motion is sustainable, it must hold, as a matter of law, that there is an entire absence of proof tending to show a right to recover. See Austin v. Wilkerson, Inc., Okl., 519 P.2d 899, 903 (1974).  9 See Bullard v. Grisham Const. Co., Okl., 660 P.2d 1045, 1047 (1983), where this court reviewed a trial judge's ""findings of fact"", perceived as a basis for his ruling on a motion for judgment n.o.v. (in the face of a defendant's reliance on plaintiff's contributory negligence). These judicial findings were held impermissible as an invasion of the providence of the jury and proscribed by OKLA. CONST. ART, 23, § 6 . Id. at 1048.  10 Everyday courthouse parlance does not always distinguish between a judge's ""finding"", which denotes nisi prius resolution of fact issues, and ""ruling"" or ""conclusion of law"". The latter resolves disputed issues of law. In practice usage members of the bench and bar often confuse what the judge ""finds"" with what that official ""concludes"", i.e., resolves as a legal matter.  11 See Fowler v. Thomsen, 68 Neb. 578, 94 N.W. 810, 811-12 (1903), where the court determined a ruling that ""[1] find from the bill of particulars that there is due the plaintiff the sum of . . ."" was a judgment and not a finding. In reaching its conclusion the court reasoned that ""[e]ffect must be given to the entire in the docket according to the manifest intention of the justice in making them."" Id., 94 N.W. at 811.  12 When the language of a judgment is susceptible of two interpretations, that which makes it correct and valid is preferred to one that would render it erroneous. Hale v. Independent Powder Co., 46 Okl. 135, 148 P. 715, 716 (1915); Sharp v. McColm, 79 Kan. 772, 101 P. 659, 662 (1909); Clay v. Hildebrand, 34 Kan. 694, 9 P. 466, 470 (1886); see also 1 A.C. FREEMAN LAW OF JUDGMENTS § 76 (5th ed. 1925).  13 ""Should"" not only is used as a ""present indicative"" synonymous with ought but also is the past tense of ""shall"" with various shades of meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments § 121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1984); St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075, 1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge quotation infra note 15.  Certain contexts mandate a construction of the term ""should"" as more than merely indicating preference or desirability. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury instructions stating that jurors ""should"" reduce the amount of damages in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was held to imply an obligation and to be more than advisory); Carrigan v.

See infra note 15. 3 Carter v. Carter, Okl., 783 P.2d 969, 970 (1989); Horizons, Inc. v. Keo Leasing Co., Okl., 681 P.2d 757, 759 (1984); Amarex, Inc. v.

The clerk may ""enter"" only that which is ""on file."" The pertinent terms of 12 O.S. 1991 § 24 are: ""Upon the journal record required to be kept by the clerk of the district court in civil cases . . . shall be entered copies of the following instruments on file: 1. All items of process by which the court acquired jurisdiction of the person of each defendant in the case; and 2. All instruments filed in the case that bear the signature of the and judge and specify clearly the relief granted or order made."" [Emphasis added.]  5 See 12 O.S. 1991 § 1116 which states in pertinent part:  ""Every direction of a court or judge made or entered in writing, and not included in a judgment is an order."" [Emphasis added.]  6 The pertinent terms of 12 O.S. 1993 § 696.3 , effective October 1, 1993, are:  ""A. Judgments, decrees and appealable orders that are filed with the clerk of the court shall contain: 1. A caption setting forth the name of the court, the names and designation of the parties, the file number of the case and the title of the instrument; 2. A statement of the disposition of the action, proceeding, or motion, including a statement of the relief awarded to a party or parties and the liabilities and obligations imposed on the other party or parties; 3. The signature and title of the court; . . .""  7 The court holds that the May 18 memorial's recital that ""the Court finds that the motions should be overruled"" is a ""finding"" and not a ruling. In its pure form, a finding is generally not effective as an order or judgment. See, e.g., Tillman v. Tillman, 199 Okl. 130, 184 P.2d 784 (1947), cited in the court's opinion.  8 When ruling upon a motion for judgment n.o.v. the court must take into account all the evidence favorable to the party against whom the motion is directed and disregard all conflicting evidence favorable to the movant. If the court should conclude the motion is sustainable, it must hold, as a matter of law, that there is an entire absence of proof tending to show a right to recover. See Austin v. Wilkerson, Inc., Okl., 519 P.2d 899, 903 (1974).  9 See Bullard v. Grisham Const. Co., Okl., 660 P.2d 1045, 1047 (1983), where this court reviewed a trial judge's ""findings of fact"", perceived as a basis for his ruling on a motion for judgment n.o.v. (in the face of a defendant's reliance on plaintiff's contributory negligence). These judicial findings were held impermissible as an invasion of the providence of the jury and proscribed by OKLA. CONST. ART, 23, § 6 . Id. at 1048.  10 Everyday courthouse parlance does not always distinguish between a judge's ""finding"", which denotes nisi prius resolution of fact issues, and ""ruling"" or ""conclusion of law"". The latter resolves disputed issues of law. In practice usage members of the bench and bar often confuse what the judge ""finds"" with what that official ""concludes"", i.e., resolves as a legal matter.  11 See Fowler v. Thomsen, 68 Neb. 578, 94 N.W. 810, 811-12 (1903), where the court determined a ruling that ""[1] find from the bill of particulars that there is due the plaintiff the sum of . . ."" was a judgment and not a finding. In reaching its conclusion the court reasoned that ""[e]ffect must be given to the entire in the docket according to the manifest intention of the justice in making them."" Id., 94 N.W. at 811.  12 When the language of a judgment is susceptible of two interpretations, that which makes it correct and valid is preferred to one that would render it erroneous. Hale v. Independent Powder Co., 46 Okl. 135, 148 P. 715, 716 (1915); Sharp v. McColm, 79 Kan. 772, 101 P. 659, 662 (1909); Clay v. Hildebrand, 34 Kan. 694, 9 P. 466, 470 (1886); see also 1 A.C. FREEMAN LAW OF JUDGMENTS § 76 (5th ed. 1925).  13 ""Should"" not only is used as a ""present indicative"" synonymous with ought but also is the past tense of ""shall"" with various shades of meaning not always easy to analyze. See 57 C.J. Shall § 9, Judgments § 121 (1932). O. JESPERSEN, GROWTH AND STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE (1984); St. Louis & S.F.R. Co. v. Brown, 45 Okl. 143, 144 P. 1075, 1080-81 (1914). For a more detailed explanation, see the Partridge quotation infra note 15.  Certain contexts mandate a construction of the term ""should"" as more than merely indicating preference or desirability. Brown, supra at 1080-81 (jury instructions stating that jurors ""should"" reduce the amount of damages in proportion to the amount of contributory negligence of the plaintiff was held to imply an obligation and to be more than advisory); Carrigan v. California Horse Racing Board, 60 Wash. App. 79, 802 P.2d 813 (1990) (one of the Rules of Appellate Procedure requiring that a party ""should devote a section of the brief to the request for the fee or expenses"" was interpreted to mean that a party is under an obligation to include the requested segment); State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211, 215 (Mo. 1958) (""should"" would mean the same as ""shall"" or ""must"" when used in an instruction to the jury which tells the triers they ""should disregard false testimony"").  14 In praesenti means literally ""at the present time.""

To determine if the omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, ""and the same hereby is"", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge's intent must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16 Nisi prius orders should be so construed as to give effect to every words and every part of the text, with a view to carrying out the evident intent of the judge's direction.17 The order's language ought not to be considered abstractly. <u><strong><mark>The actual meaning</mark> intended by the document's signatory <mark>should be derived from</mark> the <mark>context</mark> in which the phrase to be interpreted is used</u></strong>.18 When applied to the May 18 memorial, these told canons impel my conclusion that <u><strong><mark>the judge </mark>doubtless <mark>intended</mark> his <mark>ruling as</mark> an <mark>in praesenti resolution</mark> </u></strong>of Dollarsaver's quest for judgment n.o.v. Approval of all counsel plainly appears on the face of the critical May 18 entry which is [885 P.2d 1358] signed by the judge.19 True minutes20 of a court neither call for nor bear the approval of the parties' counsel nor the judge's signature. To reject out of hand the view that in this context ""should"" is impliedly followed by the customary, ""and the same hereby is"", makes the court once again revert to medieval notions of ritualistic formalism now so thoroughly condemned in national jurisprudence and long abandoned by the statutory policy of this State. IV CONCLUSION Nisi prius judgments and orders should be construed in a manner which gives effect and meaning to the complete substance of the memorial. When a judge-signed direction is capable of two interpretations, one of which would make it a valid part of the record proper and the other would render it a meaningless exercise in futility, the adoption of the former interpretation is this court's due. A rule - that on direct appeal views as fatal to the order's efficacy the mere omission from the journal entry of a long and customarily implied phrase, i.e., ""and the same hereby is"" - is soon likely to drift into the body of principles which govern the facial validity of judgments. This development would make judicial acts acutely vulnerable to collateral attack for the most trivial of reasons and tend to undermine the stability of titles or other adjudicated rights. It is obvious the trial judge intended his May 18 memorial to be an in praesenti order overruling Dollarsaver's motion for judgment n.o.v. It is hence that memorial, and not the later June 2 entry, which triggered appeal time in this case. Because the petition. in error was not filed within 30 days of May 18, the appeal is untimely. I would hence sustain the appellee's motion to dismiss.21  Footnotes:  1 The pertinent terms of the memorial of May 18, 1993 are:  IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF BRYAN COUNTY, STATE OF OKLAHOMA COURT MINUTE 5/18/93 No. C-91-223  After having heard and considered arguments of counsel in support of and in opposition to the motions of the Defendant for judgment N.O.V. and a new trial, the Court finds that the motions should be overruled.

But before ""we"" appear too complacently different from the privileged citizens who desire to caption the mute image of exotic suffering with an aversively fascinated mooning we must note that this feeling culture crosses over into other domains, the domains of what we call identity politics, where the wronged take up voice and agency to produce transformative testimony, which depends on an analogous conviction about the self-evidence and therefore the objectivity of painful feeling. I mean to challenge belief in the positive workings of national sentimentality, a rhetoric of promise that a nation can be built across fields of social difference through channels of affective identification and empathy. Sentimental politics promotes and maintains the hegemony of the national identity form, no mean feat in the face of continued widespread intercultural antagonism and economic cleavage. each citizen’s value is secured by an equation between abstractness and emancipation: a cell of national identity provides juridically protected personhood for citizens regardless of anything specific about them. In the second model, which was initially organized around labor, feminist, and antiracist struggles of the nineteenth-century United States, another version of the nation is imagined as the index of collective life. This nation is propled by suffering citizens and noncitizens whose structural exclusion from the utopian-American dreamscape exposes the state's claim of legitimacy and virtue to an acid wash of truth telling that makes hegemonic disavowal virtually impossible, at certain moments of political intensity. Sentimentality has long been the means by which mass subaltern pain is advanced, in the dominant public sphere, as the true core of national collectivity. It operates when the pain of intimate others burns into the conscience of classically privileged national subjects, such that they feel the pain of denied citizenship as their pain Theoretically Identification with pain, a universal true feeling, then leads to structural social change Yet, since these very sources of protection have buttressed traditional matrices of cultural hierarchy and since their historic job has been to protect universal subject from feeling and corporeal specificity as a political vulnerability, the imagined capacity of these institutions to assimilate to the affective tactics of subaltern counterpolitics suggests some weaknesses, or misrecognitions, in these tactics the sharp specificity of the traumatic model of pain mischaracterizes what a person is as what a person becomes in the experience of social negation this model also falsely premises a sharp picture of structural violence's source and scope, in tum promoting a dubious optimism that law and other visible sources of inequality can provide the best remedies for their own taxonomizing harms counterhegemonic deployments of pain as the measure of structural injustice actually sustain the utopian image of a homogeneous national metaculture, which can look like a healed or healthy body in contrast to the scarred and exhausted ones. the tactical use of trauma to describe the effects of social inequality so overidentifies the eradication of pain with the achievement of justice that it enables various confusions the equation of pleasure with freedom or the sense that changes in feeling, even on a mass scale, amount to substantial social change Sentimental politics makes these confusions credible and these violences bearable, as its cultural power confirms the centrality of inter-personal identification and empathy to the vitality and viability of collective life. This gives citizens something to do in response to overwhelming structural violence. Meanwhile, by equating mass society with that thing called ""national culture,"" these important transpersonal linkages and intimacies are too frequently serve as proleptic shields, as ethically uncontestable legitimating devices for sustaining the hegemonic field.","ravaged bodies saturate the global marketplace Yet even as the image of the traumatized proliferates it competes with a normative/utopian image of U.S. citizens who remains unmarked It takes place over a distance: even if the object is neither dead nor at any great distance mourning an act of social deathmaking . survival can only be achieved by a citizenry that uses its most creative energy to cultivate intimate spheres the pressure produces a cry for a double therapy— victim and viewer. sentimentality promotes and maintains the hegemony of the national identity form organized around labor and antiracist struggles the nation is imagined as the index of collective life. propled by suffering citizens and noncitizens whose structural exclusion from the utopian-American dreamscape exposes the state's claim of legitimacy Sentimentality has long been the means by which mass subaltern pain is advanced as the true core of national collectivity.

In the United States the media of the political public sphere regularly register new scandals of the proliferating sweatshop networks “at home” and “abroad,” which has to be a good thing, because it produces feeling and with it something at least akin to consciousness that can lead to action.3 Yet even as the image of the traumatized worker proliferates, even as evidence of exploitation is found under every rock or commodity, it competes with a normative/utopian image of the U.S. citizens who remains unmarked, framed, and protected by the private trajectory of his life project which is sanctified at the juncture where the unconscious meets history: the American Dream.4 in that story one’s identity is not borne of suffering, mental, physical, or economic. If the U.S. Worker’s lucky enough to live at an economic moment that sustains the Dream he gets to appear at his least national when he is working and at his most national at leisure, with his family or in semipublic worlds of other men producing surplus manliness (e.g., via sports). In the American dreamscape his identity is private property, a zone in which structural obstacles and cultural differences fade into an ether of prolonged, deferred, and individuating enjoyment that he has earned and that the nation has helped him to earn. Meanwhile, exploitation only appears as a scandalous nugget in the sieve of memory when it can be condensed into an exotic thing of momentary fascination, a squalor of the bottom too horrible to be read in its own actual banality. The exposed traumas of workers in ongoing extreme conditions do not generally induce more than mourning on the part of the state and the public culture to whose feeling based opinions the state is said to respond. Mourning is what happens when a grounding object is lost, is dead, no longer living (to you). Mourning is an experience of irreducible boundedness: I am here, I am living, he is dead, I am mourning. It is a beautiful, not sublime, experience of emancipation: mourning supplies the subject the definitional perfection of a being no longer in flux. It takes place over a distance: even if the object who induces the feeling of loss and helplessness is neither dead nor at any great distance from where you are? In other words, mourning can also be an act of aggression, of social deathmaking: it can perform the evacuation of significance from actually-existing subjects. Even when liberals do it, one might say, are ghosted for a good cause.6 The sorrow songs of scandal that sing of the exploitation that is always ""elsewhere"" (even a few blocks away) are in this sense aggressively songs of mourning. Play them backward, and the military march of capitalist triumphalism (The Trans-Nationale) can be heard. Its Lyric, currently creamed by every organ of record in the United States, is about necessity. It exhorts citizens to understand that the ""bottom line"" of national life is neither utopia nor freedom but survival, which can only be achieved by a citizenry that eats its anger, makes no unreasonable claims on resources or controls over value, and uses its most creative energy to cultivate intimate spheres while scrapping a Life together flexibly in response to the market world’s caprice8. In this particular moment of expanding class unconsciousness that looks like consciousness emerges a peculiar, though not unprecedented, here: the exploited child. If a worker can be infantilized, pictured as young, as small, as feminine or feminized, as starving, as bleeding and diseased, and as a (virtual) sieve, the righteous indignation around procuring his survival resounds everywhere. The child must not be sacrificed to states or to profiteering. His wounded image speaks a truth that subordinates narrative: he has not “freely” chosen his exploitation; the optimism and play that are putatively the right of childhood have been stolen from him. Yet only ""voluntary"" steps are ever taken to try to control this visible sign of what is ordinary and systemic amid the chaos of capitalism, in order in make its localized nightmares seem uninevitable. Privatize the atrocity, delete the visible sign, make it seem foreign. Return the child to the family, replace the children with admits who can look dignified while being paid virtually the same revoking wage. The problem that organizes so much feeling then regains livable proportions, and the uncomfortable pressure of feeling dissipates, like so much gas. Meanwhile, the pressure of feeling the shock of being uncomfortably political produces a cry for a double therapy—to the victim and the viewer. But before ""we"" appear too complacently different from the privileged citizens who desire to caption the mute image of exotic suffering with an aversively fascinated mooning (a desire for the image to be dead, a ghost), we must note that this feeling culture crosses over into other domains, the domains of what we call identity politics, where the wronged take up voice and agency to produce transformative testimony, which depends on an analogous conviction about the self-evidence and therefore the objectivity of painful feeling. The central concern of this essay is to address the place of painful feeling in the making of political worlds. In particular, I mean to challenge a powerful popular belief in the positive workings of something I call national sentimentality, a rhetoric of promise that a nation can be built across fields of social difference through channels of affective identification and empathy. Sentimental politics generally promotes and maintains the hegemony of the national identity form, no mean feat in the face of continued widespread intercultural antagonism and economic cleavage. But national sentimentality is more than a current of feeling that circulates in a political field: the phrase describes a longstanding contest between two models of US. citizenship. In one, the classic made}, each citizen’s value is secured by an equation between abstractness and emancipation: a cell of national identity provides juridically protected personhood for citizens regardless of anything specific about them. In the second model, which was initially organized around labor, feminist, and antiracist struggles of the nineteenth-century United States, another version of the nation is imagined as the index of collective life. This nation is propled by suffering citizens and noncitizens whose structural exclusion from the utopian-American dreamscape exposes the state's claim of legitimacy and virtue to an acid wash of truth telling that makes hegemonic disavowal virtually impossible, at certain moments of political intensity. Sentimentality has long been the means by which mass subaltern pain is advanced, in the dominant public sphere, as the true core of national collectivity. It operates when the pain of intimate others burns into the conscience of classically privileged national subjects, such that they feel the pain of flawed or denied citizenship as their pain. Theoretically, to eradicate the pain those with power will do whatever is necessary to return the nation once more to its legitimately utopian order. Identification with pain, a universal true feeling, then leads to structural social change. In return, subalterns scarred by the pain of failed democracy will reauthorize universalist notions of citizenship in the national utopia, which involves in a redemptive notion of law as the guardian of public good. The object of the nation and the law in this light is to eradicate systemic social pain, the absence of which becomes the definition of freedom. Yet, since these very sources of protection—the state, the law, patriotic ideology—have traditionally buttressed traditional matrices of cultural hierarchy, and since their historic job has been to protect universal subject I citizens from feeling their culture} and corporeal specificity as a political vulnerability, the imagined capacity of these institutions to assimilate to the affective tactics of subaltern counterpolitics suggests some weaknesses, or misrecognitions, in these tactics. For one thing, it may be that the sharp specificity of the traumatic model of pain implicitly mischaracterizes what a person is as what a person becomes in the experience of social negation; this model also falsely premises a sharp picture of structural violence's source and scope, in tum promoting a dubious optimism that law and other visible sources of inequality, for example, can provide the best remedies for their own taxonomizing harms. It is also possible that counterhegemonic deployments of pain as the measure of structural injustice actually sustain the utopian image of a homogeneous national metaculture, which can look like a healed or healthy body in contrast to the scarred and exhausted ones. Finally, it might be that the tactical use of trauma to describe the effects of social inequality so overidentifies the eradication of pain with the achievement of justice that it enables various confusions: for instance, the equation of pleasure with freedom or the sense that changes in feeling, even on a mass scale, amount to substantial social change. Sentimental politics makes these confusions credible and these violences bearable, as its cultural power confirms the centrality of inter-personal identification and empathy to the vitality and viability of collective life. This gives citizens something to do in response to overwhelming structural violence. Meanwhile, by equating mass society with that thing called ""national culture,"" these important transpersonal linkages and intimacies are too frequently serve as proleptic shields, as ethically uncontestable legitimating devices for sustaining the hegemonic field.9",10022.0,"<h4>Their empathetic witnessing is liberalism par excellence<strong> where debate is converted into a factory where subjectivity is produced and shipped out to the dispossessed other in sardine cans </h4><p><u>Berlant 1999 </u></strong>(Lauren, George M.

If the U.S. Worker’s lucky enough to live at an economic moment that sustains the Dream he gets to appear at his least national when he is working and at his most national at leisure, with his family or in semipublic worlds of other men producing surplus manliness (e.g., via sports). In the American dreamscape his identity is private property, a zone in which structural obstacles and cultural differences fade into an ether of prolonged, deferred, and individuating enjoyment that he has earned and that the nation has helped him to earn. Meanwhile, <u>exploitation only appears as a scandalous nugget in the sieve of memory when it can be condensed into an exotic thing of momentary fascination, a squalor of the bottom too horrible to be read in its own actual banality.</u> <u>The exposed traumas</u> of workers in ongoing extreme conditions <u>do not</u> generally <u>induce more than mourning on the part of the state and the public culture to whose feeling based opinions the state is said to respond</u>. <u>Mourning is what happens when a grounding object is lost, is dead, no longer living (to you).</u> <u>Mourning is an experience of irreducible boundedness: I am here, I am living, he is dead</u>, I am mourning. <u>It is a beautiful</u>, not sublime, <u>experience of emancipation: mourning supplies the subject the definitional perfection of a being no longer in flux. <mark>It takes place over a distance: even if the object</mark> who induces the feeling of loss and helplessness <mark>is neither dead nor at any great distance</u></mark> from where you are?

In this particular moment of expanding class unconsciousness that looks like consciousness emerges a peculiar, though not unprecedented, here: the exploited child. If a worker can be infantilized, pictured as young, as small, as feminine or feminized, as starving, as bleeding and diseased, and as a (virtual) sieve, the righteous indignation around procuring his survival resounds everywhere. The child must not be sacrificed to states or to profiteering. His wounded image speaks a truth that subordinates narrative: he has not “freely” chosen his exploitation; the optimism and play that are putatively the right of childhood have been stolen from him. Yet only ""voluntary"" steps are ever taken to try to control this visible sign of what is ordinary and systemic amid the chaos of capitalism, in order in make its localized nightmares seem uninevitable.

In what sense can study be a strategy? Study has a long tradition in Judaism as a form of resistance. In 586 BC, Jerusalem was plundered by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar and the temple of the Jews destroyed. Many Jews died and the rest were taken captive and brought to Babylonia. During the Babylonian exile, when they no longer had a temple and were forbidden to practise their faith, the Jewish people focused on the study of their holy books. After the Persian king Cyrus defeated Babylonia and issued a decree in 537 BC that the exiled Jews could return to their homelands and rebuild their holy sanctuaries, 40,000 Jews returned to rebuild the temple. But the religion of the Jews was already marked by exile and in 70 AD the temple was again destroyed, this time by the Romans. The temple was not rebuilt and study has since then become the true temple of the Jews. The Jewish religion is no longer focused on worship but on study. This gave the scholar a messianic significance (IP, 63). Talmud means ‘study’; the original meaning of Torah is not ‘law’ but ‘instruction’ Mishnan, the set of rabbinic laws, is derived from a root that has ‘repetition’ as its basic meaning. The study Agamben is aiming at does not have a predetermined goal: getting a degree and a good position in society, or getting some valuable insight that can be used to overthrow a political structure. Just as the strategy to close the door of the law was especially hard because the law does not prescribe anything and the task of the Messiah is paradoxical because there is no original structure of the law to restore, so study also lacks a transcendent meaning it can aim at, a goal it can set. As far as etymology is concerned, the word studium is closely related to a root that indicates a coffision, a shock or influence. Study and surprise are closely related in that sense. Whoever studies finds oneself shocked, amazed and is, in a certain sense, stupid (cf. studium, stupefying). On the one hand, study is undergone and, on the other, undertaken. Here Agamben sees a close affinity with Aristotle’s description of potentiality, which is passive on the one hand — an undergoing — and active on the other — an unstoppable drive to undertake something, to do something, to engage in action. Study is the place where undergoing and undertaking converge; it is a gesture (IP, 64). The rhythm of studying is an alternation between amazement and clarity, discovery and loss, doing and undergoing. This combination of undergoing and undertaking yields a kind of passive activity, a radical passivity. Something happens without seeming to happen. Agamben argues that study is pre-eminently unending. Study does not have an appropriate end nor does it desire it. This gives the scholar a woeful air. At first glance, the students in Kafka’s works seem to be of little use or significance. Nevertheless, Benjamin contends that they have a major role to play: ‘Among Kafka’s creations, there is a clan which reckons with the brevity of life in a peculiar way. The students who appear in the strangest places in Kafka’s works are the spokesmen for and leaders of this clan3° Agamben is in complete agreement with this view: [T]he latest, most exemplary embodiment of study in our culture is not the great philosopher nor the sainted doctor. It is rather the student, such as he appears in certain novels of Kafka or Walser. (IP, 65) It is precisely the apparent uselessness of the students and the hopelessness of study that plays such an important role in the strategy they develop with respect to power. Kafka’s useless students without Schrift So the students operating in Kafkas stories have an important characteristic: their studies seem to be useless. In Amerika, Karl sees a strange young man: He watched silently as the man read in his book, turned the pages and occasionally checked something in another book that he always picked up at lightning speed, often making entries in a notebook, his face always bent surprisingly low over it. Could this man be a student? He did seem to be studying. ... ‘You’re studying?’ asked Karl. ‘Yes, yes’, said the man, using the few moments lost to his studies to rearrange his books.3’ (...) And when wifi you be finished with your studies?’ asked Karl. ‘It’s slow going’, said the student. ... ‘[Y]ou can be happy about having given up your studies. I myself have been studying for years, out of pure single-mindedness. It has given me little satisfaction and even less chance of a decent future. 32 Karl explains his problems with Delamarche to the student. The student cannot really help him either; he does not offer Karl any insight in what he must do and even advises him to remain with Delamarche ‘absolutely33 Karl wonders where studying had got him [or her] — he [or she] had forgotten everything again.34 The most extreme example of a student, in Agamben’s view, is MelvillËs Bartleby, the scriber who stopped writing. According to Benjamin, Kafkas students have also lost the Schrift. This can mean either that they have stopped writing or that they have lost the Schrift in the sense of the Torah, the object of study. According to Scholem, the students have not lost the Schrift or the Torah, but they can no longer decipher it (cited in HS, 51). Nonetheless, Benjamin’s genius is apparent, according to Agamben, precisely in the fact that the students have lost the Schrift. Their commentaries on the Schrift, on the Law, are notes in the margin of a blank page.35 Study does not lead to an a priori determined goal; Kafka does not attach any promises to study that are traditionally attached to the study of the Torah. According to Agamben, the messianic tension of study is turned around here. Or better: it has gone beyond itself. Its gesture is that of a power that does not precede but follows its action, which it has left behind forever, of a Talmud that has not only announced the reconstruction of the temple but has already forgotten it. ‘At this point, study shakes off the sadness that disfigured it and returns to its truest nature: not work, but inspiration, the self-nourishment of the soul’ (IP, 65).36 Kafkas assistants are members of a congregation who have lost their house of prayer. His students have forgotten how to write, have lost the Schrift. Now nothing stops them on their ‘[u]ntrammeled, happy journey:37 The study of the horse Bucephalus But the most enigmatic example of the student in Kafkas work may be Alexander the Great’s horse Bucephalus, who happens to become a lawyer to the surprise of his colleagues. We have a new lawyer, Dr. Bucephalus. In his outward appearance there is little to recall the time when he was the warhorse of Alexander of Macedonia. ... I recently saw a quite simple court usher with the knowing eye of a little racetrack regular marveffing at the lawyer as the latter, lifting his thighs high, mounted step by step with a stride that made the marble clang. In general the bar approves the admission of Bucephalus. ... Nowadays, as no one can deny, there is no great Alexander. To be sure, many know how to commit murder ... and many feel that Macedonia is too narrow ... but no one, no one, can lead the way to India. Even in those days India’s gates were beyond reach, but their direction was indicated by the royal sword. ... Today ... no one shows the way; many carry swords but only wave them in the air and the gaze that tries to follow them grows confused. Perhaps, therefore, it is really best, as Bucephalus has done, to immerse oneself in law books. Free, his flanks unburdened by the loins of the rider, by quiet lamplight, far from the tumult of Alexander’s baffle, he reads and turns the pages of our old books.38 In his interpretation of this story, Werner Kraft concludes that law is set over against myth in the name of justice: instead of taking part in the mythical (pre-law) struggle, Bucephalus devotes himself to law.39 Benjamin sees this as a serious misunderstanding of Kafkas story. Indeed, the goal is to unmask mythical-juridical violence and human beings, like the horse Bucephalus, must tame the mythical forces at whatever cost (SE, 63). But, according to Benjamin, what is new about this ‘new lawyer what is new for the legal profession, is that he does not practice law but only studies it, reading in tranquil lamplight. Bucephalus is free: his flanks are no longer squeezed by Alexander the Great’s thighs and he is no longer carrying the latter on his back. The door to justice is not to employ law but to make it inoperative — not by practicing law (which would be a repetition of the mythical forces, given that law is in force without significance), but by doing nothing more than studying it. ‘The law which is studied but no longer practiced is the gate to justice. Bucephalus’ strategy against law is thus study. Agamben remarks that it is decisive that the law that is not practiced but only studied does not itself become justice but only the door to it. The study of the law has no ‘higher purpose’ – that is why the law has become inoperative.4’ ‘That which opens the passage to justice is not the abolishment of the law but its deactivation and inactivity — that is, another use of the law’ (SE, 63). This is a law that is liberated from all discipline and all relation to sovereignty. Bucephalus depicts a figure of the law that is possible after its link with violence and power has been deposed, a law that is no longer in force and applied (SE, 63-64), just as the study of doorkeepers by the man from the country makes it possible to remain living outside the law. Agamben then outlines the following picture of the future: One day humanity will play with law just as children play with disused objects, not in order to restore them to their canonical use, but to free them from it for good.

Nevertheless, Benjamin contends that they have a major role to play: ‘Among Kafka’s creations, there is a clan which reckons with the brevity of life in a peculiar way. The students who appear in the strangest places in Kafka’s works are the spokesmen for and leaders of this clan3° Agamben is in complete agreement with this view: [T]he latest, most exemplary embodiment of study in our culture is not the great philosopher nor the sainted doctor. It is rather the student, such as he appears in certain novels of Kafka or Walser. (IP, 65) It is precisely the apparent uselessness of the students and the hopelessness of study that plays such an important role in the strategy they develop with respect to power. Kafka’s useless students without Schrift So the students operating in Kafkas stories have an important characteristic: their studies seem to be useless. In Amerika, Karl sees a strange young man: He watched silently as the man read in his book, turned the pages and occasionally checked something in another book that he always picked up at lightning speed, often making entries in a notebook, his face always bent surprisingly low over it. Could this man be a student? He did seem to be studying. ... ‘You’re studying?’ asked Karl. ‘Yes, yes’, said the man, using the few moments lost to his studies to rearrange his books.3’ (...) And when wifi you be finished with your studies?’ asked Karl. ‘It’s slow going’, said the student. ... ‘[Y]ou can be happy about having given up your studies. I myself have been studying for years, out of pure single-mindedness. It has given me little satisfaction and even less chance of a decent future. 32 Karl explains his problems with Delamarche to the student. <u>The student cannot really help him either; he does not offer Karl any insight in what he must do and even advises him to remain with Delamarche ‘absolutely33 Karl wonders where studying had got him [or her] — he [or she] had forgotten everything again</u>.<u>34 The most extreme example of a student</u>, in Agamben’s view, is MelvillËs Bartleby, <u>the scriber who stopped writing</u>. According to Benjamin, Kafkas students have also lost the Schrift. This can mean either that <u>they have stopped writing or that they have lost</u> the Schrift in the sense of the Torah, <u>the object of study</u>. According to Scholem, <u>the students</u> have not lost the Schrift or the Torah, but they <u>can no longer decipher it</u> (cited in HS, 51). Nonetheless, Benjamin’s genius is apparent, according to Agamben, precisely in the fact that the students have lost the Schrift. <u>Their commentaries on the Schrift, on the Law, are notes in the margin of a blank page.35 Study does not lead to an a priori determined goal</u>; Kafka does not attach any promises to study that are traditionally attached to the study of the Torah. According to Agamben, the messianic tension of <u>study</u> is turned around here. Or better: it <u>has gone beyond itself. Its gesture is that of a <mark>power</mark> that does not precede but <mark>follows its action, which it </mark>has <mark>left behind forever</u></mark>, of a Talmud that has not only announced the reconstruction of the temple but has already forgotten it. <u>‘At this point, study shakes off the sadness that disfigured it and returns to its truest nature: not work, but inspiration, the self-nourishment of the soul’</u> (IP, 65).36 Kafkas assistants are members of a congregation who have lost their house of prayer. His students have forgotten how to write, have lost the Schrift. Now nothing stops them on their ‘[u]ntrammeled, happy journey:37 The study of the horse Bucephalus But the most enigmatic example of the student in Kafkas work may be Alexander the Great’s horse Bucephalus, who happens to become a lawyer to the surprise of his colleagues. We have a new lawyer, Dr. Bucephalus. In his outward appearance there is little to recall the time when he was the warhorse of Alexander of Macedonia. ... I recently saw a quite simple court usher with the knowing eye of a little racetrack regular marveffing at the lawyer as the latter, lifting his thighs high, mounted step by step with a stride that made the marble clang. In general the bar approves the admission of Bucephalus. ... Nowadays, as no one can deny, there is no great Alexander. To be sure, many know how to commit murder ... and many feel that Macedonia is too narrow ... but no one, no one, can lead the way to India. Even in those days India’s gates were beyond reach, but their direction was indicated by the royal sword. ... Today ... no one shows the way; many carry swords but only wave them in the air and the gaze that tries to follow them grows confused. Perhaps, therefore, it is really best, as Bucephalus has done, to immerse oneself in law books. Free, his flanks unburdened by the loins of the rider, by quiet lamplight, far from the tumult of Alexander’s baffle, he reads and turns the pages of our old books.38 In his interpretation of this story, Werner Kraft concludes <u>that law is set over against myth in the name of justice: instead of taking part in the mythical (pre-law) struggle</u>, Bucephalus devotes himself to law.39 Benjamin sees this as a serious misunderstanding of Kafkas story. Indeed, <u><mark>the goal is to <strong>unmask mythical-juridical violence</mark> and human beings</u></strong>, like the horse Bucephalus, <u>must tame the mythical forces at whatever cost</u> (SE, 63). But, according to Benjamin, <u>what is new about <mark>this ‘new lawyer</mark> what is new for the legal profession, is that he <strong><mark>does not practice law but only studies it</strong></mark>, reading in tranquil lamplight.</u> Bucephalus is free: his flanks are no longer squeezed by Alexander the Great’s thighs and he is no longer carrying the latter on his back. <u><strong><mark>The door to justice is not to employ law but to make it inoperative</strong></mark> — <strong>not by <mark>practicing law</strong></mark> (which <strong><mark>would be</mark> a <mark>repetition</strong></mark> of the mythical forces, <mark>given <strong>that law is</mark> in <mark>force without significance</strong></mark>), but by doing nothing more than studying it. ‘<strong>The law which is studied but no longer practiced is the gate to justice</strong>. Bucephalus’ strategy against law is thus study. Agamben remarks that it is decisive that the law that is not practiced but only studied does not itself become justice but only the door to it. <strong>The <mark>study </mark>of the law <mark>has no ‘higher purpose’ – that is why</mark> the <mark>law has become inoperative</mark>.</strong>4’ ‘That which opens the passage to justice is not the abolishment of the law but its deactivation and inactivity — that is, another use of the law’</u> (SE, 63). <u>This is a law that is liberated from all discipline and all relation to sovereignty</u>. Bucephalus depicts <u>a figure of the <mark>law</mark> that <mark>is possible <strong>after its link with violence and power has been deposed</strong>, a law that is <strong>no longer in force and applied</u></strong></mark> (SE, 63-64), <u>just as the study of doorkeepers by the man from the country makes it possible to remain living outside the law. Agamben then outlines the following picture of the future: One day <strong><mark>humanity will play with law</mark> just <mark>as children play with disused</mark> <mark>objects</strong></mark>, <strong><mark>not</mark> in order <mark>to restore them</strong></mark> to their canonical use, <strong><mark>but to free them from it</u></strong></mark> <u>for good.</u> (SE, 64)</p>",1NC,,Off,124635,14,16988,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/EvZo/Baylor-Evans-Zoda-Neg-NDT-Round4.docx,564730,N,NDT,4,Emory BD,"Sean Kennedy, Joe Bellon, Travis Cram","1ac was prostitution workers rights

Strong empirical support for diversion would identify a more complete set of causal mechanisms underlying international conflict. The cases investigated in this article, however, raise doubts about the strength of the diversionary hypothesis as well as the empirical validity of arguments based on diversionary mechanisms, such as Mansfield and Snyder’s theory about democratization and war.126 In Argentina and Turkey, the hypothesis fails to pass two most likely tests. In neither case was domestic unrest a necessary condition for the use of force as proponents of diversionary theory must demonstrate. Instead, external security challenges and bargaining over disputed territory better explain Argentine and Turkish decision making. The historical record, including leadership statements and reasoning, offers stronger evidence for a standard realist model and the dynamics of coercive diplomacy. Drawing definitive conclusions about diversion from just two cases is impossible. Nevertheless, the modified most likely research design used in this article weakens confidence in the strength of diversionary arguments. Diversion as a principal or primary source of some conflicts may be much less frequent than scholars assert. These two episodes should be among the easiest cases for diversion to explain. Not only did embattled leaders escalate disputes into crises and then use force, but scholars have also viewed these cases as being best explained by diversionary mechanisms. If diversion cannot account for these decisions, it is unclear what the hypothesis can in fact explain. My findings have several implications for the literature on diversionary war theory. At the most general level of analysis, the lack of support for the diversion hypothesis in Argentina and Turkey complements those quantitative studies of diversion that do not identify a systematic and significant relationship between domestic politics and aggressive foreign policies, including the use of force.127 In addition, the modified most likely research design used in this article raises questions about those quantitative studies that do provide empirical support for diversion because it demonstrates that despite the presence of domestic unrest, the underlying causal mechanisms of diversion may not account for the decisions to use force. The lack of support for diversion raises a simple but important question: why is diversion less frequent than commonly believed, despite its plausible intuition? Although further research is required, several factors should be considered. First, the rally effect that leaders enjoy from an international crisis is generally brief in duration and unlikely to change permanently a public’s overall satisfaction with its leaders.128 George H. W. Bush, for example, lost his reelection bid after successful prosecution of the 1991 Gulf War. Winston Churchill fared no better after the Allied victory in World War II.129 Leaders have little reason to conclude that a short-term rally will address what are usually structural sources of domestic dissatisfaction. 127 Second, a selection effect may prevent embattled leaders from choosing diversion. Diversionary action should produce the largest rally effect against the most powerful target because such action would reflect a leader’s skills through coercing a superior opponent. At the same time, leaders should often be deterred from challenging stronger targets, as the imbalance of military forces increases the risk of defeat and thus the probability of losing office at home. Although the odds of victory increase when targeting weaker states, success should have a much more muted effect on domestic support, if any, because victory would have been expected.130 Third, weak or embattled leaders can choose from a wide range of policy options to strengthen their standing at home. Although scholars such as Oakes and Gelpi have noted that embattled leaders can choose repression or economic development in addition to diversionary action, the range of options is even greater and carries less risk than the failure of diversion. Weak leaders can also seek to deepen cooperation with other states if they believe it will strengthen their position at home. Other studies, for example, have demonstrated that political unrest facilitated détente among the superpowers in the early 1970s, China’s concessions in its many territorial disputes, support for international financial liberalization, and the formation of regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian States and the Gulf Cooperation Council.131 The findings from these two cases also carry implications for future empirical tests of the diversionary hypothesis and the broader relationship between internal and external conflict. To start, given the common view within the field of international relations that some past conflicts are best explained by diversionary motives, additional case studies are needed to test diversionary claims against plausible alternative explanations. In other cases that scholars have cast as diversionary, for example, evidence exists that casts doubt upon the hypothesis. Historian Arno Mayer, among others, is often cited as providing support for diversion through his argument that domestic crises accounted for key decisions leading to the outbreak of World War I (as well as other conflicts) in Europe.132 Yet in his analysis of German decision making before 1914, Dale Copeland finds leadership statements that disconfirm the diversionary hypothesis. As early as 1905-06, for instance, Admiral Tirpitz concluded that war in Europe would only “cause chaos at home,” not increase societal cohesion.133 Similarly, the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese war is often mentioned as another example of diversion. One of the key pieces of evidence to support his claim comes from a memoir of a Russian official, Count Sergei Witte, who quotes V. K. Pleve, minister of the interior at the time, as stating that “we need a little victorious war to stem the tide of revolution.”134 Geoffrey Blainey notes, however, numerous problems with this statement as evidence of Russian decision making: the quote appeared in a memoir that was penned eight years later, Witte and Pleve were rivals, and Witte in other parts of the memoir that analyzes the war includes no other statements that would support a diversionary explanation.135 These two examples suggest that a thorough audit of other diversionary cases would be helpful. In addition, although smoking-gun evidence in leadership statements may be impossible to find, scholars can use case study methods to test diversionary arguments against alternative explanations. In particular, scholars can trace changes in the domestic political environment with foreign policy decision making to identify a clear relationship between domestic political strife and plans to threaten or use force. Scholars can also examine leadership statements for evidence consistent with diversion, such as concern about their domestic political standing or the anticipated effects of an external conflict on domestic politics. At the same time, my findings also underscore the importance of including appropriate international-level variables in quantitative models of diversion. The inclusion of such variables not only ensures that appropriate scope conditions for the diversionary use of force are present, but they can also control for alternative explanations driven by changes in a state’s international environment. In some cross-national studies, for example, international-level variables are excluded.136 Those studies that do include such variables use them as controls for a state’s ability to engage in diversionary behavior such as relative capabilities and major power status or opportunity structures for diversion such as an enduring rivalry or ongoing crisis.137 Very few studies include variables that measure a state’s threat environment or other states’ efforts to change the status quo, actions that might also account for dispute escalation.138 Finally, even though external security challenges explain the Argentine and Turkish decisions better than diversion, the presence of domestic unrest in both episodes suggests a new avenue for research on the relationship between internal and external conflict. Drawing upon Hein Goemans’ study of war termination, leaders with low levels of public support may have additional incentives to use force when confronting external security threats than leaders with comparatively high levels of support.139 If weak leaders fail to defend their states’ interests abroad, they are even more likely to face punishment at home. In this way, the degree of domestic support that a leader enjoys might function as an intervening or mediating variable that increases the magnitude of the incentive to use force when threatened or challenged by another state. This possible effect, however, is not a diversionary one, as domestic unrest does not create an independent incentive for leaders to deflect attention abroad through the use of force. If the effect of domestic conflict is to magnify or enlarge existing incentives for escalation created by the international environment, new specifications of quantitative models of diversion should also be considered. In current models, indicators of domestic conflict are usually included as a separate variable, suggesting that diversionary factors exert linear additive effects on the odds of conflict. If, however, the effect of domestic strife is conditional, then diversionary factors are perhaps more appropriately modeled as a multiplicative interaction term.140 New specifications might account for the mixed results that past quantitative tests have revealed.

741089,The alternative is to reject the 1AC. Voting negative is a refusal of their practice of legalism in favor of a process of study that unmasks legal violence,Snoek ‘12,Snoek ‘12,"study is an important strategy for living outside the law and making it inoperative The study Agamben is aiming at does not have a predetermined goal: getting a degree and a good position in society, or getting some valuable insight that can be used to overthrow a political structure. Just as the strategy to close the door of the law was especially hard because the law does not prescribe anything and the task of the Messiah is paradoxical because there is no original structure of the law to restore, so study also lacks a transcendent meaning it can aim at, a goal it can set Here Agamben sees a close affinity with Aristotle’s description of potentiality, which is passive on the one hand — an undergoing — and active on the other — an unstoppable drive to undertake something, to do something, to engage in action. Study is the place where undergoing and undertaking converge; it is a gesture The rhythm of studying is an alternation between amazement and clarity, discovery and loss, doing and undergoing. This combination of undergoing and undertaking yields a kind of passive activity, a radical passivity. Something happens without seeming to happen. Agamben argues that study is pre-eminently unending. Study does not have an appropriate end nor does it desire it. This gives the scholar a woeful air. The student cannot really help him either; he does not offer Karl any insight in what he must do and even advises him to remain with Delamarche ‘absolutely33 Karl wonders where studying had got him [or her] — he [or she] had forgotten everything again 34 The most extreme example of a student the scriber who stopped writing they have stopped writing or that they have lost the object of study the students can no longer decipher it Their commentaries on the Schrift, on the Law, are notes in the margin of a blank page.35 Study does not lead to an a priori determined goal study has gone beyond itself. Its gesture is that of a power that does not precede but follows its action, which it has left behind forever ‘At this point, study shakes off the sadness that disfigured it and returns to its truest nature: not work, but inspiration, the self-nourishment of the soul’ that law is set over against myth in the name of justice: instead of taking part in the mythical (pre-law) struggle the goal is to unmask mythical-juridical violence and human beings must tame the mythical forces at whatever cost what is new about this ‘new lawyer what is new for the legal profession, is that he does not practice law but only studies it, reading in tranquil lamplight.

According to Agamben, study is an important strategy for living outside the law and making it inoperative. In what sense can study be a strategy? Study has a long tradition in Judaism as a form of resistance. In 586 BC, Jerusalem was plundered by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar and the temple of the Jews destroyed. Many Jews died and the rest were taken captive and brought to Babylonia. During the Babylonian exile, when they no longer had a temple and were forbidden to practise their faith, the Jewish people focused on the study of their holy books. After the Persian king Cyrus defeated Babylonia and issued a decree in 537 BC that the exiled Jews could return to their homelands and rebuild their holy sanctuaries, 40,000 Jews returned to rebuild the temple. But the religion of the Jews was already marked by exile and in 70 AD the temple was again destroyed, this time by the Romans. The temple was not rebuilt and study has since then become the true temple of the Jews. The Jewish religion is no longer focused on worship but on study. This gave the scholar a messianic significance (IP, 63). Talmud means ‘study’; the original meaning of Torah is not ‘law’ but ‘instruction’ Mishnan, the set of rabbinic laws, is derived from a root that has ‘repetition’ as its basic meaning. The study Agamben is aiming at does not have a predetermined goal: getting a degree and a good position in society, or getting some valuable insight that can be used to overthrow a political structure. Just as the strategy to close the door of the law was especially hard because the law does not prescribe anything and the task of the Messiah is paradoxical because there is no original structure of the law to restore, so study also lacks a transcendent meaning it can aim at, a goal it can set. As far as etymology is concerned, the word studium is closely related to a root that indicates a coffision, a shock or influence. Study and surprise are closely related in that sense. Whoever studies finds oneself shocked, amazed and is, in a certain sense, stupid (cf. studium, stupefying). On the one hand, study is undergone and, on the other, undertaken. Here Agamben sees a close affinity with Aristotle’s description of potentiality, which is passive on the one hand — an undergoing — and active on the other — an unstoppable drive to undertake something, to do something, to engage in action. Study is the place where undergoing and undertaking converge; it is a gesture (IP, 64). The rhythm of studying is an alternation between amazement and clarity, discovery and loss, doing and undergoing. This combination of undergoing and undertaking yields a kind of passive activity, a radical passivity. Something happens without seeming to happen. Agamben argues that study is pre-eminently unending. Study does not have an appropriate end nor does it desire it. This gives the scholar a woeful air. At first glance, the students in Kafka’s works seem to be of little use or significance. Nevertheless, Benjamin contends that they have a major role to play: ‘Among Kafka’s creations, there is a clan which reckons with the brevity of life in a peculiar way. The students who appear in the strangest places in Kafka’s works are the spokesmen for and leaders of this clan3° Agamben is in complete agreement with this view: [T]he latest, most exemplary embodiment of study in our culture is not the great philosopher nor the sainted doctor. It is rather the student, such as he appears in certain novels of Kafka or Walser. (IP, 65) It is precisely the apparent uselessness of the students and the hopelessness of study that plays such an important role in the strategy they develop with respect to power. Kafka’s useless students without Schrift So the students operating in Kafkas stories have an important characteristic: their studies seem to be useless. In Amerika, Karl sees a strange young man: He watched silently as the man read in his book, turned the pages and occasionally checked something in another book that he always picked up at lightning speed, often making entries in a notebook, his face always bent surprisingly low over it. Could this man be a student? He did seem to be studying. ... ‘You’re studying?’ asked Karl. ‘Yes, yes’, said the man, using the few moments lost to his studies to rearrange his books.3’ (...) And when wifi you be finished with your studies?’ asked Karl. ‘It’s slow going’, said the student. ... ‘[Y]ou can be happy about having given up your studies. I myself have been studying for years, out of pure single-mindedness. It has given me little satisfaction and even less chance of a decent future. 32 Karl explains his problems with Delamarche to the student. The student cannot really help him either; he does not offer Karl any insight in what he must do and even advises him to remain with Delamarche ‘absolutely33 Karl wonders where studying had got him [or her] — he [or she] had forgotten everything again.34 The most extreme example of a student, in Agamben’s view, is MelvillËs Bartleby, the scriber who stopped writing. According to Benjamin, Kafkas students have also lost the Schrift. This can mean either that they have stopped writing or that they have lost the Schrift in the sense of the Torah, the object of study. According to Scholem, the students have not lost the Schrift or the Torah, but they can no longer decipher it (cited in HS, 51). Nonetheless, Benjamin’s genius is apparent, according to Agamben, precisely in the fact that the students have lost the Schrift. Their commentaries on the Schrift, on the Law, are notes in the margin of a blank page.35 Study does not lead to an a priori determined goal; Kafka does not attach any promises to study that are traditionally attached to the study of the Torah. According to Agamben, the messianic tension of study is turned around here. Or better: it has gone beyond itself. Its gesture is that of a power that does not precede but follows its action, which it has left behind forever, of a Talmud that has not only announced the reconstruction of the temple but has already forgotten it. ‘At this point, study shakes off the sadness that disfigured it and returns to its truest nature: not work, but inspiration, the self-nourishment of the soul’ (IP, 65).36 Kafkas assistants are members of a congregation who have lost their house of prayer. His students have forgotten how to write, have lost the Schrift. Now nothing stops them on their ‘[u]ntrammeled, happy journey:37 The study of the horse Bucephalus But the most enigmatic example of the student in Kafkas work may be Alexander the Great’s horse Bucephalus, who happens to become a lawyer to the surprise of his colleagues. We have a new lawyer, Dr. Bucephalus. In his outward appearance there is little to recall the time when he was the warhorse of Alexander of Macedonia. ... I recently saw a quite simple court usher with the knowing eye of a little racetrack regular marveffing at the lawyer as the latter, lifting his thighs high, mounted step by step with a stride that made the marble clang. In general the bar approves the admission of Bucephalus. ... Nowadays, as no one can deny, there is no great Alexander. To be sure, many know how to commit murder ... and many feel that Macedonia is too narrow ... but no one, no one, can lead the way to India. Even in those days India’s gates were beyond reach, but their direction was indicated by the royal sword. ... Today ... no one shows the way; many carry swords but only wave them in the air and the gaze that tries to follow them grows confused. Perhaps, therefore, it is really best, as Bucephalus has done, to immerse oneself in law books. Free, his flanks unburdened by the loins of the rider, by quiet lamplight, far from the tumult of Alexander’s baffle, he reads and turns the pages of our old books.38 In his interpretation of this story, Werner Kraft concludes that law is set over against myth in the name of justice: instead of taking part in the mythical (pre-law) struggle, Bucephalus devotes himself to law.39 Benjamin sees this as a serious misunderstanding of Kafkas story. Indeed, the goal is to unmask mythical-juridical violence and human beings, like the horse Bucephalus, must tame the mythical forces at whatever cost (SE, 63). But, according to Benjamin, what is new about this ‘new lawyer what is new for the legal profession, is that he does not practice law but only studies it, reading in tranquil lamplight. Bucephalus is free: his flanks are no longer squeezed by Alexander the Great’s thighs and he is no longer carrying the latter on his back. The door to justice is not to employ law but to make it inoperative — not by practicing law (which would be a repetition of the mythical forces, given that law is in force without significance), but by doing nothing more than studying it. ‘The law which is studied but no longer practiced is the gate to justice.

This is a law that is liberated from all discipline and all relation to sovereignty. Bucephalus depicts a figure of the law that is possible after its link with violence and power has been deposed, a law that is no longer in force and applied (SE, 63-64), just as the study of doorkeepers by the man from the country makes it possible to remain living outside the law. Agamben then outlines the following picture of the future: One day humanity will play with law just as children play with disused objects, not in order to restore them to their canonical use, but to free them from it for good.

Ever since Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented move to legalize recreational pot last year, excitement and stories of unfettered success have billowed into the air. Colorado's marijuana tax revenue far exceeded expectations, bringing a whopping $185 million to the state and tourists are lining up to taste the budding culture (pun intended). Several other states are now looking to follow suit and legalize.  But the ramifications of this momentous shift are left unaddressed. When you flick on the TV to a segment about the flowering pot market in Colorado, you'll find that the faces of the movement are primarily white and male. Meanwhile, many of the more than 210,000 people who were arrested for marijuana possession in Colorado between 1986 and 2010 according to a report from the Marijuana Arrest Research Project, remain behind bars. Thousands of black men and boys still sit in prisons for possession of the very plant that's making those white guys on TV rich. “In many ways the imagery doesn't sit right,” said Michelle Alexander, associate professor of law at Ohio State University and author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness in a public conversation on March 6 with Asha Bandele of the Drug Policy Alliance. “Here are white men poised to run big marijuana businesses, dreaming of cashing in big—big money, big businesses selling weed—after 40 years of impoverished black kids getting prison time for selling weed, and their families and futures destroyed. Now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?” Alexander said she is “thrilled” that Colorado and Washington have legalized pot and that Washington D.C. decriminalized possession of small amounts earlier this month. But she said she’s noticed ""warning signs"" of a troubling trend emerging in the pot legalization movement: Whites—men in particular—are the face of the movement, and the emerging pot industry. (A recent In These Times article titled “ The Unbearable Whiteness of Marijuana Legalization,” summarize this trend.) Alexander said for 40 years poor communities of color have experienced the wrath of the war on drugs. “Black men and boys” have been the target of the war on drugs’ racist policies—stopped, frisked and disturbed—“often before they’re old enough to vote,” she said. Those youths are arrested most often for nonviolent first offenses that would go ignored in middle-class white neighborhoods. “We arrest these kids at young ages, saddle them with criminal records, throw them in cages, and then release them into a parallel social universe in which the very civil and human rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights movement no longer apply to them for the rest of their lives,” she said. “They can be discriminated against [when it comes to] employment, housing, access to education, public benefits. They're locked into a permanent second-class status

for life. And we’ve done this in precisely the communities that were most in need of our support.” As Asha Bandele of DPA pointed out during the conversation, the U.S. has 5% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s prisoners. Today, 2.2 million people are in prison or jail and 7.7 million are under the control of the criminal justice system, with African American boys and men—and now women—making up a disproportionate number of those imprisoned. Alexander’s book was published four years ago and spent 75 weeks on the New York Timesbestseller list, helping to bring mass incarceration to the forefront of the national discussion. Alexander said over the last four years, as she’s been traveling from state to state speaking to audiences from prisons to universities about her book, she’s witnessed an “awakening.” More and more people are talking about mass incarceration, racism and the war on drugs. Often when people talk about the reasons certain communities are impoverished or lack education they blame the personal choices or moral shortcomings of the people in those communities, but that way of looking at things has got it backwards, she said. “That these communities are poor and have failing schools and have broken rules is not because of their personal failings but because we’ve declared war on them,” she said. “We’ve spent billions of dollars building prisons and allowing schools to fail. We’ve decimated these communities by shuttling young people from their underfunded schools to these brand new, high tech prisons. We’ve begun targeting children in these communities at young ages.” Alexander cautioned that drug policy activists need to keep this disparity in mind and cultivate a conversation about repairing the damages done by the systemic racism of the war on drugs, before cashing in on legalization. “After waging a brutal war on poor communities of color, a drug war that has decimated families, spread despair and hopelessness through entire communities, and a war that has fanned the flames of the very violence it was supposedly intended to address and control; after pouring billions of dollars into prisons and allowing schools to fail; we’re gonna simply say, we’re done now?” Alexander said. “I think we have to be willing, as we’re talking about legalization, to also start talking about reparations for the war on drugs, how to repair the harm caused.” Alexander used the example of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa to point out the way a society can and should own up to its past mistakes. After apartheid ended, the nation passed a law called the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. Under the new law, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed to ""elicit truth"" about the human rights violations that had occurred. The commission recorded the statements of witnesses who endured ""gross human rights violations"" and facilitated public hearings. Those who had committed violence could request amnesty from civil and criminal prosecution in order to share testimony about what they'd done with the commission. “At the end of apartheid in South Africa there was an understanding that there could be no healing, no progress, no reconciliation without truth,” she said. “You can’t just destroy a people and then say ‘It’s over, we’re stopping now.’ You have to be willing to deal with the truth, deal with the history openly and honestly.” Alexander pointed to America’s tendency to shove its racist legacies under the rug rather than own up to them. When the civil war ended, slaves were free on paper but they were left with nothing—“no 40 acres and a mule, nothing,” Alexander said. The only option was to work low-paying contract jobs for the same slave owners who had previously brutalized them. “And after a brief period of reconstruction a new caste system was imposed—Jim Crow—and another extraordinary movement arose and brought the old Jim Crow to its knees,” she said. “Americans said, OK, we’ll stop now. We’ll take down the whites-only signs, we’ll stop doing that. But there were not reparations for slavery, not for Jim Crow, and scarcely an acknowledgement of the harm done except for Martin Luther King Day, one day out of the year. And I feel like, here we go again.” Last week, Obama pushed out an initiative called My Brother’s Keeper, focused on helping black boys who have fallen down the social ladder. Alexander said she’s glad Obama is shining a spotlight on the crisis facing black communities. However, she said Obama has perpetuated the backward way of framing the situation when he talks about the issues facing those communities. ""I am worried that much of the initiative is more based in rhetoric than in meaningful commitment to address the structures and institutions that have created the conditions in these communities,"" she said. Asked about the unlikely relationship forming between U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and Kentucky’s Tea Party senator Rand Paul, both of whom are standing together to end mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders, Alexander responded she is wary of whether these politicians are making the right decisions for the wrong reasons. She cautioned that politicians across the political spectrum are “highly motivated” to downsize prisons because the U.S. can no longer afford to maintain a massive prison state without raising taxes “on the predominantly white middle class.” That shortsighted way of thinking fails to recognize the larger societal patterns that keep the U.S. cycling through various “caste-like” systems. “If we're going to downsize these prisons and change marijuana laws and all that, in order to save some cash, but in that process to change these laws, we haven't woken up to the magnitude of the harm that we have done,” she said. “Ultimately, at least from my perspective, this movement to end mass incarceration and this movement to end the drug war is about breaking our nation’s habit of creating caste-like systems in America,” she said. She added that regardless of whether they’re struggling with addiction and drug abuse or have a felony on their record, people deserve to be treated with basic human rights. “How were we able to permanently lock out of mainstream society tens of millions of people, destroy families?” she said. “If we’re not going to have a real conversation about that and ultimately be willing to care for ‘them,’ the ‘others,’ those ‘ghetto dwellers’ who’ve been demonized in this rush to declare war, we’re going to find ourselves years from now either still having a slightly downsized system of mass incarceration that continues to hum along very well, or we will have managed to downsize our prisons but some new system of racial and social control will have emerged again because we have not yet learned the core lesson that our racial history has been trying to teach us.”",9957.0,"<h4>Legalization does not nothing to affect the structure of anti-blackness- the movement is an attempt to profit off of the drug war which upholds the policing power of civil society</h4><p>--skirts question of reparations and racial violence in favor of making the rich get richer</p><p><u><strong>Short ’14</u></strong> (April, Associate Editor at AlterNet, “Michelle Alexander: White Men Get Rich from Legal Pot, Black Men Stay in Prison<u><mark>”, [SG]) </p><p></u></mark>Ever since Colorado and Washington made the unprecedented move to legalize recreational pot last year, excitement and stories of unfettered success have billowed into the air.

Now, white men are planning to get rich doing precisely the same thing?”</u> Alexander said she is “thrilled” that Colorado and Washington have legalized pot and that Washington D.C. decriminalized possession of small amounts earlier this month. But she said she’s noticed ""warning signs"" of a troubling trend emerging in the pot legalization movement: Whites—men in particular—are the face of the movement, and the emerging pot industry. (A recent In These Times article titled “ The Unbearable Whiteness of Marijuana Legalization,” summarize this trend.) Alexander said <u><mark>for 40 years poor communities of color have experienced the wrath of the war on drugs</mark>. “Black men and boys” have been the target of the war on drugs’ <mark>racist policies—stopped, frisked and disturbed</mark>—“often before they’re old enough to vote,”</u> she said. Those youths are arrested most often for nonviolent first offenses that would go ignored in middle-class white neighborhoods. “We arrest these kids at young ages, saddle them with criminal records, throw them in cages, and then release them into a parallel social universe in which the very civil and human rights supposedly won in the Civil Rights movement no longer apply to them for the rest of their lives,” she said. “<u>They can be discriminated against [when it comes to] employment, housing, access to education, public benefits. <mark>They're locked into a permanent second-class status</p><p></mark>MARKED</p><p><mark> for life</mark>. And we’ve done this in precisely the communities that were most in need of our support.”</u> As Asha Bandele of DPA pointed out during the conversation, the U.S. has 5% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s prisoners. Today, 2.2 million people are in prison or jail and 7.7 million are under the control of the criminal justice system, with African American boys and men—and now women—making up a disproportionate number of those imprisoned. Alexander’s book was published four years ago and spent 75 weeks on the New York Timesbestseller list, helping to bring mass incarceration to the forefront of the national discussion. Alexander said over the last four years, as she’s been traveling from state to state speaking to audiences from prisons to universities about her book, she’s witnessed an “awakening.” More and more people are talking about mass incarceration, racism and the war on drugs. Often when people talk about the reasons certain communities are impoverished or lack education they blame the personal choices or moral shortcomings of the people in those communities, but that way of looking at things has got it backwards, she said. “<u>That these communities are poor and have failing schools and have broken rules is not because of their personal failings but because <mark>we’ve declared war on them,”</mark> </u>she said. “We’ve spent billions of dollars building prisons and allowing schools to fail. We’ve decimated these communities by shuttling young people from their underfunded schools to these brand new, high tech prisons. We’ve begun targeting children in these communities at young ages.” Alexander cautioned that drug policy activists need to keep this disparity in mind and cultivate a conversation about repairing the damages done by the systemic racism of the war on drugs, before cashing in on legalization. “<u>After waging a brutal war on poor communities of color, a drug war that has decimated families, spread despair and hopelessness through entire communities, and a war that has fanned the flames of the very violence it was supposedly intended to address and control; after pouring billions of dollars into prisons and allowing schools to fail; we’re gonna simply say, we’re done now?”</u> Alexander said. <u>“I think <mark>we have to be willing</mark>, as we’re talking about legalization, <mark>to also start talking about reparations for the war on drugs,</mark> how to repair the harm caused</u>.” Alexander used the example of post-apartheid reparations in South Africa to point out the way a society can and should own up to its past mistakes. After apartheid ended, the nation passed a law called the Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act of 1995. Under the new law, a Truth and Reconciliation Commission was formed to ""elicit truth"" about the human rights violations that had occurred. The commission recorded the statements of witnesses who endured ""gross human rights violations"" and facilitated public hearings. Those who had committed violence could request amnesty from civil and criminal prosecution in order to share testimony about what they'd done with the commission. “At the end of apartheid in South Africa there was an understanding that there could be no healing, no progress, no reconciliation without truth,” she said. “You can’t just destroy a people and then say ‘It’s over, we’re stopping now.’ You have to be willing to deal with the truth, deal with the history openly and honestly.” Alexander pointed to America’s tendency to shove its racist legacies under the rug rather than own up to them. When the civil war ended, slaves were free on paper but they were left with nothing—“no 40 acres and a mule, nothing,” Alexander said. The only option was to work low-paying contract jobs for the same slave owners who had previously brutalized them. “And after a brief period of reconstruction a new caste system was imposed—Jim Crow—and another extraordinary movement arose and brought the old Jim Crow to its knees,” she said. “Americans said, OK, we’ll stop now. We’ll take down the whites-only signs, we’ll stop doing that. But there were not reparations for slavery, not for Jim Crow, and scarcely an acknowledgement of the harm done except for Martin Luther King Day, one day out of the year. And I feel like, here we go again.” Last week, Obama pushed out an initiative called My Brother’s Keeper, focused on helping black boys who have fallen down the social ladder. Alexander said she’s glad Obama is shining a spotlight on the crisis facing black communities. However, she said <u><mark>Obama has perpetuated the backward way of framing the situation</mark> when he talks about the issues facing those communities. ""I am worried that much of <mark>the initiative is more based in rhetoric than in meaningful commitment to address the structures and institutions that have created the conditions in these communities</u></mark>,"" she said.

Brown (1995) positions herself within thedebate about identity politics by seeking to elaborate on “the wounded character of politicised identity’s desire” (ibid: 55); thatis, the problem of “wounded attachments” whereby a claim to identity becomes over-invested in its own historical suffering and perpetuates its injury through its refusal to give up its identity claim. Brown’s argument is that where politicised identity is founded upon an experience of exclusion, for example, exclusion itself becomes perversely valorised in the continuance of that identity. In such cases, group activity operates to maintain and reproduce the identity created by injury (exclusion) rather than– and indeed, often in opposition to – resolving the injurious social relations that generated claims around that identity in the ﬁrst place. If things have to have a history in order to have af uture, then the problem becomes that of how history is con-structed in order to make the future. To the extent that, for Brown, identity is associated primarily with (historical) injury, the future for that identity is then already determined by the injury “as both bound to the history that produced it and as a reproach to the present which embodies that history” (ibid 1995: 73). Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. Politicised identity, Brown maintains, “emerges and obtains its unifying coherence through the politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal, as a protest against exclusion” (ibid: 65). Its continuing existence requires both a belief in the legitimacy of the universal ideal (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) and enduring exclusion from those ideals. Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that such identi-ties, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment andinequality, then become invested in their own impotence through practices of, for example, reproach, complaint, and revenge. These are “reactions” in the Nietzschean sense since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. Rather than acting to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering is instead ameliorated (to some extent) through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue” (ibid 1995:70), and is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimi-nation. Such practices, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, provide obstacles to – practices that would seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion. Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past. This is because for those who have suffered oppression and exclusion, the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible to meet. We would argue instead that the “turn to the future” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient, who is doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget and to forget in order to be able to live in the present. 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past. Indeed, this wouldseem to be similar to the message of Beloved , whose central motif of haunting (is the adult woman, “Beloved”, Sethe’s murderedchild returned in spectral form?) dramatises the tendency of theunanalysed traumatic past to keep on returning, constraining, asit does so, the present to be like the past, and thereby, disallow-ing the possibility of a future different from that past. As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “in order to break the seal of the past, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, we must ﬁrst bring them into the realm of political action” (2004: 33). We would add that the task of analys-ing the traumatic past, and thus opening up the possibility of political action, is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but that this, instead, requires a “community” of participants dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. The “pain” of historical injury is not simply an individual psychological issue, but stems from objective social conditions which perpetuate, for the most part, forms of injustice and inequality into the present. In sum, Brown presents too stark a choice between past andfuture. In the example of Beloved with which we began thisarticle, Paul D’s acceptance of Sethe’s experiences of slavery asdistinct from his own, enable them both to arrive at new under-standings of their experience. Such understanding is a way of partially “undoing” the (effects of) the past and coming to terms with the locatedness of one’s being in the world (Mohanty 1995). As this example shows, opening up a future, and attending to theongoing effects of a traumatic past, are only incorrectly under-stood as alternatives. A second set of problems with Brown’s critique of identity poli-tics emerge from what we regard as her tendency to individualise social problems as problems that are the possession and theresponsibility of the “wounded” group. Brown suggests that the problems associated with identity politics can be overcome through a “shift in the character of political expression and politi-cal claims common to much politicised identity” (1995: 75). She deﬁnes this shift as one in which identity would be expressed in terms of desire rather than of ontology by supplanting the lan-guage of “I am” with the language of “I want this for us” (1995:75). Such a reconﬁguration, she argues, would create an opportu-nity to “rehabilitate the memory of desire within identiﬁcatory processes…prior to [their] wounding” (1995: 75). It would fur-ther refocus attention on the future possibilities present in the identity as opposed to the identity being foreclosed through its attention to past-based grievances.",10031.0,"<h4>Starting politics from the standpoint of an excluded identity-group is a <u>vengeful politics of resentment</u> – it can only position itself <u>reactively</u> against an <u>ostensible universal</u> like Whiteness, inevitably <u>re-instating</u> the terms of oppression</h4><p><strong>Bhambra 10</strong> – U Warwick—AND—Victoria Margree—School of Humanities, U Brighton (Identity Politics and the Need for a ‘Tomorrow’, http://www.academia.edu/471824/Identity_Politics_and_the_Need_for_a_Tomorrow_)</p><p>2 The Reification of Identity We wish to turn now to a related problem within identity politicsthat can be best described as the problem of <u><strong><mark>the reiﬁcation of politicised identities</u></strong></mark>.

Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that <u>this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche</u>” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that <u>remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient,</u> who is <u>doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget</u> <u>and to forget in order to be able to live in the present.</u> 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past. Indeed, this wouldseem to be similar to the message of Beloved , whose central motif of haunting (is the adult woman, “Beloved”, Sethe’s murderedchild returned in spectral form?) dramatises the tendency of theunanalysed traumatic past to keep on returning, constraining, asit does so, the present to be like the past, and thereby, disallow-ing the possibility of a future different from that past. As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “<u><strong><mark>in order to break the seal of the past</u></strong></mark>, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, <u><strong><mark>we must</mark> ﬁrst <mark>bring them into the realm of political action</u></strong></mark>” (2004: 33). We would add that <u>the task of <mark>analys-ing</mark> <mark>the</mark> traumatic <mark>past, and</u></mark> thus <u><mark>opening</mark> up the possibility of <mark>political action, is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but </mark>that this, instead, <mark>requires a “community” of participants</u></mark> dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. <u><mark>The “pain” of historical injury is not simply an individual psychological issue, but stems from</mark> objective <mark>social conditions which perpetuate</mark>, for the most part, forms of <mark>injustice</mark> and inequality into the present. </u>In sum, Brown presents too stark a choice between past andfuture. In the example of Beloved with which we began thisarticle, Paul D’s acceptance of Sethe’s experiences of slavery asdistinct from his own, enable them both to arrive at new under-standings of their experience. Such understanding is a way of partially “undoing” the (effects of) the past and coming to terms with the locatedness of one’s being in the world (Mohanty 1995). As this example shows, opening up a future, and attending to theongoing effects of a traumatic past, are only incorrectly under-stood as alternatives. A second set of problems with Brown’s critique of identity poli-tics emerge from what we regard as her tendency to individualise social problems as problems that are the possession and theresponsibility of the “wounded” group. Brown suggests that <u><mark>the problems associated with identity politics can be overcome</mark> <mark>through a “shift</mark> in the character of political expression</u> and politi-cal claims common to much politicised identity” (1995: 75). She deﬁnes this shift as one <u><mark>in which identity would be expressed in terms of <strong>desire rather than of ontology by supplanting the lan-guage of “I am” with the language of “I want this for</mark> <mark>us</mark>” </u></strong>(1995:75). Such a reconﬁguration, she argues, would create an opportu-nity to “rehabilitate the memory of desire within identiﬁcatory processes…prior to [their] wounding” (1995: 75). <u><strong><mark>It would</mark> fur-ther <mark>refocus attention on the future possibilities</mark> present in the identity <mark>as opposed to the identity</mark> <mark>being foreclosed through its attention to past-based grievances</u></strong></mark>.</p>",1NC,,Case,127857,114,17133,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/HaFi/Emory-Hall-Fiero-Neg-Harvard-Round1.docx,565496,N,Harvard,1,Liberty Chiri-Edwards,Tomik,"1AC Thickness

These were seen to breed terrorism, regional chaos, crime, disease, and environmental catastrophe. To deal with such problems at their roots, the argument ran, the United States had to reach out and help stabilize the countries in question, engaging in state building on a neo-imperial scale. And reach out the United States did -- most obviously during the protracted campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. After a decade of conflict and effort with precious little to show for it, however, the recent era of interventionist U.S. state building is drawing to a close. And although there are practical reasons for this shift -- the United States can no longer afford such missions, and the public has tired of them -- the decline of the state-building narrative reflects a more profound underlying truth: the obsession with weak states was always more of a mania than a sound strategic doctrine. Its passing will not leave the United States more isolationist and vulnerable but rather free the country to focus on its more important global roles.  THE BIRTH OF A PARADIGM  In the wake of the Cold War, contemplating a largely benign security environment, many U.S. national security strategists and practitioners concluded that the most important risks were posed by the fragility of state structures and recommended profound shifts in U.S. foreign and defense policy as a result. In an interconnected world, they argued, chaos, violence, and grievances anywhere had the potential to affect U.S. interests, and weak states were factories of such volatility. Experiences in Somalia, Haiti, and the former Yugoslavia helped fuel the concern, and by 1994, the CIA was funding a state-failure task force to get a handle on the problem.  In 1997, the Clinton administration released Presidential Decision Directive 56, “Managing Complex Contingency Operations,” which began with the assertion that “in the wake of the Cold War, attention has focused on a rising number of territorial disputes, armed ethnic conflicts, and civil wars that pose threats to regional and international peace.” A new focus of U.S. policy, accordingly, would be responding to such situations with “multi-dimensional operations composed of such components as political/diplomatic, humanitarian, intelligence, economic development, and security.”  Critics of a realist persuasion objected to the emerging narrative, arguing that the Clinton administration’s forays into state building in peripheral areas represented a strategic folly. And during his 2000 presidential campaign, George W. Bush ran as the candidate of foreign policy humility, arguing in part that nation building was a dangerous distraction. His adviser Condoleezza Rice grumbled that U.S. troops should not be asked to escort toddlers to school; his vice presidential candidate, Dick Cheney, suggested that a Bush administration would end U.S. participation in Balkan operations; and the day before the election, Bush himself declared, “Let me tell you what else I’m worried about: I’m worried about an opponent who uses ‘nation building’ and ‘the military’ in the same sentence.”  But the 9/11 attacks swept these hesitations aside, as the practical implications of an interventionist “war on terror” became apparent. The first page of the Bush administration’s 2002 National Security Strategy argued that “America is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few.”  The new consensus was bipartisan. The Democratic foreign policy hand Susan Rice, for example, wrote in 2003 that Bush was “wise to draw attention to the significant threats to our national security posed by failed and failing states.” Where the right emphasized security and terrorism, the left added humanitarian concerns. Development specialists jumped on the bandwagon as well, thanks to new studies that highlighted the importance of institutions and good governance as requirements for sustained economic success. In his 2004 book, State-Building, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama wrote, “Weak and failing states have arguably become the single most important problem for international order.” The Washington Post editorialized the same year that “weak states can compromise security -- most obviously by providing havens for terrorists but also by incubating organized crime, spurring waves of migrants, and undermining global efforts to control environmental threats and disease.” This argument, the paper concluded, “is no longer much contested.” A year later, the State Department’s director of policy planning, Stephen Krasner, and its newly minted coordinator for reconstruction and stabilization, Carlos Pascual, argued in these pages that “in today’s increasingly interconnected world, weak and failed states pose an acute risk to U.S. and global security. Indeed, they present one of the most important foreign policy challenges of the contemporary era.”  From one angle, the concern with weak states could be seen as a response to actual conditions on the ground. Problems had always festered in disordered parts of the developing world. Without great- power conflict as an urgent national security priority, those problems were more clearly visible and harder to ignore. From another angle, it could be seen as a classic meme -- a concept or intellectual fad riding to prominence through social diffusion, articles by prominent thinkers, a flurry of attention from the mainstream press, and a series of foundation grants, think-tank projects, roundtables, and conferences.  From a third angle, however, it could be seen as a solution to an unusual concern confronting U.S. policymakers in this era: what to do with a surplus of national power. The United States entered the 1990s with a dominant international position and no immediate threats. Embracing a substantially reduced U.S. global role would have required a fundamental reassessment of the prevailing consensus in favor of continued primacy, something few in or around the U.S. national security establishment were prepared to consider. Instead, therefore, whether consciously or not, that establishment generated a new rationale for global engagement, one involving the application of power and influence to issues that at any other time would have been seen as secondary or tertiary. Without a near-peer competitor (or several) to deter or a major war on the horizon, Washington found a new foreign policy calling: renovating weak or failing states.  THE DECLINE OF A STRATEGIC NARRATIVE  The practical challenges of state-building missions are now widely appreciated. They tend to be long, difficult, and expensive, with success demanding an open-ended commitment to a messy, violent, and confusing endeavor -- something unlikely to be sustained in an era of budgetary austerity. But the last decade has driven home intellectual challenges to the concept as well.  The threat posed by weak and fragile states, for example, turned out to be both less urgent and more complex and diffuse than was originally suggested. Foreign Policy’s Failed States Index for 2013 is not exactly a roster of national security priorities; of its top 20 weak states, very few (Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan) boast geostrategic significance, and they do so mostly because of their connection to terrorism. But even the threat of terrorism isn’t highly correlated with the current roster of weak states; only one of the top 20, Sudan, appears on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, and most other weak states have only a marginal connection to terrorism at best.  A lack of definitional rigor posed a second problem. There has never been a coherent set of factors that define failed states: As the political scientist Charles Call argued in a powerful 2008 corrective, the concept resulted in the “agglomeration of diverse criteria” that worked to “throw a monolithic cloak over disparate problems that require tailored solutions.” This basic methodological flaw would distort state-building missions for years, as outside powers forced generic, universal solutions onto very distinct contexts.  The specified dangers were never unique to weak states, moreover, nor would state-building campaigns necessarily have mitigated them. Take terrorism. The most effective terrorists tend to be products of the middle class, often from nations such as Saudi Arabia, Germany, and the United Kingdom, not impoverished citizens of failed states. And terrorist groups operating in weak states can shift their bases of operations: if Afghanistan becomes too risky, they can uproot themselves and move to Somalia, Yemen, or even Europe. As a result, “stabilizing” three or four sources of extremist violence would not render the United States secure. The same could be said of threats such as organized crime, which finds comfortable homes in functioning but troubled states in Asia, eastern Europe, and Latin America.  As the scholar Stewart Patrick noted in a 2006 examination of the purported threats issuing from weak states, “What is striking is how little empirical evidence underpins these assertions and policy developments. Analysts and policymakers alike have simply presumed the existence of a blanket connection between state weakness and threats to the national security of developed countries and have begun to recommend and implement policy responses.”  And although interconnectedness and interdependence may create risks, the dangers in such a world are more likely to come from strong, well-governed states with imperfect regulations than weak ones with governance deficiencies. Financial volatility that can shake the foundations of leading nations and cyberattacks that could destabilize energy or information networks pose more immediate and persistent risks than, say, terrorism.",10094.0,"<h4>No Somalian spillover</h4><p><strong>Mazarr 14 </strong>[Michael J, Professor of National Security Strategy at the National War College, “The Rise and Fall of the Failed-State Paradigm,” Foreign Affairs, Jan/Feb, 93.1 113-121 http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/140347/michael-j-mazarr/the-rise-and-fall-of-the-failed-state-paradigm] </p><p>For a decade and a half, from the mid-1990s through about 2010, the dominant national security narrative in the United States stressed the dangers posed by weak or <u><mark>failing states</u></mark>.

It needs to be seen for what it is, a product of the split between the moderate and revolutionary socialist movement The record of the revolutionary tradition is a cruel and dogmatic denial of political rights","A second issue central to discussion of revolution today is that of the historic legacy of revolutions. Writers on revolution like to invoke Marx's observation about the weight of past generations lying on the minds of the present; it has been often stated that all revolutions invoke symbols and claims derived from the past, real or imagined. The revolutionaries of the twentieth century all looked, in some degree, backwards: Lenin and Trotsky to 1789, Mao and Ho to I9I7, Castro to the 1890s, Khomeini to the seventh century. The present discussion of revolution seems, at first sight, not to do this. Political sociologists do look at earlier revolutions, but this is without practical import. Discussion of the possibility of change, particularly that linked to the anti-globalization movement, seems to be curiously ahistorical. The price of this is, however, that not only is inspiration from the past muted but, equally, lessons are not learnt. Here something curious seems to have happened since the collapse of communism: the amnesia of neoliberal discussion, which consigns all that was associated with the communist experiment to the dustbin, seems to be replicated in the case of the radical movements of today. But to do this is questionable. In this latter respect, there are dangers, of an amnesia that is long on enthusiasm but short on responsibility and realism. For the fact is that the history of revolution in modern times is one not only of resistance, heroism and idealism, but also of terrible suffering and human disaster, of chaos and incompetence under the guise of revolutionary transformation, of the distortion of the finest ideals by corrupt and murderous leaders, and of the creation of societies that are far more oppressive and inefficient than those they seek to overthrow. The anti-globalization movement makes much of revolutionary internationalism: tills is not some benign panacea, but a complex, often abused, transnational practice (Halliday I999). All of this entails confronting something that revolutionaries have always assumed but too often failed to discuss: the ethics of revolution. Denunciation of the given and invocations of an ideal other are not enough (Geras 1989). To grasp this involves a shift beyond the political sociology of revolutions, an academic pursuit that focuses in large measure on the incidence of revolutions, to an analysis of the consequences and longer term records of revolutionary states. In the course of recent years, in writing my own work on revolutions, I have had reason to visit a number of cities that had served as the centers of world revolution and, if not revolution, anti-imperialist radicalism: Beijing, Havana, Tripoli, Tehran. These were the culminations of upheavals that had produced revolutionary regimes by some strange numerical consistency in, respectively, I949, I959, I969, I979· In every case, one could still discern the outlines of the original revolutionary project: a rejection of exploitation, foreign and domestic, a comnlitment to the transformation of society, internationalist support in rhetoric and deed for those resisting oppression elsewhere. But in the 1990S this had all faded: these were not the wave of the future. Whatever else, it could not be said that the initial revolutionary project was in good shape: few in these countries now believed in the ideological project that had initiated the revolution; corruption and inefficiency were widespread; there was a pervasive desire for change, towards a more open, liberal, society; the initial internationalist appeals had faded. Revolution had, in effect, become tired. It was indeed capitalism, not revolutionary socialism and third-worldism, which in the 1990S formed the global vision of the future. This haphazard and impressionistic response has, however, to be compounded by a reflection on the overall legacy of the century of revolutions: neither form of amnesia—counterrevolutionary or revolutionary—is acceptable. Indeed, amnesia invites the repetition of another common saying with regard to revolutions, that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Here perhaps is one of the most worrying aspects of the contemporary radical movement, be it in its national or internationalist forms: the failure to reflect, critically, on the past record of revolutionary movements. This pertains to models of alternative political and social orders. It pertains to the dangers inherent in any utopian, radicalized, mass movement that lacks clear forms of authority and decision-making. It also involves the espousal, spirited but onlinous, of alternative social orders that could work only if imposed by an authoritarian state. A pertinent contemporary example is that of radical environmentalism: the program of de-industrialization, and restricted consumption and travel, entailed by such ideas could only be established, and maintained, by a coercive state. In the international sphere, the simple invocation of solidarity may too often conceal interests of power, and manipulation. In the days of authoritarian Communist Parties, but equally in that of national and communal movements today, unconditional solidarity with repressive organizations may be at odds with any commitment to emancipatory values.
Such a critical reflection has to apply, too, to the individuals often invoked for contemporary purposes: Lenin was a visionary, but also a cruel, pompous bigot; Che was a man of heroism and solidarity, but his econonlic programs were a disaster and his austere romanticism at times led to cruelty; Mao freed a quarter of mankind from imperialism, but also repeatedly plunged his society into barbarous conflict and social experimentation; Khomeini overthrew the Shah, but his social and political program was reactionary and repressive. A similar pause in romanticization might be applicable to some of the supposed components of the anti-globalization front today: few might defend Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong-il or Ayatollah Khamenei, but there is perhaps too little questioning of the commitment to emancipatory values of the PKK in Turkey, Sendero Luminoso, the FARC in Colombia, the Chechen rebels, to name but some. The Zapatista movement has become for many an icon of hope: but, as contributors to this volume make clear, it is not always itself a model of democratic practice. More importantly, one has to ask if this is the most important experience in the Latin America of the I990S to study: it is part of, but only one part of, a broader crisis of the authoritarian PRI regime that beset Mexico and resulted in the rise on the one hand of the PRD and on the other of the election of Fox in 2000. An open assessment of challenges to authoritarian, and neoliberal, policies in Latin America in the I990S would also examine democratization in Brazil and Chile, and the experience of social movements, be they of women, workers or indigenous peoples, who engaged with reformist states. This need for a critical retrospective on the historical legacy of revolutions is, however, linked to another, perhaps even more pressing, issue, one that pervades the pages of this book, namely the relation of revolution to liberal democracy as a whole. Several contributors point out that where liberal democracy is established revolution is off the agenda. But this reflection may be taken further to ask the question of whether, faced with the alternative, one or other outcome is preferable. The implication of much 'revolutionary' writing over the past century has been that liberal democracy is to be denounced, and those who engage with and in it are reformists, dupes, or, in older language, 'class traitors'. Such a view lives on, in some of the contributions to this book, as in parts of the left. Yet this contrast of reform with revolution is not some eternal polarity. It too needs to be set in historical context, and seen for what it is, a product of the particular context of the twentieth century, starting with the split between the moderate and revolutionary factions of the socialist movement in 19I4. The costs of this division are evident enough, and it would be desirable, in the aftermath of the collapse of the revolutionary socialist models, to re-examine it (Therborn I989). Part of this re-examination would involve a questioning of the automatic antinomy of reform and revolution present in much contemporary and recent writing, and of the assumed contradictory relation of revolutionary ideas to those of another critical, and internationalist, trend produced by modernity: liberalism. This has immediate implications for the discussion in this book. In particular, it relates to an issue that is widely present in contemporary academic and political discussion, but that writers on revolution tend to avoid, namely the question of rights. The language of rights was long denounced by the left, and its revolutionary part, as a bourgeois myth, except where it was for tactical reasons deemed pertinent to use it, as with regard to workers' rights, or the right of nations to selfdetermination. The record of the revolutionary tradition, once it came to power, is a very mixed one: a strong commitment to certain social and economic rights, whose abolition by neoliberal policies many in the former Communist states regret; and a sustained, cruel and dogmatic denial of political rights, collective and individual. Yet the program of rights embodied in national, regional and international codes is, as much as any flamboyant radicalism, both a critique and a program that confronts the contemporary world. Faced with the record of the Communist tradition on rights on the one hand, and the aspirations of liberalism on the other, this disdain for rights, and the related adherence to a denunciation of reformism and liberalism, should be questioned. Invocations of a romanticized I968, of the nicer cases of armed struggle, or of Seattle may be fine for mobilization: they are not a serious answer to the problems of the contemporary world.",10055.0,"<h4>Revolutionary methodology generates atrocities.  History of 20th century revolutions proves we should choose liberal reformism. </h4><p>Fred <strong>HALLIDAY</strong> IR @ London School of Economics <strong>3</strong> [“Finding the Revolutionary in Revolution” in The Future of Revolutions ed. John Foran p 306-309]</p><p>A second issue central to discussion of revolution today is that of the historic legacy of revolutions. Writers on revolution like to invoke Marx's observation about the weight of past generations lying on the minds of the present; it has been often stated that all revolutions invoke symbols and claims derived from the past, real or imagined. The revolutionaries of the twentieth century all looked, in some degree, backwards: Lenin and Trotsky to 1789, Mao and Ho to I9I7, Castro to the 1890s, Khomeini to the seventh century. The present discussion of revolution seems, at first sight, not to do this. Political sociologists do look at earlier revolutions, but this is without practical import. Discussion of the possibility of change, particularly that linked to the anti-globalization movement, seems to be curiously ahistorical. The price of this is, however, that not only is inspiration from the past muted but, equally, lessons are not learnt. Here something curious seems to have happened since the collapse of communism: <u>the amnesia of neoliberal discussion</u>, which consigns all that was associated with the communist experiment to the dustbin, <u>seems to be replicated in</u> the case of the <u>radical movements of today</u>. But to do this is questionable. In this latter respect, <u>there are dangers, of an amnesia that is long on enthusiasm but short on responsibility and realism</u>. For the fact is that <u><mark>the history of revolution</mark> in modern times <mark>is</mark> </u>one not only of resistance, heroism and idealism, but <u>also <mark>of terrible suffering</mark> and <mark>human disaster</mark>,</u> of ch<u>aos <mark>and incompetence</mark> under the guise of revolutionary transformation</u>, of the distortion of the finest ideals by corrupt and murderous leaders, and of the creation of societies that are far more oppressive and inefficient than those they seek to overthrow. The anti-globalization movement makes much of <u>revolutionary internationalism: </u>tills <u>is</u> not some benign panacea, but a complex, <u>often abused,</u> transnational practice (Halliday I999). <u>All of this entails confronting</u> <u>something that revolutionaries</u> have <u>always assumed but too often failed to discuss: the ethics of revolution</u>. <u><mark>Denunciation of the given and invocations of an ideal</mark> other <mark>are not enough</u></mark> (Geras 1989). <u><mark>To grasp this involves a shift beyond</mark> the</u> political sociology of revolutions, <u><mark>an academic</mark> pursuit that <mark>focus</mark>es </u>in large measure <u><mark>on the incidence of revolutions</u>, <u>to an analysis of the consequences</mark> and longer term records <mark>of revolutionary states</u></mark>.

They might stumble or appear awkward, but the alternative -- to let the action grind to a halt -- is much worse. The audience waits, watching to see how and if the story will continue and at whose initiative. This is as true on the world stage as in the most remote regional theater.  This weekend I had the opportunity to sit with a group of well-known Egyptian actors and producers, the top filmmakers from a country in crisis. When they heard I was an American from Washington, they began to vent. ""How could Washington have turned their back on us?"" they asked. How could we have failed to see that the June revolution -- 30 million people coming together to stop a man who was destroying the country -- was, in the words of one actress, ""a miracle."" Why, she asked, had we failed to challenge the leader deposed in that revolution, Mohamed Morsy, while he was systematically undercutting the fragile democracy he was entrusted to help build? Why would we not call out the Muslim Brotherhood for its violence? For the threat it posed to the entire Middle East? ""We were your friends,"" the actress emoted. ""We loved you. Why did you turn away?"" ""You're asking the wrong questions,"" I said. ""I understand your frustration, but you can't afford to be so focused on the past. You can't afford to ask why America is doing what it is doing or not doing. If you want to recapture American support and the support of the world, you have to make a new story yourselves, create a more positive narrative that says that the June revolution was a turning point for the better."" Another guest at the dinner table, an American who is working with the Egyptian government to help it shape its message linked to these issues, jumped in and said, ""You have one thing you must focus on. In a matter of weeks, no more than a few months, you will have to produce the kind of result on the constitutional referendum that sends a clear message. Fifty-one percent in favor will not do. You need 70 or 75 percent support for the new constitution to have a clear mandate, for the new government to stand up to the opponents who will try to undermine it."" Others at the table nodded. They understood this central truth. Because for those with hopes for Egyptian democracy, there should not be two things on the agenda. There can only be one: Create meaningful, lasting change that proves that reforms are in the name of Egypt's people -- which in this case means producing a national constitution that is seen to be a genuine manifestation of the will of the Egyptian people. In a country where the only real organizations with the capacity to effectively organize nationwide action are the military and the Brotherhood, this challenge is greater still. And the political infrastructure that such a campaign requires just isn't in place to support it. So such a campaign must be built and energized with a kind of single-mindedness that, frankly, the interim government has yet to sufficiently motivate or mobilize. That said, however, there is something happening in Egypt today that is remarkable, and it's sending a signal not just to the volatile region that is home to that country, but to the world. America, on the grand stage, may have forgotten its lines and gone all deer-in-the-headlights at just the wrong moment, but others are stepping up and moving the story forward in positive ways. Even though the United States failed to be tough with Morsy when it could have and should have, the constructive heavy-lifting is being done by others. The Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and the Emiratis are working together to provide the current regime with resources. But they are not just throwing money at the problem, pumping cash into a central bank account. They are methodically selecting big visible projects that are creating jobs and helping the wounded economy in crucial areas like infrastructure investment. This sends a message to Egyptian voters that the new way may be better for them, producing a better future. Naturally, the Gulf states are not doing this for entirely charitable reasons. They view the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat. They clearly want to stop it. They are also writing checks to cover Egyptian military arms purchases for which the United States has halted funding. But international actors act in their self-interest. And, geopolitics, like physics or a play in which the lead actor forgets his lines, abhors a vacuum. So what is happening in Egypt, like what is happening elsewhere in the Middle East and around the world, is that once-secondary players are assuming  new roles -- roles that would have been hard to imagine either during the bipolar years of the Cold War or the brief unipolar moment that followed. In many places -- Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind -- what will fill the void left behind by the United States is likely to exacerbate the mess we helped create. But in other areas (and Egypt may be one of them), if a new constitution is actually produced, is seen as advancing the country toward democracy, and is then widely embraced, it will send the healthy message that regional solutions can work. Of course, America has not shuffled off the stage entirely. We have simply paused at an awkward moment. The world's sole superpower is not simply going to cease to play a role. But that role will inevitably, it seems, be somewhat smaller. We will be more circumspect in our actions, more reluctant to take risks. We have been strained by our own overreach internationally and by our mismanagement and political dysfunction at home, and we will move more slowly and take more limited actions. More often than before, we will stand by as others step up and find their own solutions. (All this, of course, as we and others continue to debate just how big the U.S. role should be, what risks we should take, and how we should lead.) Meanwhile, we will play a guiding or catalytic role where we can in select situations worldwide, no doubt frustrating many who are used to a stronger helping hand and letting someone else (us) do the heavy lifting. But even light-touch American intervention can still be useful, as hinted at this week with Secretary of State John Kerry's constructive brief visit to Egypt in which he noted that the interim government is making progress toward democracy. He did not make the recent U.S. error of overemphasizing the trappings of democracy -- which are often used as covers as they were by Morsy for intensely anti-democratic activities. Kerry focused as he (and we) should on democratic values and on the importance of continuing progress in their service. It was helpful and timely. As a consequence of these shifts, the world is going to have to get used to a new cast of featured players, many assuming more prominent roles than before in regional theaters of action. Indeed, recently, we have seen other examples of what this new world might look like. Whether they are homegrown trade initiatives like the Pacific Alliance in Latin America, or the German-Brazilian initiative in the U.N. to rein in surveillance abuses worldwide (though admittedly, the United States has had an inadvertently prominent role in that drama, wearing, unfortunately, a black hat), or the efforts among Asian countries to come up with a new regional architecture without much constructive involvement from the United States, or even the Russian initiative to address the chemical weapons issue in Syria, there are signs that a more subdued or hesitant America will leave open the door to new, more diverse collaborative processes for shaping the world of tomorrow. That is not to simply accept American retreat. As the richest and most powerful nation in the world, we have a vital role to play. Nor does noting the shift to a more pluralistic international system minimize the importance of the U.S. role when we do put our shoulder to the wheel as we have in Israel and Palestine, belatedly in Syria on chemical weapons, or with regard to sanctions against Iran. But even in those cases, the goal of the initiatives is -- let's be honest -- to produce outcomes in which the United States can be less active, less engaged. To some extent, what we are trying to do is make the world safe not for democracy, as Woodrow Wilson would have had it, but for American withdrawal. And frankly, given some of the mistakes we have made recently, it is hard not to wonder, unfamiliar and uncomfortable as it may be for everyone to accept, whether we might not sometimes get better outcomes from responsible leadership by actors other than the United States. That said, while the world will get along just fine if the United States sometimes takes a supporting role on the grand stage of global affairs, encouraging others to take the lead, there is a caveat. And that of course is that we don't screw things up in the role we do play. Again, the example of Egypt comes to mind. Leave it to our regional allies, virtually all of whom -- Arabs and Israelis alike -- support giving the current government a chance, to take matters into their own hands. But don't then start punishing that government in ways that we didn't and should have in the case of Morsy. As the great star of the global stage of the past century hesitates, pausing perhaps to reconsider its role, we cannot and should not expect the world to stop, nor can we or our friends around the world spend too much time lamenting the degree to which the present is not like the past or our own ideals of what a new new world order ought to look like. Problems need solving now.

They might stumble or appear awkward, but the alternative -- to let the action grind to a halt -- is much worse. The audience waits, watching to see how and if the story will continue and at whose initiative. <u><strong><mark>This is as true on the world stage as in the most remote regional theater.</u></strong></mark>  This weekend I had the opportunity to sit with a group of well-known Egyptian actors and producers, the top filmmakers from a country in crisis. When they heard I was an American from Washington, they began to vent. ""How could Washington have turned their back on us?"" they asked. How could we have failed to see that the June revolution -- 30 million people coming together to stop a man who was destroying the country -- was, in the words of one actress, ""a miracle."" <u><strong>Why, she asked, had we failed to challenge the leader deposed in that revolution, Mohamed Morsy, while he was systematically undercutting the fragile democracy he was entrusted to help build? </u></strong>Why would we not call out the Muslim Brotherhood for its violence? For the threat it posed to the entire Middle East? ""We were your friends,"" the actress emoted. ""We loved you. Why did you turn away?"" ""<u><strong>You're asking the wrong questions,"" I said. ""I understand your frustration, but you can't afford to be so focused on the past.</u></strong> You can't afford to ask why America is doing what it is doing or not doing. <u><strong>If you want to recapture American support and the support of the world, you have to make a new story yourselves</u></strong>, create a more positive narrative that says that the June revolution was a turning point for the better."" Another guest at the dinner table, an American who is working with the Egyptian government to help it shape its message linked to these issues, jumped in and said, ""You have one thing you must focus on. In a matter of weeks, no more than a few months, you will have to produce the kind of result on the constitutional referendum that sends a clear message. Fifty-one percent in favor will not do. You need 70 or 75 percent support for the new constitution to have a clear mandate, for the new government to stand up to the opponents who will try to undermine it."" Others at the table nodded. They understood this central truth. Because for those with hopes for Egyptian democracy, there should not be two things on the agenda. There can only be one: Create meaningful, lasting change that proves that reforms are in the name of Egypt's people -- which in this case means producing a national constitution that is seen to be a genuine manifestation of the will of the Egyptian people. In a country where the only real organizations with the capacity to effectively organize nationwide action are the military and the Brotherhood, this challenge is greater still. And the political infrastructure that such a campaign requires just isn't in place to support it. So such a campaign must be built and energized with a kind of single-mindedness that, frankly, the interim government has yet to sufficiently motivate or mobilize. That said, however, <u><strong>there is something happening in Egypt today that is remarkable, and it's sending a signal not just to the volatile region that is home to that country, but to the world</u></strong>. <u><strong><mark>America</u></strong></mark>, on the grand stage, <u><strong><mark>may</mark> <mark>have</mark> forgotten its lines and <mark>gone</mark> all <mark>deer-in-the-headlights</u></strong></mark> at just the wrong moment, <u><strong><mark>but others are stepping up</mark> and moving the story forward in positive ways</u></strong>. Even though the United States failed to be tough with Morsy when it could have and should have, <u><strong>the constructive heavy-lifting is being done by others. The Saudis, the Kuwaitis, and the Emiratis are working together to provide the current regime with resources</u></strong>. But they are not just throwing money at the problem, pumping cash into a central bank account. <u><strong>They are methodically selecting big visible projects that are creating jobs and helping the wounded economy in crucial areas like infrastructure investment.</u></strong> This sends a message to Egyptian voters that the new way may be better for them, producing a better future. Naturally, the Gulf states are not doing this for entirely charitable reasons. They view the Muslim Brotherhood as a threat. They clearly want to stop it. They are also writing checks to cover Egyptian military arms purchases for which the United States has halted funding. But international actors act in their self-interest. And, <u><strong>geopolitics</u></strong>, like physics or a play in which the lead actor forgets his lines, <u><strong>abhors a vacuum</u></strong>. So <u><strong>what is happening in Egypt, like what is happening elsewhere in the</u></strong> Middle East and around the <u><strong>world</u></strong>, <u><strong>is</u></strong> that <u><strong><mark>once-secondary players are assuming  new roles</u></strong></mark> -- roles that would have been hard to imagine either during the bipolar years of the Cold War or the brief unipolar moment that followed. <u><strong>In many places </u></strong>-- Iraq and Afghanistan come to mind -- <u><strong>what will fill the void left behind by the United States is likely to exacerbate the mess </u></strong>we helped create. <u><strong>But in other areas</u></strong> (and Egypt may be one of them), <u><strong><mark>if a new constitution is actually produced</mark>, is seen as advancing the country toward democracy, </u></strong>and is then widely embraced<u><strong>, <mark>it will send the</mark> healthy <mark>message</mark> that <mark>regional solutions can work</u></strong></mark>. Of course, America has not shuffled off the stage entirely. We have simply paused at an awkward moment. The world's sole superpower is not simply going to cease to play a role. But that role will inevitably, it seems, be somewhat smaller. <u><strong>We will be more circumspect in our actions, more reluctant to take risks<mark>. We have been strained by our</mark> own <mark>overreach</mark> internationally and by our mismanagement <mark>and political dysfunction at home</u></strong></mark>, and we will move more slowly and take more limited actions. More often than before, <u><strong>we will stand by as others step up and find their own solutions</u></strong>. (All this, of course, as we and others continue to debate just how big the U.S. role should be, what risks we should take, and how we should lead.) Meanwhile, <u><strong><mark>we will play a guiding or</mark> catalytic <mark>role where we can in select situations worldwide</mark>,</u></strong> no doubt frustrating many who are used to a stronger helping hand and letting someone else (us) do the heavy lifting. But <u><strong>even light-touch American intervention can still be useful,</u></strong> as hinted at this week with Secretary of State John Kerry's constructive brief visit to Egypt in which he noted that the interim government is making progress toward democracy. He did not make the recent U.S. error of overemphasizing the trappings of democracy -- which are often used as covers as they were by Morsy for intensely anti-democratic activities. Kerry focused as he (and we) should on democratic values and on the importance of continuing progress in their service. It was helpful and timely. As a consequence of these shifts, <u><strong><mark>the world is going to have to get used to a new cast of featured players,</mark> many assuming more prominent roles than before in regional theaters of action. I</u></strong>ndeed, recently, we have seen other examples of what this new world might look like. <u><strong><mark>Whether they</u></strong> <u><strong>are</u></strong></mark> homegrown trade initiatives like <u><strong><mark>the Pacific Alliance</u></strong></mark> in Latin America, <mark>or <u><strong>the German-Brazilian initiative</u></strong></mark> in the U.N. to rein in surveillance abuses worldwide (though admittedly, the United States has had an inadvertently prominent role in that drama, wearing, unfortunately, a black hat), <u><strong>or the efforts among <mark>Asian countries </mark>to come up with a new regional architecture without much constructive</u></strong> <u><strong>involvement from the United States, <mark>or even the Russian initiative </mark>to address the chemical weapons issue in Syria, <mark>there are signs</mark> that <mark>a</mark> more subdued or <mark>hesitant America will leave open the door to new</u></strong>,</mark> more diverse <u><strong><mark>collaborative processes</mark> for shaping the world of tomorrow.</u></strong> That is not to simply accept American retreat. As the richest and most powerful nation in the world, we have a vital role to play. Nor does noting the shift to a more pluralistic international system minimize the importance of the U.S. role when we do put our shoulder to the wheel as we have in Israel and Palestine, belatedly in Syria on chemical weapons, or with regard to sanctions against Iran. But even in those cases, <u><strong>the goal of the initiatives is</u></strong> -- let's be honest -- <u><strong>to produce outcomes in which the United States can be less active, less engaged. </u></strong>To some extent, what we are trying to do is make the world safe not for democracy, as Woodrow Wilson would have had it, but for American withdrawal. And frankly, given some of the mistakes we have made recently<u><strong>, it is hard not to wonder</u></strong>, unfamiliar and uncomfortable as it may be for everyone to accept, <u><strong>whether we might not sometimes get better outcomes from responsible leadership by actors other than the United States</u></strong>. That said, while the world will get along just fine if the United States sometimes takes a supporting role on the grand stage of global affairs, encouraging others to take the lead, there is a caveat. And that of course is that we don't screw things up in the role we do play. Again, the example of Egypt comes to mind. <u><strong><mark>Leave it to our regional allies</mark>, virtually all of whom</u></strong> -- Arabs and Israelis alike -- <u><strong>support giving the current government a chance, <mark>to take matters into their own hands</mark>.</u></strong> But don't then start punishing that government in ways that we didn't and should have in the case of Morsy. As the great star of the global stage of the past century hesitates, pausing perhaps to reconsider its role, <u><strong><mark>we</mark> cannot and <mark>should not expect the world to stop,</mark> <mark>nor</mark> can we or our friends around the world <mark>spend too much time lamenting the degree to which the present is not like the past</mark> or our own ideals of what a new new world order ought to look like.</u></strong> Problems need solving now. In the end, in places like Egypt, it is <u><strong>homegrown actors from that country and its neighbors who are going to have to continue to step into the limelight and shine and do it now, or <mark>we will have much darker outcomes to contemplate in the very near future</mark>.</p></u></strong>",,2NC,Heg,432568,1,17239,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/MaRe/Emory-Marcus-Reyes-Neg-Kentucky-Round8.docx,565531,N,Kentucky,8,Vanderbilt BM,Melanie Campbell,"1AC - Organ Sales - MSD and Disease Advantages

In light of all these difficulties, it is absolutely critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate the practice of medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene. Unfortunately, the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical practice in the highly promising area of stem-cell technology.
In the 2012 watershed decision Regenerative Sciences LLC v. United States, Judge Rosemary Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area. Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.
Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:
Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.
The FDA’s Power
Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases.",9912.0,"<h4>The plan’s Commerce Clause ruling <u>prevents FDA over-regulation</u> of stem cell research—that’s key to preserve the industry and medical innovation</h4><p>Richard A. <strong>EPSTEIN</strong>, James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, <strong>13</strong> [October 1, 2013, “Government Overreach Threatens Lives,” http://www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives]</p><p>Stem-cell treatment.</p><p>In light of all these difficulties, <u><mark>it is</u></mark> absolutely <u>critical</u> that <u><mark>the FDA</u></mark> should <u><mark>not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate</u></mark> the practice of <u><mark>medicine</mark>, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene</u>.

In light of all these difficulties, it is absolutely critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate the practice of medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene. Unfortunately, the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical practice in the highly promising area of stem-cell technology.
In the 2012 watershed decision Regenerative Sciences LLC v. United States, Judge Rosemary Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area. Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.
Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:
Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.
The FDA’s Power
Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in.

Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.
Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:
Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.
The FDA’s Power
Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases.",9912.0,"<h4>The plan’s Commerce Clause ruling <u>prevents FDA over-regulation</u> of stem cell research—that’s key to preserve the industry and medical innovation</h4><p>Richard A. <strong>EPSTEIN</strong>, James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, <strong>13</strong> [October 1, 2013, “Government Overreach Threatens Lives,” http://www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives]</p><p>Stem-cell treatment.</p><p>In light of all these difficulties, <u><strong><mark>it is</u></strong></mark> absolutely <u><strong>critical</u></strong> that <u><strong><mark>the FDA</u></strong></mark> should <u><strong><mark>not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate</u></strong></mark> the practice of <u><strong><mark>medicine</mark>, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene</u></strong>.

Now that <u>her decision is on appeal</u>, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”</p><p>It is widely recognized that <u><mark>stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances</mark> in connection with</u> such devastating <u>conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is</u> also <u>common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are</u> ultimately <u>transferred into</u> the body of <u>another, run the risk of immunological rejection</u> by the recipient. <u>The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under lab</u>oratory <u>conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function</u>.</p><p>Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.</p><p>Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:</p><p>Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.</p><p><u>A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot</u> hope to <u>recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharma</u>ceutical <u>companies</u>. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.</p><p>The FDA’s Power</p><p>Ms. <u>Malarkey’s letter <strong><mark>bases the FDA’s power on</strong></mark> the fact</u> that <u>the new <mark>technology affects <strong>“interstate commerce</mark>.”</u></strong> As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.</p><p>Judge <u>Collyer’s answer to that <mark>interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of</u></mark> Article I <u><mark>the Commerce Clause</u></mark>—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” <u><mark>That Clause received an <strong>indefensibly broad reading</strong> in</u></mark> the key New Deal decision <u><mark>Wickard</u></mark> v. Filburn, <u>where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of</u> national <u>economic activity—which is</u> surely <u>the case with</u> respect to <u>stem-cell research</u>.</p><p>Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”</p><p>These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.</p><p>The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.</p><p>Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.</p><p>Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.</p><p><u>Under the statute</u>, however, <u>it is not enough that some product used in</u> the course of this <u>stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease</u>. To be sure, <u>these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease</u>.</p><p>But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But <u>that point proves too much: by its logic, it would <strong>allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine</strong> so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do</u>.</p><p>In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, <u><mark>the FDA sought</u></mark>, at least for the moment, <u><mark>to limit the potential scope</mark> of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are</u>…<u>more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. <mark>But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any</u></mark> portion of the relevant <u><mark>statutory text.</mark> Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine</u>.</p><p>Bad Policy</p><p>In addition to being bad law, <u><mark>the FDA decision represents bad policy</mark>. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention</u>. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but <u>it would be a <strong><mark>serious setback to medical innovation</mark> if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet</u></strong>.</p><p>Surgery is half science and half art. The <u>procedures</u> that are used at any time <u>will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of</u> hunch, <u>experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The <mark>business would <strong>come to a screeching halt</strong></mark> if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur</u>.</p><p><u>And it is</u> all so <u>unnecessary</u>. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But <u>information</u> like that <u>is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix</u>.</p><p><u>A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand</u> in all cases <u>until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention</u>. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But <u>the courts are <strong>well within their power</strong> in striking down the FDA’s <strong>unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases</u></strong>.</p>",,1AC,1AC 2,432708,14,17267,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/SiKa/Emory-Sigalos-Karthikeyan-Aff-ADA-Round2.docx,565362,A,ADA,2,Vanderbilt BM,Andrew Hart,"1AC Commerce Clause Marijuana (Same as Texas Rnd 4)

marijuana is a more complicated political issue for young voters

Last week the Internet erupted in praise following reports that the FBI was reconsidering its hiring restrictions on marijuana use. FBI Director Comey said two days later, declaring at a Senate hearing, ""I am absolutely dead set against using marijuana The supposed potential change was a reaction to the agency's troubles recruiting hackers to fight cybercrime amid growing threats the FBI's policies state that applicants can't have used marijuana within the past three years many talented young hackers use marijuana marijuana users The cream of the crop is even more susceptible to disqualification a number of studies have found smart people are more likely to experiment with drugs A majority of Americans live in states where it's legal to use marijuana the federal government's unwillingness to update its approach to marijuana precludes countless otherwise law-abiding citizens from serving country in agencies like the FBI or CIA.

The survey found a growing sense of political apathy among adults under 30, driven by a lack of trust in political process and institutions.
And one issue that Democrats have hoped would drive youth turnout, marijuana legalization, might be more complicated than that.
Here’s a closer look at the poll’s three main takeaways:
1. Bad news for Democrats
Young people helped elect President Obama to office in 2008 and 2012. But this year, they’re not so eager to vote.
Just 23 percent of people ages 18 to 29 said they will definitely cast a ballot in the congressional elections in November. By comparison, 45 percent of voters under 30 showed up in 2012, with Obama winning six in ten.
Harvard’s midterm estimate has dropped 10 percentage points since last fall and it’s eight points lower than the poll’s numbers before the 2010 midterms, when Republicans won control of the House.
There’s a lot at stake this November, as Democrats are in danger of losing control of the Senate. In presidential election years, young people have become a key part of Obama’s winning coalition and given an edge to Democrats in Congress. But millennials traditionally stay home in midterm election years, and this one is no different.
In addition, the young voters who said they would show up come from traditionally Republican groups. Forty-four percent of those who said they voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 said they will definitely vote this year, compared to 35 percent who voted for Obama. Young men were nine points more likely to vote than women. Whites were also more likely to vote than African-Americans and Hispanics.
The one silver lining for Democrats? President Obama’s approval ratings have jumped six percentage points to 47 percent from a historic low of 41 percent last November.
2. A lack of trust
Young Americans were already cynical about the country’s political process and institutions. And the problem has only gotten worse in the last year.
Trust in the president has dipped from 39 percent to 32 percent, trust in the military went from 57 percent to 47 percent, and trust in the Supreme Court fell from 40 percent to 36 percent. The decline in trust was driven by changing attitudes among self-described Democrats and independents, according to Harvard.
The number of young people who say elected officials seem to be motivated by selfish reasons has jumped eight points since 2010 to 62 percent, another indicator that adults under 30 are losing faith in government. Twenty-nine percent say that political involvement rarely has any tangible results, up from 23 percent from four years ago.
3. Marijuana isn’t the key
Legalized marijuana is more popular than ever, leading some political consultants to believe that the issue could be used as a youth turnout mechanism.
But the Harvard poll paints a more mixed picture. Forty-four percent of those under 30 say they support legalizing marijuana, 23 percent strongly so. Thirty-four percent oppose it, and 22 percent are not sure. That’s much different from what the Pew Research Center found earlier this year, which is that 69 percent of adults ages 18 to 33 want pot to be legal.
Harvard found that millennials don’t think monolithically about weed. Almost half of young Democrats back legalized pot, but legalization also drew support from 32 percent of Republicans.
And the desire for legalization isn’t stronger among non-white millennials, who are often more likely to be arrested for marijuana. Forty-nine percent of whites back legalization, more than 10 points higher than blacks (38 percent) and Hispanics (37 percent).
All of this shows that marijuana is a more complicated political issue for young voters than what many in politics believe.
Legalization is key to cyber security recruitment – that boosts cyber deterrence
Tracy 14—Chairman of Students for Sensible Drug Policy [Sam, 5-24-14, “The FBI Isn't Updating Its Drug-Related Hiring Policies, But It Should Be,” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sam-tracy/the-fbi-isnt-updating-its_b_5394775.html?utm_hp_ref=tw]
Last week, the Internet erupted in praise, skepticism, and played-out puns following reports that the FBI was reconsidering its hiring restrictions on marijuana use. FBI Director James B. Comey said Monday that the agency was ""grappling with the question right now"" as the country changed its approach to marijuana, but backpedaled two days later, declaring at a Senate hearing, ""I am absolutely dead set against using marijuana... I did not say I'm going to change that ban."" It's a shame -- to stay as effective as possible, the FBI would do well to become more flexible on prospective employees' marijuana use. The supposed potential change was a reaction to the agency's troubles recruiting hackers to fight cybercrime amid growing threats from China and elsewhere. Comey, playing up stereotypes while stating a valid concern, went so far to say, ""I have to hire a great work force to compete with those cyber criminals and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview."" Meanwhile, the FBI's policies state that job applicants can't have used marijuana within the past three years, any other illegal drug in the past 10, or ever sold or transported any illegal drug. It is certainly true that many talented young hackers use marijuana. 14 percent of 18-29 year olds told the latest Gallup poll they were current marijuana users, and 36 percent reported trying it at some point in their lives -- and hackers are one of many subcultures well-known for their cannabis use. The cream of the crop is even more susceptible to disqualification: a number of studies have found smart people are more likely to experiment with drugs than their less-intelligent peers. But a policy change wouldn't just affect young hackers who use marijuana recreationally. The FBI employs over 35,000 people, from hackers to secretaries to spies to janitors. When a young hacker who enjoys marijuana is turned away from an FBI job for her past-time, she can probably find a better-paying, drug-test-free job at Google, Microsoft, or one of the countless startups hoping to be listed along with those giants one day. But a medical marijuana patient in one of the 21 states (and the nation's capital) where it's legal may not have as many options, and current FBI employees who could benefit from its use may turn to more risky treatment alternatives in order to keep their jobs. A majority of Americans live in states where it's legal to use marijuana for medical purposes, and millions of adults who live in (or vacation to) Colorado can already use it like they do alcohol or tobacco. Yet the federal government's unwillingness to update its approach to marijuana precludes countless otherwise law-abiding citizens from serving our country in agencies like the FBI or CIA. This already-nonsensical policy is all the more ridiculous when you consider our last three presidents -- each the ultimate head of the FBI -- has admitted to past illegal drug use. If having used cocaine doesn't disqualify one from being Commander in Chief, why should it take you out of the running to be an entry-level security analyst? The FBI could greatly expand its applicant pool, thus increasing the quality of its hires, if it simply threw out the rules barring past drug use and focused instead on preventing on-the-job impairment. They've already eased up on their restrictions before: no one who used marijuana more than 15 times could be hired before the FBI changed to its current policies in 2007. What drugs someone chooses to use has nothing to do with their trustworthiness or love of country, and we'd all do well to stop pretending it does.
Cyber attacks on the grid shuts down the military and causes nuclear war
Tilford 12—Graduate US Army Airborne School, Ft. Benning, Georgia [Robert, “Cyber attackers could shut down the electric grid for the entire east coast,” http://www.examiner.com/article/cyber-attackers-could-easily-shut-down-the-electric-grid-for-the-entire-east-coa]
***edited in brackets—we don’t agree with the ableist language
To make matters worse a cyber attack that can take out a civilian power grid, for example could also cripple [destroy] the U.S. military. The senator notes that is that the same power grids that supply cities and towns, stores and gas stations, cell towers and heart monitors also power “every military base in our country.” “Although bases would be prepared to weather a short power outage with backup diesel generators, within hours, not days, fuel supplies would run out”, he said. Which means military command and control centers could go dark. Radar systems that detect air threats to our country would shut Down completely. “Communication between commanders and their troops would also go silent. And many weapons systems would be left without either fuel or electric power”, said Senator Grassley. “So in a few short hours or days, the mightiest military in the world would be left scrambling to maintain base functions”, he said. We contacted the Pentagon and officials confirmed the threat of a cyber attack is something very real. Top national security officials—including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Director of the National Security Agency, the Secretary of Defense, and the CIA Director— have said, “preventing a cyber attack and improving the nation’s electric grids is among the most urgent priorities of our country” (source: Congressional Record).¶ So how serious is the Pentagon taking all this? Enough to start, or end a war over it, for sure. A cyber attack today against the US could very well be seen as an “Act of War” and could be met with a “full scale” US military response. That could include the use of “nuclear weapons”, if authorized by the President.",9922.0,"<h4>Weed won’t boost turnout – apathy & splits</h4><p><strong>FABIAN 14 political editor for Fusion, the cable and digital network from ABC News and Univision</strong> [Jordan Fabian, Young Voters Are Skipping Midterms and Marijuana Won’t Help, http://fusion.net/leadership/story/harvard-youth-poll-democrats-face-ugly-midterms-young-635862]</p><p>President <u>Obama and Democrats will have a tough time counting on young voters</u> in this November’s midterm elections, <u>a new poll says</u>.</p><p><u><mark>Young voters</mark> are increasingly <mark>unlikely to cast a ballot</u></mark> this fall, <u><mark>according to a poll from Harvard</mark> University’s Institute of Politics</u> released Tuesday. <u><mark>The survey found a growing sense of political apathy</mark> </u>among adults under 30, <u><strong><mark>driven by a lack of trust in political process</mark> and institutions</strong>.</p><p>And one issue that Democrats have hoped would drive youth turnout</u>, <u>marijuana</u> legalization, <u>might be more complicated than that.</p><p></u>Here’s a closer look at the poll’s three main takeaways:</p><p>1.

SouthCom has a history of being called on for disaster response in Latin America U.S. military will respond to a climate change disaster.”","HUARAZ, Peru — Glacier melt hasn’t caused a national crisis in Peru, yet. But high in the Andes, rising temperatures and changes in water supply have decimated crops, killed fish stocks and forced entire villages to question how they will survive for another generation.
U.S. officials are watching closely because without quick intervention, they say, the South American nation could become an unfortunate case study in how climate change can destabilize a strategically important region and, in turn, create conditions that pose a national security threat to Americans thousands of miles away.
“Think what it would be like if the Andes glaciers were gone and we had millions and millions of hungry and thirsty Southern neighbors,” said former CIA Director R. James Woolsey. “It would not be an easy thing to deal with.”
Glaciers in the South American Andes are melting faster than many scientists predicted, causing a dramatic change in the region’s availability of water for drinking, irrigation and electricity. Some climate change experts estimate entire glaciers will disappear in 10 years due to rising global temperatures, threatening to create instability across the globe long before their ultimate demise.
That’s particularly the case in Peru, where glacier melt has begun to deplete crops, displace communities, cause widespread drinking water shortages, destabilize hydroelectric power, diminish trade and affect transportation and tourism. The trend is expected to cause regional conflict, economic crises, increased crime, broken infrastructure and food insecurity.
Without substantial foreign assistance within the next five years, the disappearance of Peru’s glaciers could lead to a social and economic disaster, said Alberto Hart, climate change adviser at Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It’s also become a policy and funding challenge for the Obama administration, which must decide whether to send money, development assistance and possibly even military help south to an important democratic ally on a continent where Chinese and Iranian influence is growing, and anti-U.S. sentiment permeates certain regimes.
Other U.S. allies vulnerable to the impacts of climate change will be paying close attention to how the U.S. responds. Peru’s crisis could set a precedent for how the U.S. uses diplomacy, foreign aid and the military to address the climate change///
threats around the world.
“We may think that current wait-and-see policies are adequate to the task,” said Chad Briggs, Minerva Chair for Energy and Environmental Security with the U.S. Air Force. “Peru may be a looming example of how that is not the case.”
Senior U.S. diplomatic and military officials acknowledge the importance of helping Peru and other nations respond. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, State Department Climate Change Envoy Todd Stern and Western Hemisphere Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Arturo Valenzuela have made repeated trips to the region since early 2010 to discuss climate change and energy security.
Climate change is “a significant threat” to the region, and the U.S. must “really come to terms” with the security challenges it poses, Valenzuela said at a recent discussion with college students in Washington.
So far, Washington has responded with some assistance to Peru, primarily through development and anti-deforestation programs. Peruvian officials, though, have voiced frustration with what they contend is poor coordination among U.S. agencies, U.S. disregard for the importance of global cooperation and an agenda that fails to address the urgent need in Peru.
In a recent interview in Lima, one senior Peruvian official working on climate change issues said the U.S. has made it clear that climate change is not a priority in its negotiations with Peru.
It’s certainly a priority for Peru, which is the third most vulnerable country in the world to climate change risks, according to the U.K. Tyndall Centre on Climate Change, and will suffer the most immediate impacts of glacier melt. It also is struggling with rampant poverty, ethnic tensions, insurgency and continuing border disputes with Chile and Ecuador.
When added to existing security challenges, climate change could push the country into a national crisis, which is why some members of the U.S. intelligence community are worried.
“South America is of strategic importance, that’s pretty straightforward.” said one senior U.S. intelligence official. Climate change-induced water shortages in a country like Peru, which has limited coping mechanisms potentially are “destabilizing. And if that state is an important state to the United States, then it is a national security issue,” the official said.
‘There won’t be any more water’
Its ice is melting, but the majesty of Huascarán Mountain hasn’t diminished. Peru’s tallest mountain, its white peak still pierces the clouds on an overcast day in the Cordillera Blanca, part of the Andes range that stretches through Peru’s northwest department of Ancash.
Communities in the Cordillera Blanca still revere Huascarán for its beauty and the water it provides that allows them to survive in Peru’s extreme terrain, far from Lima and often beyond the reach of government services.
But over the last 20 years, they’ve watched Huascarán’s glacier start to disappear, the ice giving way to more black rock year after year.
“It used to take you two or three hours walking to reach the ice. But now you have to walk five, six hours to reach ice,” said Maximo Juan Malpaso Carranza, a farmer in Utupampa, a small community high in the Cordillera Blanca, as he installed a water pipe beneath the village’s dirt road to bring water from Huascarán to 105 houses.
“We all get water from there. That’s where the water source is,” he said, pointing to Huascarán. “But if the ice disappears, there won’t be any more water.”
Peru has lost 22 percent of its glaciers over the last 35 years, according to the Peruvian Ministry of Environment. Research by César Portocarrero, the Peruvian government’s lead glacier scientist, shows the Cordillera Blanca, which is home to one-quarter of the world’s tropical glaciers, has lost 30 percent of its glaciers since 1970. Parts of the Central Andes, the mountain range that supplies many of Peru’s coastal cities with water, have lost more 60 percent of their glaciers in the last 40 years.
“We know some glaciers could disappear in 20 years. We know this,” Portocarrero said.
The impact of glacier melt extends beyond the Andes. More than 2 million people, stretching from the Andes to the coastal cities, get their drinking water and irrigation from rivers fed by glacier runoff from Cordillera Blanca, according to Portocarrero’s studies. The secondary impacts of glacier melt will affect many more.
Life on Peru’s coast depends on water from the Andes. Most of its agriculture production is on the arid coast, fed by water from the Andes. Glacier-fed rivers also support the nation’s largest hydroelectric plants, which provide 60 percent of the country’s electricity.
Lima, the world’s second largest desert city, is almost totally dependent on Andean rivers fed by glacier melt. Water shortages are widespread there, and even worse in communities nearby that can’t compete with the capital for meager water supplies. Officials in Callao, a small port city next to Lima where 20 percent of the population is without water, fear further contamination of the dwindling supply will lead to outbreaks of dengue and cholera that could easily spread.
Rising conflicts, dwindling resources
Water conflicts have been frequent in southern Peru over the last few years, and many have turned fatal. Glacier melt will create more conflict over water resources that could affect the entire country, or, in extreme cases, conflicts with neighboring countries like Bolivia and Ecuador, countries with their own water problems, retired Maj. Gen. Luis Palomino Rodriguez, head of Peru’s National Civil Defense Institute, said in an interview.
Those water skirmishes have become a concern of U.S. officials. The 2007 Center for Naval Analyses report (pdf), a pivotal document that spearheaded high-level discussions about the security threat of climate change, says that Peru will “face a precarious situation” as the “loss of glaciers will strain water supply,” threatening the region stability. The National Intelligence Council warns (pdf) about social conflict over water as resources dwindle and demand for hydropower and crop irrigation rises.
The threat in the Andes has the Pentagon’s Southern Command more engaged in climate issues in the region, and Peru has emerged as a key partner. SouthCom and the State Department hosted a Climate Change and Regional Security Conference in Lima last June and plan to host a similar event next year for militaries from around the Western Hemisphere, said Myrna Lopez, an environmental security expert with SouthCom.
SouthCom started looking at the security impacts of climate change in 2008, but did not formalize its work on the issue until this year, when the 2010 Defense Department’s Quadrennial Defense Review (pdf) recognized climate change as a national security issue for the first time, according to Lopez.
SouthCom will release a new environmental security strategy in the coming months, but the military is far from integrating its climate change studies into operations.
“We have a lot to do,” Lopez said. “We’re not there yet where we have a complete buy-in from the DoD that this is a core military role.”
But, given its history, SouthCom probably won’t have a choice but to start planning for climate change. One of SouthCom’s primary missions is humanitarian aid and it has a history of being called on for disaster response in Latin America, according to the Air Force’s Briggs. “It will be the U.S. military that will respond to a climate change disaster.”",9904.0,"<h4>The Andes water crisis – US response will <u>set a precedent</u>.

749266,The plan’s Commerce Clause ruling prevents FDA over-regulation of stem cell research—that’s key to preserve the industry and medical innovation,EPSTEIN 13,"Richard A. EPSTEIN, James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, 13 [October 1, 2013, “Government Overreach Threatens Lives,” http://www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives]","it is critical the FDA not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical stem-cell technology
In the 2012 decision Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area her decision is on appeal
stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are transferred into another, run the risk of immunological rejection The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under lab conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharma companies
Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact the new technology affects “interstate commerce.”
Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of the Commerce Clause That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in Wickard where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of economic activity—which is the case with stem-cell research
Under the statute it is not enough that some product used in stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease
that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do
the FDA sought to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine
the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet
procedures will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur
And it is unnecessary information is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases","it is the FDA not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate medicine the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical stem-cell technology.

the FDA decision represents bad policy serious setback to medical innovation
business would come to a screeching halt","Stem-cell treatment.
In light of all these difficulties, it is absolutely critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate the practice of medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene. Unfortunately, the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical practice in the highly promising area of stem-cell technology.
In the 2012 watershed decision Regenerative Sciences LLC v. United States, Judge Rosemary Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area. Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.
Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:
Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.
The FDA’s Power
Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases.",9912.0,"<h4>The plan’s Commerce Clause ruling <u>prevents FDA over-regulation</u> of stem cell research—that’s key to preserve the industry and medical innovation</h4><p>Richard A. <strong>EPSTEIN</strong>, James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, <strong>13</strong> [October 1, 2013, “Government Overreach Threatens Lives,” http://www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives]</p><p>Stem-cell treatment.</p><p>In light of all these difficulties, <u><strong><mark>it is</u></strong></mark> absolutely <u><strong>critical</u></strong> that <u><strong><mark>the FDA</u></strong></mark> should <u><strong><mark>not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate</u></strong></mark> the practice of <u><strong><mark>medicine</mark>, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene</u></strong>.

It is</u> also <u>common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are</u> ultimately <u>transferred into</u> the body of <u>another, run the risk of immunological rejection</u> by the recipient. <u>The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under lab</u>oratory <u>conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function</u>.</p><p>Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.</p><p>Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:</p><p>Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.</p><p><u>A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot</u> hope to <u>recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharma</u>ceutical <u>companies</u>. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.</p><p>The FDA’s Power</p><p>Ms. <u>Malarkey’s letter <strong><mark>bases the FDA’s power on</strong></mark> the fact</u> that <u>the new <mark>technology affects <strong>“interstate commerce</mark>.”</u></strong> As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.</p><p>Judge <u>Collyer’s answer to that <mark>interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of</u></mark> Article I <u><mark>the Commerce Clause</u></mark>—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” <u><mark>That Clause received an <strong>indefensibly broad reading</strong> in</u></mark> the key New Deal decision <u><mark>Wickard</u></mark> v. Filburn, <u>where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of</u> national <u>economic activity—which is</u> surely <u>the case with</u> respect to <u>stem-cell research</u>.</p><p>Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”</p><p>These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.</p><p>The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.</p><p>Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.</p><p>Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.</p><p><u>Under the statute</u>, however, <u>it is not enough that some product used in</u> the course of this <u>stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease</u>. To be sure, <u>these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease</u>.</p><p>But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But <u>that point proves too much: by its logic, it would <strong>allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine</strong> so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do</u>.</p><p>In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, <u><mark>the FDA sought</u></mark>, at least for the moment, <u><mark>to limit the potential scope</mark> of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are</u>…<u>more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. <mark>But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any</u></mark> portion of the relevant <u><mark>statutory text.</mark> Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine</u>.</p><p>Bad Policy</p><p>In addition to being bad law, <u><mark>the FDA decision represents bad policy</mark>. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention</u>. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but <u>it would be a <strong><mark>serious setback to medical innovation</mark> if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet</u></strong>.</p><p>Surgery is half science and half art. The <u>procedures</u> that are used at any time <u>will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of</u> hunch, <u>experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The <mark>business would <strong>come to a screeching halt</strong></mark> if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur</u>.</p><p><u>And it is</u> all so <u>unnecessary</u>. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But <u>information</u> like that <u>is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix</u>.</p><p><u>A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand</u> in all cases <u>until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention</u>. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But <u>the courts are <strong>well within their power</strong> in striking down the FDA’s <strong>unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases</u></strong>.</p>",,1AC,1AC 2,432708,14,17304,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/SiKa/Emory-Sigalos-Karthikeyan-Aff-ADA-Semis.docx,565366,A,ADA,Semis,Kentucky GN,"David Cram Helwich, Shyam Shanker, Brian DeLong","1AC Commerce clause

the subject continues to run the theoretical show","To be sure, Baudrillard is aware that in our time the primitive is allowed to exist only as a simulacrum, a model constructed by the human sciences precisely to replace the vanished or vanishing original. Baudrillard argues that such a simulation of the primitive occurred in 1971 when the government of the Philippines, on the advice of anthropologists, ordered that a few dozen Tasaday, a newly 'discovered' and allegedly 'stone age' tribe, be cordoned off in their remote jungle home and protected from further media and ethnological contact and attention (Simulations 13).2 The ethnologists were worried that the Tasaday would lose their primitive innocence and thus lobbied that they be sealed off from further exposure to a decomposing modernity. But this seemingly generous and self-denying gesture on the part of the scientists constitutes, for Baudrillard, a self-serving justification of their own discipline, allowing them to render the Tasaday into 'simulacra Indians who proclaim at last the universal truth of ethnology' (16). Baudrillard's argument is worth quoting at length:
Science loses a precious capital, but the object will be safe - lost to science, but intact in its 'virginity.' It isn't a question of sacrifice (science never sacrifices itself: it is always murderous), but of the simulated sacrifice of its object in order to save its reality principle. The Tasaday frozen in their natural element, provide a perfect alibi, an eternal guarantee ... The Indian thereby driven back into the ghetto, into the glass coffin of virginforest, becomes the simulation model for all conceivable Indians before ethnology. The latter thus allows itself the luxury of being incarnate beyond itself, in the 'brute' reality of these Indians it has entirely reinvented Savages who are indebted to ethnology for still being Savages: what a turn of events, what a triumph for this science which seemed dedicated to their destruction! (Simulations 14-15)
Simulation can thus be seen as the strategy adopted by the ethnologist, or subject of investigation, not only to gain control and mastery over the primitive, or object of investigation, but also to dispense with the primitive/ object altogether. In the simulation model Baudrillard has sketched out, the Tasaday or primitive/ object, once cordoned off and controlled, can be entirely dispensed with, since it is only their theoretical or simulated presence that is required to prove ethnology's importance as a science of the primitive. But while this may appear to suggest that Baudrillard has deconstructed the concept of the primitive and shown it to be merely a discursive construct or simulation of Western theory, a closer examination of his work reveals that, far from abandoning the concept of the primitive, he sees it as crucial and necessary to his theoretical enterprise.
In fact what Baudrillard proposes is a simple binary reversal in which the power of the formerly privileged ethnologist or Western subject is questioned and replaced by the formerly disadvantaged primitive or non-Western object. What Baudrillard calls the principle of reversibility results in the fatal revenge of the object on the subject. As he describes it,
The Object and the world let themselves be surprised for an instant (a brief instant in the general cosmology) by the subject and science, but today they are violently reasserting themselves and taking revenge .... Such is the figure of our fatality, that of an objective turnaround, of an objective reversal of the world. (Ecstasy 87)
Though the object may appear passive, indifferent and inert as opposed to the subject's active will to power and knowledge, Baudrillard points out that the object's very indifference and passivity make it an 'insoluble enigma,' 'an obstacle to all understanding,' 'ever more ungraspable' and 'contemptuous of all attempts to manipulate it' (Transparency 172).
The object is thus uncooperative and resistant to the subject's attempt to control and master it. Consequently, Baudrillard tells us, Science has lost its interlocutor [the object], which, like the 'savage,'
appears not to have responded with genuine dialogue. It seems that it is not a good object, ... that it secretly evades all attempts at scientific evangelization (rational objectification), and that it is taking its revenge for having been 'understood' by surreptitiously undermining the foundations of the edifice of science. (Transparency 173)
Through an ironic reversal, the object, thought to be mastered by the subject, turns the tables on the latter. Baudrillard shows how such a reversal is fatal to our usual ways of thinking, which assume the centrality of the subject:
The main focus of interest has always been on the conditions in which the subject discovers the object, but those in which the object discovers the subject have not been explored at all. We flatter ourselves that we discover the object and conceive it as waiting there meekly to be discovered. But perhaps the cleverer party here is not the one we think. What if it were the object which discovered us in all this? This would give us not merely an uncertainty principle, which can be mastered by equations, but a principle of reversibility which is much more radical and more aggressive. (Similarly, didn't viruses discover us at least as much as we discovered them, with all the consequences that follow? And didn't the American Indians themselves discover us in the end?) (Perfect Crime 55)
According to Baudrillard's reversibility principle, the object, the virus, and the Indian have the last laugh over those who had thought to master them. Similarly, returning to Baudrillard's comments on the Tasaday, it turns out that the primitive ultimately escapes its role as ethnology's simulacrum, as the alibi and guarantee of Western science, by stubbornly refusing to come alive and thus validating its simulated role, choosing instead to remain inert and enigmatic like the dead. As Baudrillard remarks, at the very moment of its putative triumph, ethnology gives up its final and only lesson, the secret which kills it (and which the savages understood much better): the vengeance of the dead .... It is science which ostensibly masters the object, but it is the latter which deeply invests the former, following an unconscious reversion, giving only dead and circular replies to a dead and circular interrogation. (Simulations 17) The primitive is thus both an ostensibly tamed or simulated object and a vengeful or fatal one. The simulated primitive is a product of the assumption that, in the act of simulation, ethnology possesses complete control and knowledge of its object. Baudrillard's argument, however, is that the primitive as object can never be completely knowable and, as such, can never be fully simulated. Like the object that wreaks vengeance on the subject, the primitive exceeds and subverts the simulated model produced by ethnology.
In Baudrillard's thought, then, the primitive as simulation is deconstructed only to be replaced by the primitive as pure or authentic object. The primitive is a pure object, however, only if it is unknowable. As Baudrillard describes it, 'the Object is an insoluble enigma, because it is not itself and does not know itself. It resembles ... [a] savage, whom one could not understand for the same reason that he could not understand himself (Transparency 172). It is precisely because the object is unknowable that it is able to master the knowing subject. There are a couple of problems, however, with Baudrillard's account of the triumph of the uncognizable object.
First, the object's (or primitive's) victory is surely pyrrhic; because it cannot know itself, it cannot know about its overcoming of the subject. The primitive as pure object may defeat ethnology's attempts to understand and manipulate it, but it has neither conscious agency nor comprehension of either its plight or its triumph.
Second, the pure primitive or object, described as being unlike the subject in that it is unknowing and unknowable, seems nonetheless to exhibit subject-like intentions, motives, and emotions such as vengeance, cunning, sly servility, and 'the passion of indifference' (Ecstasy 93; emphasis mine). Supposed to be unknowable, the object appears amenable to all kinds of descriptions and imputations. Perhaps the object is not as purely objective as Baudrillard thinks it to be, and we may thus entertain the suspicion that the object may well be the most subtle theoretical trick yet employed by the subject, the most realistic simulation currently available and one that would offer an avant-garde edge to a theorist in the highly competitive Parisian academic scene. Douglas Kellner, for example, has described Baudrillard in such terms, calling him a double agent who, while championing the object, is really in fact speaking for the subject:
[A] lthough Baudrillard wants to present himself as the voice and advocate of the object, he is really a double agent, secretly representing the subject as he anthropomorphizes the object world in an amazing creative display that out-Disneys Disney. For it is clear that, ultimately, he is projecting the categories of subjectivity, as well as his own subjective imagination, into the domain of objects (ascribing to them as objective features his subjective projections such as revenge, indifference and so on), thus secretly continuing in a different form the very philosophy of subjectivity that he pretends to combat. (180-1)
In the end, then, despite Baudrillard's valorization of the object, it is the subject that continues to run the theoretical show. Baudrillard's theory of the fatal object turns out to be a covert theory of the subject's fetishistic approach to the object in the same way that his critique of ethnology's simulation of the primitive merely reintroduces the primitive as a pure object simulated by the theorist's own subjective imagination.",9964.0,"<h4>Hyperreality and reversibility aren’t excuses for abandoning empirical accounts.

It needs to be seen for what it is, a product of the split between the moderate and revolutionary socialist movement The record of the revolutionary tradition is a cruel and dogmatic denial of political rights","A second issue central to discussion of revolution today is that of the historic legacy of revolutions. Writers on revolution like to invoke Marx's observation about the weight of past generations lying on the minds of the present; it has been often stated that all revolutions invoke symbols and claims derived from the past, real or imagined. The revolutionaries of the twentieth century all looked, in some degree, backwards: Lenin and Trotsky to 1789, Mao and Ho to I9I7, Castro to the 1890s, Khomeini to the seventh century. The present discussion of revolution seems, at first sight, not to do this. Political sociologists do look at earlier revolutions, but this is without practical import. Discussion of the possibility of change, particularly that linked to the anti-globalization movement, seems to be curiously ahistorical. The price of this is, however, that not only is inspiration from the past muted but, equally, lessons are not learnt. Here something curious seems to have happened since the collapse of communism: the amnesia of neoliberal discussion, which consigns all that was associated with the communist experiment to the dustbin, seems to be replicated in the case of the radical movements of today. But to do this is questionable. In this latter respect, there are dangers, of an amnesia that is long on enthusiasm but short on responsibility and realism. For the fact is that the history of revolution in modern times is one not only of resistance, heroism and idealism, but also of terrible suffering and human disaster, of chaos and incompetence under the guise of revolutionary transformation, of the distortion of the finest ideals by corrupt and murderous leaders, and of the creation of societies that are far more oppressive and inefficient than those they seek to overthrow. The anti-globalization movement makes much of revolutionary internationalism: tills is not some benign panacea, but a complex, often abused, transnational practice (Halliday I999). All of this entails confronting something that revolutionaries have always assumed but too often failed to discuss: the ethics of revolution. Denunciation of the given and invocations of an ideal other are not enough (Geras 1989). To grasp this involves a shift beyond the political sociology of revolutions, an academic pursuit that focuses in large measure on the incidence of revolutions, to an analysis of the consequences and longer term records of revolutionary states. In the course of recent years, in writing my own work on revolutions, I have had reason to visit a number of cities that had served as the centers of world revolution and, if not revolution, anti-imperialist radicalism: Beijing, Havana, Tripoli, Tehran. These were the culminations of upheavals that had produced revolutionary regimes by some strange numerical consistency in, respectively, I949, I959, I969, I979· In every case, one could still discern the outlines of the original revolutionary project: a rejection of exploitation, foreign and domestic, a comnlitment to the transformation of society, internationalist support in rhetoric and deed for those resisting oppression elsewhere. But in the 1990S this had all faded: these were not the wave of the future. Whatever else, it could not be said that the initial revolutionary project was in good shape: few in these countries now believed in the ideological project that had initiated the revolution; corruption and inefficiency were widespread; there was a pervasive desire for change, towards a more open, liberal, society; the initial internationalist appeals had faded. Revolution had, in effect, become tired. It was indeed capitalism, not revolutionary socialism and third-worldism, which in the 1990S formed the global vision of the future. This haphazard and impressionistic response has, however, to be compounded by a reflection on the overall legacy of the century of revolutions: neither form of amnesia—counterrevolutionary or revolutionary—is acceptable. Indeed, amnesia invites the repetition of another common saying with regard to revolutions, that those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it. Here perhaps is one of the most worrying aspects of the contemporary radical movement, be it in its national or internationalist forms: the failure to reflect, critically, on the past record of revolutionary movements. This pertains to models of alternative political and social orders. It pertains to the dangers inherent in any utopian, radicalized, mass movement that lacks clear forms of authority and decision-making. It also involves the espousal, spirited but onlinous, of alternative social orders that could work only if imposed by an authoritarian state. A pertinent contemporary example is that of radical environmentalism: the program of de-industrialization, and restricted consumption and travel, entailed by such ideas could only be established, and maintained, by a coercive state. In the international sphere, the simple invocation of solidarity may too often conceal interests of power, and manipulation. In the days of authoritarian Communist Parties, but equally in that of national and communal movements today, unconditional solidarity with repressive organizations may be at odds with any commitment to emancipatory values. Such a critical reflection has to apply, too, to the individuals often invoked for contemporary purposes: Lenin was a visionary, but also a cruel, pompous bigot; Che was a man of heroism and solidarity, but his econonlic programs were a disaster and his austere romanticism at times led to cruelty; Mao freed a quarter of mankind from imperialism, but also repeatedly plunged his society into barbarous conflict and social experimentation; Khomeini overthrew the Shah, but his social and political program was reactionary and repressive. A similar pause in romanticization might be applicable to some of the supposed components of the anti-globalization front today: few might defend Saddam Hussein, Kim Jong-il or Ayatollah Khamenei, but there is perhaps too little questioning of the commitment to emancipatory values of the PKK in Turkey, Sendero Luminoso, the FARC in Colombia, the Chechen rebels, to name but some. The Zapatista movement has become for many an icon of hope: but, as contributors to this volume make clear, it is not always itself a model of democratic practice. More importantly, one has to ask if this is the most important experience in the Latin America of the I990S to study: it is part of, but only one part of, a broader crisis of the authoritarian PRI regime that beset Mexico and resulted in the rise on the one hand of the PRD and on the other of the election of Fox in 2000. An open assessment of challenges to authoritarian, and neoliberal, policies in Latin America in the I990S would also examine democratization in Brazil and Chile, and the experience of social movements, be they of women, workers or indigenous peoples, who engaged with reformist states. This need for a critical retrospective on the historical legacy of revolutions is, however, linked to another, perhaps even more pressing, issue, one that pervades the pages of this book, namely the relation of revolution to liberal democracy as a whole. Several contributors point out that where liberal democracy is established revolution is off the agenda. But this reflection may be taken further to ask the question of whether, faced with the alternative, one or other outcome is preferable. The implication of much 'revolutionary' writing over the past century has been that liberal democracy is to be denounced, and those who engage with and in it are reformists, dupes, or, in older language, 'class traitors'. Such a view lives on, in some of the contributions to this book, as in parts of the left. Yet this contrast of reform with revolution is not some eternal polarity. It too needs to be set in historical context, and seen for what it is, a product of the particular context of the twentieth century, starting with the split between the moderate and revolutionary factions of the socialist movement in 19I4. The costs of this division are evident enough, and it would be desirable, in the aftermath of the collapse of the revolutionary socialist models, to re-examine it (Therborn I989). Part of this re-examination would involve a questioning of the automatic antinomy of reform and revolution present in much contemporary and recent writing, and of the assumed contradictory relation of revolutionary ideas to those of another critical, and internationalist, trend produced by modernity: liberalism. This has immediate implications for the discussion in this book. In particular, it relates to an issue that is widely present in contemporary academic and political discussion, but that writers on revolution tend to avoid, namely the question of rights. The language of rights was long denounced by the left, and its revolutionary part, as a bourgeois myth, except where it was for tactical reasons deemed pertinent to use it, as with regard to workers' rights, or the right of nations to selfdetermination. The record of the revolutionary tradition, once it came to power, is a very mixed one: a strong commitment to certain social and economic rights, whose abolition by neoliberal policies many in the former Communist states regret; and a sustained, cruel and dogmatic denial of political rights, collective and individual. Yet the program of rights embodied in national, regional and international codes is, as much as any flamboyant radicalism, both a critique and a program that confronts the contemporary world. Faced with the record of the Communist tradition on rights on the one hand, and the aspirations of liberalism on the other, this disdain for rights, and the related adherence to a denunciation of reformism and liberalism, should be questioned. Invocations of a romanticized I968, of the nicer cases of armed struggle, or of Seattle may be fine for mobilization: they are not a serious answer to the problems of the contemporary world.",10055.0,"<h4>History of 20th century revolutions proves we should choose liberal reformism over sacrificial methods</h4><p>Fred <u><strong>HALLIDAY</u></strong> IR @ London School of Economics <u><strong>3</u></strong> [“Finding the Revolutionary in Revolution” in The Future of Revolutions ed.

crimes of violence against women are disaggregated into separate acts of violence, with specific, defining features. Violence is pervasive in all the places where they live their lives The continuum also makes clear the relationship between the law's assessment of women's rights to legal redress and societal and legal attitudes about prostitution Feminists frequently criticize the manner in which the legal establishment and society scrutinize the conduct and motivations of a woman who is subjected to domestic abuse har assment, or rape more than they scrutinize the perpetrator when de termining whether the nature and severity of the harm warrants legal intervention When a woman engages in prostitution no questions need be asked. Both society and the law simply presume that the woman provoked, welcomed, and consented to the conduct, given what she was wearing, where she went, and the fact that she received money the inquiry is framed by assumptions made about a woman in prostitution.
These assumptions, which result in women who are engaged in prostitution having little or no protection under the law establish a paradigm for a certain type of conduct society and the law measure whether, when violence against women occurs, it is appropriate for civil or criminal law to intervene. The real purpose of questions like ""Why didn't she leave her partner?""; ?"", is to ascer tain whether the woman obtained a benefit, especially an economic one The unstated assumption is that if a woman enjoyed a benefit, she ""assumed the risk"" Here, prostitution serves as the paradigm for what constitutes an undeserving claim of harm. What we had comfortably assumed to be an inquiry into the elements of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, or rape turns out to be an inquiry into how closely a woman's behavior resembles prostitution. n37
the landmark Court case telegraphed an unavoidable outcome: If in deed you dress and behave like a woman engaged in prostitution, then the sexual advances will be deemed welcome and the claim of sexual harassment will fail.
The California Supreme Court in People v. Berry reversed the murder conviction of the defendant who had strangled his wife. the court found that the victim's ""long course of provocatory conduct"" entitled the defendant to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter the court focused on the victim's behavior By characterizing the wife's conduct as sexually provocative, the court depicted her as immoral/bad and therefore less worthy of protection The court's reasoning is clear: A woman who  behaves like a prostitute and is less worthy of the law's protection
prostitution's influence on the legal and social tra dition and its paradigmatic role as the standard by which the seriousness of charges of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and rape is evaluated, it is bound to these other forms of violence in yet a third way. Survivors of domestic abuse report that their batterers use the epithets of ""whore"" and ""slut"" when beating their victims They also report being forced to look at pornography
sexual harassers fre quently equate their victims to women in prostitution. It is not un common to find that the conduct alleged to constitute workplace sexual harassment involves references to prostitution through porno graphic images. n55 In Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, n56 for exam ple, the male shipyard workers targeted Lois Robinson by choosing pornographic images that included women who resembled her. n57 Like the batterers, the harassers in the shipyard sent the message that Robinson deserved no respect because she was the woman in the por nography - ""a whore."" n58
In recognizing that the neat, legal categories of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, rape, and prostitution do not accurately reflect how women experience acts of violence, we do not intend to obscure the fact that each category of violence presents issues particular to it. Our purpose is to expose that the prostitution paradigm, plays a role that is common in all categories of violence along the continuum the continuum reveals both the pervasiveness of violence and the pervasiveness of prostitution as a paradigm in women's lives legal reforms and changing societal views of one form of violence affect the law's treatment and society's understanding of the other forms of violence legal reforms that expand protection from violence have the potential to blur the boundaries between each and prostitution law reform efforts also have the capacity to transform our legal and societal understanding of prostitution.","When a woman engages in prostitution society and the law presume the woman consented to the conduct, given the fact she received money

[*1230]  Traditionally, crimes of violence against women are disaggregated into separate acts of violence, with specific, defining features. In con trast, the notion of a continuum of violence reflects women's lived experiences: Violence is pervasive in all the places where they live their lives - in their homes, their workplaces, and in public spaces. The continuum also makes clear the relationship between the law's assessment of women's rights to legal redress and societal and legal attitudes about prostitution. Feminists frequently criticize the manner in which the legal establishment and society scrutinize the conduct and motivations of a woman who is subjected to domestic abuse, har assment, or rape more than they scrutinize the perpetrator when de termining whether the nature and severity of the harm the woman has suffered warrants legal intervention. n31 In situations of domestic abuse, a woman is typically asked whether she provoked the violence and why she remained in the relationship. n32 In cases of sexual harass ment in the workplace, the questions pertain to whether the woman welcomed the conduct and why she remained in that employment. n33 In rape, the critical inquiry is whether the woman consented. This entails subsidiary questions about why she was where she was, wear ing what she was wearing, and behaving the way she was behaving. n34  [*1231]  When a woman engages in prostitution, however, no questions need be asked. Both society and the law simply presume that the woman provoked, welcomed, and consented to the conduct, given what she was wearing, where she went, and the fact that she received money. n35 Where the circumstances involve prostitution, the failure to ask these questions does not mean that the woman is not the focus of the in quiry. It just means that the inquiry is framed by assumptions made about a woman in prostitution.
These assumptions, which result in women who are engaged in prostitution having little or no protection under the law, n36 establish a paradigm for a certain type of conduct. It is against this paradigm that society and the law measure whether, when violence against women occurs, it is appropriate for civil or criminal law to intervene. The real purpose of questions like ""Why didn't she leave her partner?""; ""Why didn't she leave that job?""; ""Why was she with that man?"", is to ascer tain whether the woman obtained a benefit, especially an economic one. The unstated assumption is that if a woman enjoyed a benefit, she ""assumed the risk"" and therefore bears responsibility for the vio lence, leaving the alleged perpetrator less accountable for his behav ior. Here, prostitution serves as the paradigm for what constitutes an undeserving claim of harm. What we had comfortably assumed to be an inquiry into the elements of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, or rape turns out to be an inquiry into how closely a woman's behavior resembles prostitution. n37
[*1232]  For example, in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, n38 the landmark United States Supreme Court case that recognized ""hostile environment"" sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII, the Court held that testimony about the complainant's sexu ally provocative speech or dress was not per se inadmissible to estab lish the element of unwelcomeness to the sexual advances. n39 The Court found that ""such evidence is obviously relevant."" n40 In so doing, the Court constructed its inquiry into the element of unwelcomeness as an inquiry into how closely the complainant's dress and behavior resembled the stereotypical dress and behavior of a woman in prosti tution. The Court thus telegraphed an unavoidable outcome: If in deed you dress and behave like a woman engaged in prostitution, then the sexual advances will be deemed welcome and the claim of sexual harassment will fail.
The California Supreme Court in People v. Berry n41 reversed the murder conviction of the defendant who had strangled his wife. The opinion dwells on the victim's behavior in what the court described as ""a tormenting two weeks in which Rachel alternately taunted defen dant... and at the same time sexually excited defendant."" n42 There was uncontroverted evidence that prior to the defendant's murder of his wife by strangulation, he had choked her twice, at least once to the point of unconsciousness. n43 The facts set out by the court also indicate that during this time the defendant's wife was in the process of leaving the defendant and had informed the defendant that she wanted a di vorce. n44 Nevertheless, the court found that the victim's ""long course  [*1233]  of provocatory conduct"" entitled the defendant to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. n45 Here the court focused on the victim's behavior, not the defendant's. It emphasized her relationship with an other man and that she had, in the court's view, used that relationship to ""taunt"" the defendant. n46 This focus permitted the court to base the degree of the husband's culpability on the moral/good or immoral/bad behavior of the wife. By characterizing the wife's conduct as sexually provocative, the court depicted her as immoral/bad and therefore less worthy of protection. n47 The stereotype behind this construction is that of the prostitute who, by her very nature, engages in sexually provoca tive behavior. The court's reasoning is clear: A woman who engages in sexually provocative conduct behaves like a prostitute and is less worthy of the law's protection. Further, the actions that she provokes by her behavior are, at least in part, deserved.
In addition to prostitution's influence on the legal and social tra dition of focusing on the behavior of women and its paradigmatic role as the standard by which the seriousness of charges of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and rape is evaluated, it is bound to these other forms of violence in yet a third way. Women report acts of violence that are embedded in the images of prostitution, which are often rein forced through pornography. Survivors of domestic abuse report that their batterers use the epithets of ""whore"" and ""slut"" when beating their victims. n48 They also report being forced to look at pornography  [*1234]  and sometimes being forced to replicate the acts portrayed. n49 Survi vors also report that attackers use similar epithets during rapes and sometimes throw money at them afterwards. n50
State v. Norman, n51 a 1989 North Carolina Supreme Court case, demonstrates how sometimes domestic abuse can take the form of prostitution. In an unsuccessful appeal of her conviction for voluntary manslaughter of her husband, Judy Norman argued that she was enti tled to have the jury consider whether the killing was done in self- defense. n52 She presented evidence to show that she fit the profile of a  [*1235]  battered spouse to support her self-defense claim, which included tes timony that the deceased frequently assaulted her, struck her with var ious objects, and put out cigarettes on her body. n53 There was also testimony that her husband did not work and forced her to make money by prosti tution, and that he made humor of that fact to family and friends. He would beat her if she resisted going out to prostitute herself or if he was unsatisfied with the amounts of money she made. He rou tinely called the defendant ""dog,"" ""bitch,"" and ""whore,"" and on a few occasions made her eat pet food out of the pets' bowls and bark like a dog. n54
As in domestic violence and rape cases, sexual harassers fre quently equate their victims to women in prostitution. It is not un common to find that the conduct alleged to constitute workplace sexual harassment involves references to prostitution through porno graphic images. n55 In Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, n56 for exam ple, the male shipyard workers targeted Lois Robinson by choosing pornographic images that included women who resembled her. n57 Like the batterers, the harassers in the shipyard sent the message that Robinson deserved no respect because she was the woman in the por nography - ""a whore."" n58

This entails subsidiary questions about why she was where she was, wear ing what she was wearing, and behaving the way she was behaving. n34  [*1231]  <u><strong><mark>When a woman engages in prostitution</u></strong></mark>, however, <u><strong>no questions need be asked. Both <mark>society and the law</mark> simply <mark>presume</mark> that <mark>the woman</mark> provoked, welcomed, and <mark>consented to the conduct, given</mark> what she was wearing, where she went, and <mark>the fact</mark> that <mark>she received money</u></strong></mark>. n35 Where the circumstances involve prostitution, the failure to ask these questions does not mean that the woman is not the focus of the in quiry. It just means that <u><strong>the inquiry is framed by assumptions made about a woman in prostitution.</p><p><mark>These assumptions, which result in women</mark> who are <mark>engaged in prostitution having</mark> little or <mark>no protection under the law</u></strong></mark>, n36 <u><strong><mark>establish a paradigm for</mark> a certain type of conduct</u></strong>. It is against this paradigm that <u><strong>society and the law measure whether, <mark>when violence against women occurs</mark>, it is appropriate for civil or criminal law to intervene.</u></strong> <u><strong>The real purpose of questions like ""Why didn't she leave her partner?"";</u></strong> ""Why didn't she leave that job?""; ""Why was she with that man<u><strong>?"", is to ascer tain whether the woman obtained a benefit, especially an economic one</u></strong>. <u><strong><mark>The</mark> unstated <mark>assumption is</mark> that <mark>if a woman enjoyed a benefit, she ""assumed the risk""</mark> </u></strong>and therefore bears responsibility for the vio lence, leaving the alleged perpetrator less accountable for his behav ior. <u><strong>Here, prostitution serves as the paradigm for what constitutes an undeserving claim of harm</u></strong>. What we had comfortably assumed to be an inquiry into the elements of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, or rape turns out to be an inquiry into how closely a woman's behavior resembles prostitution. <u><strong>n37</p><p></u></strong> [*1232]  For example, in Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, n38 <u><strong>the landmark</u></strong> United States Supreme <u><strong>Court case</u></strong> that recognized ""hostile environment"" sexual harassment as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII, the Court held that testimony about the complainant's sexu ally provocative speech or dress was not per se inadmissible to estab lish the element of unwelcomeness to the sexual advances. n39 The Court found that ""such evidence is obviously relevant."" n40 In so doing, the Court constructed its inquiry into the element of unwelcomeness as an inquiry into how closely the complainant's dress and behavior resembled the stereotypical dress and behavior of a woman in prosti tution. The Court thus <u><strong>telegraphed an unavoidable outcome: If in deed you dress and behave like a woman engaged in prostitution, then the sexual advances will be deemed welcome and the claim of sexual harassment will fail.</p><p>The California Supreme Court in People v. Berry</u></strong> n41 <u><strong>reversed the murder conviction of the defendant who had strangled his wife.</u></strong> The opinion dwells on the victim's behavior in what the court described as ""a tormenting two weeks in which Rachel alternately taunted defen dant... and at the same time sexually excited defendant."" n42 There was uncontroverted evidence that prior to the defendant's murder of his wife by strangulation, he had choked her twice, at least once to the point of unconsciousness. n43 The facts set out by the court also indicate that during this time the defendant's wife was in the process of leaving the defendant and had informed the defendant that she wanted a di vorce. n44 Nevertheless, <u><strong>the court found that the victim's ""long course</u></strong>  [*1233]  <u><strong>of provocatory conduct"" entitled the defendant to a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter</u></strong>. n45 Here <u><strong><mark>the court focused on the victim's behavior</u></strong></mark>, not the defendant's. It emphasized her relationship with an other man and that she had, in the court's view, used that relationship to ""taunt"" the defendant. n46 This focus permitted the court to base the degree of the husband's culpability on the moral/good or immoral/bad behavior of the wife. <u><strong>By characterizing the wife's conduct as sexually provocative, the court depicted her as immoral/bad and therefore less worthy of protection</u></strong>. n47 The stereotype behind this construction is that of the prostitute who, by her very nature, engages in sexually provoca tive behavior. <u><strong>The court's reasoning is clear: <mark>A woman who</mark> </u></strong>engages in sexually provocative conduct<u><strong> <mark>behaves like a prostitute</mark> and <mark>is less worthy of the law's protection</u></strong></mark>. Further, the actions that she provokes by her behavior are, at least in part, deserved.</p><p>In addition to <u><strong>prostitution's influence on the legal and social tra dition</u></strong> of focusing on the behavior of women <u><strong>and its paradigmatic role as the standard by which the seriousness of charges of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and rape is evaluated, it is bound to these other forms of violence in yet a third way.</u></strong> Women report acts of violence that are embedded in the images of prostitution, which are often rein forced through pornography. <u><strong><mark>Survivors of domestic abuse report</mark> that their <mark>batterers use</mark> the <mark>epithets of ""whore"" and ""slut"" when beating their victims</u></strong></mark>. n48 <u><strong>They also report being forced to look at pornography</u></strong>  [*1234]  and sometimes being forced to replicate the acts portrayed. n49 Survi vors also report that attackers use similar epithets during rapes and sometimes throw money at them afterwards. n50</p><p>State v. Norman, n51 a 1989 North Carolina Supreme Court case, demonstrates how sometimes domestic abuse can take the form of prostitution. In an unsuccessful appeal of her conviction for voluntary manslaughter of her husband, Judy Norman argued that she was enti tled to have the jury consider whether the killing was done in self- defense. n52 She presented evidence to show that she fit the profile of a  [*1235]  battered spouse to support her self-defense claim, which included tes timony that the deceased frequently assaulted her, struck her with var ious objects, and put out cigarettes on her body. n53 There was also testimony that her husband did not work and forced her to make money by prosti tution, and that he made humor of that fact to family and friends. He would beat her if she resisted going out to prostitute herself or if he was unsatisfied with the amounts of money she made. He rou tinely called the defendant ""dog,"" ""bitch,"" and ""whore,"" and on a few occasions made her eat pet food out of the pets' bowls and bark like a dog. n54</p><p>As in domestic violence and rape cases, <u><strong>sexual harassers fre quently equate their victims to women in prostitution</u></strong>. It is not un common to find that the conduct alleged to constitute workplace sexual harassment involves references to prostitution through porno graphic images. n55 In Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, n56 for exam ple, the male shipyard workers targeted Lois Robinson by choosing pornographic images that included women who resembled her. n57<u><strong> Like the batterers, the harassers in the shipyard sent the message that Robinson deserved no respect because she was the woman in the por nography - ""a whore."" n58</p><p>In recognizing that the neat, legal categories of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, rape, and prostitution do not accurately reflect </u></strong> [*1236]  <u><strong>how women experience acts of violence, we do not intend to obscure the fact that each category of violence presents issues particular to it.</u></strong> <u><strong>Our purpose</u></strong>, instead, <u><strong>is to expose that <mark>the prostitution paradigm</mark>,</u></strong> its images and its threats, <u><strong><mark>plays a role</mark> that is common <mark>in all categories of violence along the continuum</u></strong></mark>. In turn, <u><strong><mark>the continuum reveals</mark> both <mark>the pervasiveness of violence and</mark> the pervasiveness of <mark>prostitution as a paradigm in women's lives</u></strong></mark>. Because different categories of violence interrelate with and support each other, <u><strong><mark>legal reforms and changing societal views of one form of violence affect the law's treatment and society's understanding of the other forms of violence</u></strong></mark>. For this rea son, <u><strong>legal reforms that expand protection from violence</u></strong> in the areas of domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and rape <u><strong>have the potential to blur the boundaries between each </u></strong>of these forms of violence <u><strong>and prostitution</u></strong>. n59 In response, law reformers have developed strategies that seek to reinforce traditional distinctions or to construct new ones. Notwithstanding those strategies, however, <u><strong>law reform efforts also have the capacity to transform our legal and societal understanding of prostitution.</p></u></strong>",,1AC,1AC—Violence,431909,4,17332,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/SiKa/Emory-Sigalos-Karthikeyan-Aff-NDT-Round5.docx,565369,A,NDT,5,Michigan AP,"Andrea Reed, Andrew Hart, David Strauss","1AC Sex work prostitution

Given the failure to optimize designations in the human body, what remedies exist or should exist for these injured parties? Few court cases provide guidance on these issues and those that shape this field or answer the question offer reason for concern. Cryolife, Inc. v. Superior Court 33 and Condos v. Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation34 offer relevant, but troubling guidance. Importantly, each case relied on fuzzy signaling to arrive at conclusions that undermine the goals of optimizing designations for human body parts. In both cases courts ruled that human biologics sold for transplantation do not constitute products or goods, but rather services, thereby disadvantaging duped patients by restricting if not completely foreclosing all potential civil remedies. The Condos and Cryolife rulings conclude that tissue banks should not be held liable for placing contaminated tissues into the stream of commerce even if their products cause the deaths or life-threatening illnesses to consumers.
Courts appear wary to do the heavy lifting and shaping of new law, despite the Center for Disease Control’s (CDC’s) investigations revealing numerous problems at tissue bank laboratories and warehouses, and the very direct links between deaths and illnesses of consumers and cadaver sources used by the companies that process and sell body parts that they purchased. In other words, recent jurisprudence unwisely places the burden on patients and doctors to guard against implanting contaminated body parts.35 With this type of fuzzy guidance from courts, how are patients, often the least informed, to police this process?
Despite prior lawsuit settlements against Cryolife, the Court of Appeals of California determined in 2003 that Cryolife and arguably other tissue banks are immune from product liability when the body parts they place into the stream of commerce injure patients. 36 According to the Court of [END PAGE 195] Appeals of California, Cryolife’s immunity arises from the fact that buying, collecting, processing, storing, and selling body parts are collectively and essentially a “service” and that the parts sold are not “goods.”37 The Cryolife holding invites scrutiny as to the normative ordering of human body parts. For example, how should body parts be classified and what ought their legal statuses be?
The court’s conclusion that body parts are a service rather than facilitate the performance of a service precluded the plaintiff’s recovery and is a striking feature of the case. 38 On the one hand, few people would consider his or her knee, heart, hip, or spine a service – these are tangible, biological parts. On the other hand, tissue banks refuse to designate knees, bones, and other biologics as goods, which could potentially expose their shareholders to liability if contaminated cadaver tissues reach the stream of commerce. This tension and incoherence in the law expose the need for optimized designations and understanding of the legal and social status of body parts and tissues. In the changing function and use of body parts, common understandings as to bioparts’ postharvesting classification should also evolve. In other words, what Cryolife processes describes its service; what it produces through that processing is a good or product for which it receives value.
The relevance of this point proved significant to the court’s analysis of Cryolife and whether the plaintiff could pursue a strict liability claim for punitive damages against the tissue bank. Ultimately, the Court of Appeals of California was not persuaded by the plaintiff’s claim that Cryolife did not fit within the legislative exemption provided for blood banks.39 California and a majority of states enacted blood shield immunity statutes during the 1950s and throughout the subsequent two decades to shield organizations that collected and processed blood from strict liability claims.40
Indeed, Cryolife’s contention that the Health and Safety Code provisions of California, which define the status of tissue banks, barred plaintiffs from strict liability claims against tissue banks proved successful. 41 The statute, [END PAGE 196] however, does not explicitly provide such an exemption or immunity to tissue banks. Rather, Section 1606, the codification of the blood shield law, provides in pertinent part:
The procurement, processing, distribution, or use of whole blood, plasma, blood products, and blood derivatives for the purpose of injecting or transfusing the same, or any of them, into the human body shall be construed to be, and is declared to be, for all purposes whatsoever, the rendition of a service by each and every person, firm, or corporation participating therein.42
Ultimately, the court agreed with Cryolife’s nuanced definition of its business. The tissue bank claimed that its business status, although forprofit, is similar to that of blood banks – which traditionally operate as charitable, not-for-profit organizations – within the definition of the blood shield immunity law.43 Both sections of the law (1606 and 1635.2) describe the banks as providing services; however, only the blood shield statute provides an immunity provision – and only for blood banks.44 Despite the “difference in language of section 1606 and section 1635.2,”45 the court held that the legislature must have intended to shield tissue banks from strict liability claims.
The court’s novel interpretation of lawmakers’ legislative intent is not supported by any legislative history or legislative comment; nor does the court point to comment sections from the Health and Safety Code. Substantively, the court’s holding reasons that in 1991, the legislature should have known or predicted that in 2003 “tissue banks [would be] paid for their activities in connection with providing human cadaver tissue for medical use” and thus must have “intended tissue banks to be immune from strict liability.”46
However, the court’s effort to be guided by the legislature is undermined by its jurisprudence. To explicate, the court extends immunity protection to tissue banks when the statute that it relies upon does not grant that type of protection to the industry. The court gives a new and unusual interpretation of the tissue bank statute, which does not provide any immunity language, without an effort to investigate or explain whether the legislature actually [END PAGE 197] intended for tissue banks to be immune from strict liability lawsuits. It is more common to look at the legislative history, or at least to examine the record of the legislative committee enacting the statute, when a case is under de novo review. Had the court examined the legislative history of the blood bank statute and the later tissue bank regulations, it might have discovered that the public policy rationales for blood bank immunity were quite unique to that industry.47
Unlike blood suppliers, tissue banks operate under different business, tax, and social models. For example, some tissue banks supply heart valves, while others focus on cosmetic services, such as products to enhance lips, penis size, cheekbones, and other nonessential elective medical products. Moreover, the technology is available for highly sophisticated testing of tissues before they enter the stream of commerce, unlike the developing science of blood testing in the 1950s (when immunity statutes were first drafted).
The Cryolife ruling creates a problematic precedent, which undermines patient recovery and constrains the advancement of tort law jurisprudence in the biotech realm. The court too easily dismissed the plaintiff’s claim that he received a defective product and not a service. Minvielle’s surgeon successfully implanted a contaminated body part. The service received was perfectly fine. The product was the problem. The court made a significant error in expanding the protection of blood shield statutes (promulgated more than forty years prior) 48 to an industry neither so altruistic, nor anticipated by state legislatures in the 1950s and 1960s. Ironically, the court concludes its dismissal of the plaintiff’s strict liability claim against the tissue [END PAGE 198] bank by quoting from an earlier blood shield law case, Hyland Therapeutics v. Superior Court, 49 to support its rationale that the California legislature intended for blood banks to be free from fault:
We concur in the perception that “legislatures have determined that the production and use of human blood and its derivatives for therapeutic purposes should be encouraged; and for this purpose those who provide these products, and who are themselves free from fault, should not be required to bear the economic loss which might otherwise be imposed under the rules of strict liability which are applicable to sellers of commercial products generally.”50
The ruling indicates that the status and designation of the body can change from one handler to the next, perpetuating a problematic public policy. The courts recognized ownership or property interests in the transplanted body parts. However, the relevant question is, Who is the possessor or owner of body parts in the stream of commerce? One way to interpret these transactions that seems fairly consistent with the holding is that the patient owned the tendon he purchased. The tissue banks “owned” the tissues prior to selling them.

In light of all these difficulties, it is absolutely critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate the practice of medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene. Unfortunately, the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical practice in the highly promising area of stem-cell technology.
In the 2012 watershed decision Regenerative Sciences LLC v. United States, Judge Rosemary Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area. Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.
Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:
Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.
The FDA’s Power
Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases.",9912.0,"<h4>The plan’s Commerce Clause ruling <u>prevents FDA over-regulation</u> of stem cell research—that’s key to preserve the industry and medical innovation</h4><p>Richard A. <strong>EPSTEIN</strong>, James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, <strong>13</strong> [October 1, 2013, “Government Overreach Threatens Lives,” http://www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives]</p><p>Stem-cell treatment.</p><p>In light of all these difficulties, <u><mark>it is</u></mark> absolutely <u>critical</u> that <u><mark>the FDA</u></mark> should <u><mark>not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate</u></mark> the practice of <u><mark>medicine</mark>, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene</u>.

Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases.",9912.0,"<h4>The plan’s Commerce Clause ruling <u>prevents FDA over-regulation</u> of stem cell research—that’s key to preserve the industry and medical innovation</h4><p>Richard A. <strong>EPSTEIN</strong>, James Parker Hall Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Law and Senior Lecturer at the University of Chicago Law School, <strong>13</strong> [October 1, 2013, “Government Overreach Threatens Lives,” http://www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives]</p><p>Stem-cell treatment.</p><p>In light of all these difficulties, <u><strong><mark>it is</u></strong></mark> absolutely <u><strong>critical</u></strong> that <u><strong><mark>the FDA</u></strong></mark> should <u><strong><mark>not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate</u></strong></mark> the practice of <u><strong><mark>medicine</mark>, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene</u></strong>.

In light of all these difficulties, it is absolutely critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate the practice of medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene. Unfortunately, the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical practice in the highly promising area of stem-cell technology.
In the 2012 watershed decision Regenerative Sciences LLC v. United States, Judge Rosemary Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area. Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.

In light of all these difficulties, it is absolutely critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power over new drugs and devices to regulate the practice of medicine, where it is singularly ill-equipped to intervene. Unfortunately, the FDA has sought with some success to insert itself into the regulation of medical practice in the highly promising area of stem-cell technology.
In the 2012 watershed decision Regenerative Sciences LLC v. United States, Judge Rosemary Collyer sustained the FDA’s asserted control of this entire area. Now that her decision is on appeal, I have attacked her opinion at length in my essay for the Manhattan Institute, “The FDA’s Misguided Regulation of Stem-Cell Procedures: How Administrative Overreach Blocks Medical Innovation.”
It is widely recognized that stem-cell therapies hold the key to the next generation of medical advances in connection with such devastating conditions such as leukemia and Parkinson’s diseases. It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.
Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.
Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:
Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.
A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.
The FDA’s Power
Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.
Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.
Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”
These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.
The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.
Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.
Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.
Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.
But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.
In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.
Bad Policy
In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.
Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.
And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.
A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in.

751667,No one will follow—they can’t solve the legitimacy or capacity deficit,Buzan 10,"Buzan 10—Professor of International Relations @ London School of Economics [Barry Buzan (Senior Fellow @ IDEAS, Honorary professor @ Universities of Copenhagen and Fellow of the British Academy), “The End of Leadership?—Constraints on the World Role of Obama’s America,” IDEAS reports—special reports, 2010","there are now three powerful constraints that will largely block a return to US leadership The first is that the US has lost much of its followership The second is that the capacity of the US to lead is now much weakened The third is that there is a general turn against global leadership
There is some hope that under Obama differences over policy might improve the environment, but even on that issue Obama will be lucky just to get the US seen as not part of the problem. Domestic constraints on carbon pricing and accepting binding international standards will make it difficult for the US to lead Many other areas of disagreement remain deep That China is still plausibly able to criticise the US on environment issues is a marker of how far Washington’s reputation has fallen
In addition to having less common ground with its followers the US also has less capacity, both material and ideological, to play the role of leader US now operates in a world in which the distribution of power is becoming more diffuse The economic crisis not only hamstrung the US in terms of material capability, but also stripped away the Washington consensus as the ideological legitimizer for US leadership

It is appealing to think of the Obama administration as a return to normalcy after the deviance, unilateralist arrogance and damaging mistakes of the Bush years. In this view, we should expect a¶ return to business as usual, with the US picking up the signature themes of multilateralism and the¶ market that have underpinned its world role since the end of the Second World War. Although by no means universally loved, the US was an effective leader through the Cold War and beyond not only¶ because it promoted liberal economic and political values that were attractive to many others, but also¶ because it was prepared to bind its own power in multilateral rules and institutions sufficiently that¶ its followers could contain their fear of its overwhelming power. Does Obama’s liberal stance mean that we should expect a return to the leadership role that the US has exercised for more than half a¶ century? I argue that this is unlikely to happen because there are now three powerful constraints that¶ will largely block a return to US leadership. The first is that the US has lost much of its followership. The second is that the capacity of the US to lead is now much weakened even if it still retains the will¶ to do so. The third is that there is a general turn within international society against hegemony and¶ therefore against the global leadership role itself.
LOST FOLLOWERSHIP
If the US remains willing to lead, will anyone follow? There are two issues here: the growing range of policy disagreements on specific issues between the US and others; and the decline of shared values and visions between the US and its former followers. A good symbol of the weakening relationship¶ between the US and its followers is the replacement of talk about ‘friends and allies’ or ‘the free¶ world’ with a much harsher and still basically unchanged, line about ‘coalitions of the willing’. There¶ is some hope that under Obama differences over policy might improve in specific areas, particularly¶ the environment, but even on that issue Obama will be lucky just to get the US seen as not part of¶ the problem. Domestic constraints on carbon pricing and accepting binding international standards¶ will make it difficult for the US to lead. Many other areas of disagreement remain, some deep. The US has failed to make the war on terrorism into¶ anything like the binding cause that underpinned¶ its leadership during the Cold War, and its policies¶ continue to erode its liberal credentials. By its use¶ of torture, and even moreso the public advocacy¶ of such interrogation techniques by senior Bush administration figures, and by its rejection of the¶ Geneva Conventions on prisoners or war, it exposed¶ itself to ridicule and contempt as an advocate for¶ human rights. That China is still plausibly able to criticise the US on human rights and environment¶ issues is a marker of how far Washington’s reputation has fallen. US policy in the Middle East, particularly¶ on Israel, has few followers, and the repercussions of¶ the disastrous interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan¶ continue to rattle on. Unless China turns quite nasty, the inclination of many in the US to see China¶ as a challenger to its unipolar position is unlikely¶ to attract much sympathy. The financial chaos of 2008-9 has undermined Washington’s credibility as¶ an economic leader.
Anti-Americanism, though obviously not newbecame exceptionally strong under Bush, and is now more culturally based, and more corrosive of shared identities. It questions whether the ‘American way of life’ is an appropriate model for the rest of the world, and whether the US economic model is either sustainable or desirable. It looks at health; at a seeming US inclination to use force as the first choice policy instrument, with its domestic parallel of gun culture; at the influence of religion and special interest lobbies in US domestic politics; at a US government which was openly comfortable with the use of torture and was re-elected; and at a federal environmental policy until recently in denial about global warming; and asks not just whether the US is a questionable model, but whether it has become a serious part of the problem. While some of this was specific to the Bush administration, and is being turned around by Obama, some of the deeper issues are more structural. The US is much more culturally conservative, religious, individualistic, and anti-state than most other parts of the West. America’s religion and cultural conservatism and anti-statism set it apart from most of Europe, where disappointment with Obama is already palpable. America’s individualism and anti-statism set it apart from Asia, where China is anyway disinclined to be a follower. This kind of anti-Americanism rests on very real differences, and raises the possibility that the idea of ‘the West’ was just a passing epiphenomenon of the Cold War. The Bush administration asset-stripped half-a-century of respect for, goodwill towards and trust in US leadership, and it reflected, and helped to consolidate, a shift in the centre of gravity of US politics. The Obama administration cannot just go back to the late 1990s and pick up from where Clinton left off.
LOST CAPACITY
In addition to having less common ground with its¶ followers the US also has less capacity, both material and ideological, to play the role of leader. The rise¶ of China, and also India, Brazil and others, means¶ that the US now operates in a world in which the¶ distribution of power is becoming more diffuse, and in which several centres of power are not closely linked to it, and some are opposed. In this context, the Bush legacy of a crashed economy and an enormous debt severely constrain the leadership¶ options of the Obama administration. The economic¶ crisis of 2008-9 not only hamstrung the US in terms of material capability, but also stripped away the Washington consensus as the ideological legitimizer for US leadership. The collapse of neoliberal ideology¶ might yet be seen as an ideational event on the same¶ scale as the collapse of communism in 1989.
Since the late 1990s, and very sharply since 2003,¶ the US has in many ways become the enemy of its own 20th century project and thus of its own¶ capacity to lead. Not surprisingly this has deepened¶ a longstanding disjuncture between how the US¶ perceives itself and how the rest of the world sees it. The deeply established tendency of the US to see itself as an intrinsic force for good because it stands for a right set of universal values, makes it unable easily, or possibly at all, to address the disjuncture between its self-perception and how others see it. Self-righteous unilateralism does not acquire legitimacy¶ abroad. To the extent that celebrations of US power as a good in itself (because the US is good) dominate¶ American domestic politics, this does not inspire the US to seek grounds for legitimating its position abroad. A contributing factor here is the US tendency to demand nearly absolute security for itself. The problem for the US of transcending its own self-image is hardly new, but it has become both more difficult and more important in managing its position in the more complex world in which the US is neither so clearly on the right side of a great struggle, nor so dominant in material terms. It is unclear at this point whether Obama will be able to transcend this aspect of American politics, though it is clear that the nature of American¶ politics makes it difficult for any president to do so.
THE TURN AGAINST HEGEMONY
The third constraint stems not from any particular characteristic of the US, but from the fact of unipolarity itself. Since decolonisation global international society has developed a growing disjuncture between a¶ defining principle of legitimacy based on sovereign equality, and a practice that is substantially rooted in¶ the hegemony of great powers. The problem is the absence of a consensual principle of hegemony with¶ which international society might bridge this gap between its principles and its practices. A concentration¶ of power in one actor disrupts the ideas of balance and equilibrium which are the traditional sources and¶ conditions for legitimacy in international society. This problem would arise for any unipolar power, but it¶ connects back to the more US-specific aspects of the legitimacy deficit. Under the Bush administration, the US lost sight of what Adam Watson calls raison de systeme (‘the belief that it pays to make the system¶ work’), and this exacerbated the illegitimacy of hegemony in itself. Since the US looks unlikely to abandon its attachment to its own hegemony, this problem is not going to go away.
If hegemony itself is illegitimate, and the US now lacks both the capabilities and attractiveness to overcome this, what lies on the near horizon is a world with no global leader. Such a world would still have several great powers influential within and beyond their regions: the EU, Russia, China, Japan, the US, possibly¶ India and Brazil. It would also have many substantial regional powers such as South Africa, Turkey and Iran. Whether one sees a move towards a more polycentric, pluralist, and probably regionalised, world political order as desirable or worrying is a matter of choice. In such a world, global hegemony by any one power or culture will be unacceptable. Obama may hasten or delay the US exit from leadership. But the waning of the Western tide, and the re-emergence of a more multi-centred (in terms of power and wealth) and more multicultural (albeit with substantial elements of Westernization) world, mean that hegemonic global leadership whether by a single power or the West collectively is no longer going to be acceptable. The question is whether such a new world order can find the foundations for collective great power management,¶ and whether the US can learn to live in a more pluralist international society where it is no longer the sole¶ superpower but merely the first among equals.

But high in the Andes, rising temperatures and changes in water supply have decimated crops, killed fish stocks and forced entire villages to question how they will survive for another generation.
U.S. officials are watching closely because without quick intervention, they say, the South American nation could become an unfortunate case study in how climate change can destabilize a strategically important region and, in turn, create conditions that pose a national security threat to Americans thousands of miles away.
“Think what it would be like if the Andes glaciers were gone and we had millions and millions of hungry and thirsty Southern neighbors,” said former CIA Director R. James Woolsey. “It would not be an easy thing to deal with.”
Glaciers in the South American Andes are melting faster than many scientists predicted, causing a dramatic change in the region’s availability of water for drinking, irrigation and electricity. Some climate change experts estimate entire glaciers will disappear in 10 years due to rising global temperatures, threatening to create instability across the globe long before their ultimate demise.
That’s particularly the case in Peru, where glacier melt has begun to deplete crops, displace communities, cause widespread drinking water shortages, destabilize hydroelectric power, diminish trade and affect transportation and tourism. The trend is expected to cause regional conflict, economic crises, increased crime, broken infrastructure and food insecurity.
Without substantial foreign assistance within the next five years, the disappearance of Peru’s glaciers could lead to a social and economic disaster, said Alberto Hart, climate change adviser at Peru’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It’s also become a policy and funding challenge for the Obama administration, which must decide whether to send money, development assistance and possibly even military help south to an important democratic ally on a continent where Chinese and Iranian influence is growing, and anti-U.S. sentiment permeates certain regimes.
Other U.S. allies vulnerable to the impacts of climate change will be paying close attention to how the U.S. responds. Peru’s crisis could set a precedent for how the U.S. uses diplomacy, foreign aid and the military to address the climate change threats around the world.
“We may think that current wait-and-see policies are adequate to the task,” said Chad Briggs, Minerva Chair for Energy and Environmental Security with the U.S. Air Force. “Peru may be a looming example of how that is not the case.”
Senior U.S. diplomatic and military officials acknowledge the importance of helping Peru and other nations respond. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, State Department Climate Change Envoy Todd Stern and Western Hemisphere Assistant Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Arturo Valenzuela have made repeated trips to the region since early 2010 to discuss climate change and energy security.
Climate change is “a significant threat” to the region, and the U.S. must “really come to terms” with the security challenges it poses, Valenzuela said at a recent discussion with college students in Washington.
So far, Washington has responded with some assistance to Peru, primarily through development and anti-deforestation programs. Peruvian officials, though, have voiced frustration with what they contend is poor coordination among U.S. agencies, U.S. disregard for the importance of global cooperation and an agenda that fails to address the urgent need in Peru.
In a recent interview in Lima, one senior Peruvian official working on climate change issues said the U.S. has made it clear that climate change is not a priority in its negotiations with Peru.
It’s certainly a priority for Peru, which is the third most vulnerable country in the world to climate change risks, according to the U.K. Tyndall Centre on Climate Change, and will suffer the most immediate impacts of glacier melt. It also is struggling with rampant poverty, ethnic tensions, insurgency and continuing border disputes with Chile and Ecuador.
When added to existing security challenges, climate change could push the country into a national crisis, which is why some members of the U.S. intelligence community are worried.
“South America is of strategic importance, that’s pretty straightforward.” said one senior U.S. intelligence official. Climate change-induced water shortages in a country like Peru, which has limited coping mechanisms potentially are “destabilizing. And if that state is an important state to the United States, then it is a national security issue,” the official said.
‘There won’t be any more water’
Its ice is melting, but the majesty of Huascarán Mountain hasn’t diminished. Peru’s tallest mountain, its white peak still pierces the clouds on an overcast day in the Cordillera Blanca, part of the Andes range that stretches through Peru’s northwest department of Ancash.
Communities in the Cordillera Blanca still revere Huascarán for its beauty and the water it provides that allows them to survive in Peru’s extreme terrain, far from Lima and often beyond the reach of government services.
But over the last 20 years, they’ve watched Huascarán’s glacier start to disappear, the ice giving way to more black rock year after year.
“It used to take you two or three hours walking to reach the ice. But now you have to walk five, six hours to reach ice,” said Maximo Juan Malpaso Carranza, a farmer in Utupampa, a small community high in the Cordillera Blanca, as he installed a water pipe beneath the village’s dirt road to bring water from Huascarán to 105 houses.
“We all get water from there. That’s where the water source is,” he said, pointing to Huascarán. “But if the ice disappears, there won’t be any more water.”
Peru has lost 22 percent of its glaciers over the last 35 years, according to the Peruvian Ministry of Environment. Research by César Portocarrero, the Peruvian government’s lead glacier scientist, shows the Cordillera Blanca, which is home to one-quarter of the world’s tropical glaciers, has lost 30 percent of its glaciers since 1970. Parts of the Central Andes, the mountain range that supplies many of Peru’s coastal cities with water, have lost more 60 percent of their glaciers in the last 40 years.
“We know some glaciers could disappear in 20 years. We know this,” Portocarrero said.
The impact of glacier melt extends beyond the Andes. More than 2 million people, stretching from the Andes to the coastal cities, get their drinking water and irrigation from rivers fed by glacier runoff from Cordillera Blanca, according to Portocarrero’s studies. The secondary impacts of glacier melt will affect many more.
Life on Peru’s coast depends on water from the Andes. Most of its agriculture production is on the arid coast, fed by water from the Andes. Glacier-fed rivers also support the nation’s largest hydroelectric plants, which provide 60 percent of the country’s electricity.
Lima, the world’s second largest desert city, is almost totally dependent on Andean rivers fed by glacier melt. Water shortages are widespread there, and even worse in communities nearby that can’t compete with the capital for meager water supplies. Officials in Callao, a small port city next to Lima where 20 percent of the population is without water, fear further contamination of the dwindling supply will lead to outbreaks of dengue and cholera that could easily spread.
Rising conflicts, dwindling resources
Water conflicts have been frequent in southern Peru over the last few years, and many have turned fatal. Glacier melt will create more conflict over water resources that could affect the entire country, or, in extreme cases, conflicts with neighboring countries like Bolivia and Ecuador, countries with their own water problems, retired Maj. Gen. Luis Palomino Rodriguez, head of Peru’s National Civil Defense Institute, said in an interview.
Those water skirmishes have become a concern of U.S. officials. The 2007 Center for Naval Analyses report (pdf), a pivotal document that spearheaded high-level discussions about the security threat of climate change, says that Peru will “face a precarious situation” as the “loss of glaciers will strain water supply,” threatening the region stability. The National Intelligence Council warns (pdf) about social conflict over water as resources dwindle and demand for hydropower and crop irrigation rises.
The threat in the Andes has the Pentagon’s Southern Command more engaged in climate issues in the region, and Peru has emerged as a key partner. SouthCom and the State Department hosted a Climate Change and Regional Security Conference in Lima last June and plan to host a similar event next year for militaries from around the Western Hemisphere, said Myrna Lopez, an environmental security expert with SouthCom.
SouthCom started looking at the security impacts of climate change in 2008, but did not formalize its work on the issue until this year, when the 2010 Defense Department’s Quadrennial Defense Review (pdf) recognized climate change as a national security issue for the first time, according to Lopez.
SouthCom will release a new environmental security strategy in the coming months, but the military is far from integrating its climate change studies into operations.
“We have a lot to do,” Lopez said. “We’re not there yet where we have a complete buy-in from the DoD that this is a core military role.”

But now you have to walk five, six hours to reach ice,” said Maximo Juan Malpaso Carranza, a farmer in Utupampa, a small community high in the Cordillera Blanca, as he installed a water pipe beneath the village’s dirt road to bring water from Huascarán to 105 houses.</p><p>“We all get water from there. That’s where the water source is,” he said, pointing to Huascarán. “But if the ice disappears, there won’t be any more water.”</p><p>Peru has lost 22 percent of its glaciers over the last 35 years, according to the Peruvian Ministry of Environment. Research by César Portocarrero, the Peruvian government’s lead glacier scientist, shows the Cordillera Blanca, which is home to one-quarter of the world’s tropical glaciers, has lost 30 percent of its glaciers since 1970. Parts of the Central Andes, the mountain range that supplies many of Peru’s coastal cities with water, have lost more 60 percent of their glaciers in the last 40 years.</p><p>“We know some glaciers could disappear in 20 years. We know this,” Portocarrero said.</p><p>The impact of glacier melt extends beyond the Andes. More than 2 million people, stretching from the Andes to the coastal cities, get their drinking water and irrigation from rivers fed by glacier runoff from Cordillera Blanca, according to Portocarrero’s studies. The secondary impacts of glacier melt will affect many more.</p><p>Life on Peru’s coast depends on water from the Andes. Most of its agriculture production is on the arid coast, fed by water from the Andes. Glacier-fed rivers also support the nation’s largest hydroelectric plants, which provide 60 percent of the country’s electricity.</p><p>Lima, the world’s second largest desert city, is almost totally dependent on Andean rivers fed by glacier melt. Water shortages are widespread there, and even worse in communities nearby that can’t compete with the capital for meager water supplies.

Abstract
The harm of prostitution is socially invisible, and it is also invisible in the law, in public health, and in psychology. This article addresses origins of this invisibility, how words in current usage promote the invisibility of prostitution’s harm, and how public health perspectives and psychological theory tend to ignore the harm done by men to women in prostitution. Literature which documents the overwhelming physical and psychological harm to those in prostitution is summarized here. The interconnectedness of racism, colonialism, and child sexual assault with prostitution are discussed.¶ Introduction¶ Prostitution is sexual violence which results in economic profit for perpetrators. Other types of gender violence, such as incest, rape, and wife-beating are hidden and frequently denied, but they are not sources of mass revenue. Like slavery, prostitution is a lucrative form of oppression of human beings. Many governments protect commercial sex businesses because of the monstrous profits. Institutions such as prostitution and slavery, which have existed for thousands of years, are so deeply embedded in cultures that they become invisible. In Mauritania, for example, there are 90,000 Africans enslaved by Arabs. Human rights activists travel to Mauritania to report on slavery, but because they do not observe the stereotype of what they think slavery should look like – if they don’t see bidding for shackled people on auction blocks - they conclude that the Africans working (in slavery) in front of them are voluntary laborers who are receiving food and shelter as salary (Burkett, 1997).¶ In a similar way, if observers don’t observe the stereotype of “harmful” prostitution, for example, if they do not see a teenaged girl being trafficked at gunpoint from one country to another, if what they see is a streetwise teenager who says ‘I like this job, and I’m making a lot of money,’ then they don’t see the harm. Johns (customers) go to Atlanta, Amsterdam, Phnom Penh, Moscow, Capetown, or Havana and see smiling girls and women waving at them. The customers decide that prostitution is a free choice.¶ The social and legal refusal to acknowledge the harm of prostitution is stunning. Normalization of prostitution by researchers, public health agencies, and the law is a significant barrier to addressing the harm of prostitution. For example, the International Labor Organization described prostitution as the “sex sector” of Asian economies in spite of citing their own surveys which indicated that, in Indonesia, 96% of those interviewed wanted to leave prostitution if they could (Lim, 1998). It makes no sense to oppose trafficking on the one hand, and promote the “consensual sex sector” or “commercial sex work” on the other. One can not exist without the other; trafficking is the marketing of prostitution.¶ To assume that there is consent in the case of prostitution, is to disappear its harm. Social and legal assertion that there is consent involved in women’s oppression is not new. Rape law, for example, commonly inquires whether or not the woman consented to any sexual act, rather than asking if the rapist obtained her freely given affirmative permission without verbal or physical coercion. In situations of domestic violence, the question is often: “why did she agree to stay in the relationship?” rather than: “how did he cut off her physical and psychological ability to safely escape?” And in cases of sexual harassment, the question is: “did she invite, provoke, or welcome the behavior?” rather than: “did he use his position of authority to compromise her ability to resist?” Just as we have not moved beyond the obstacle of consent for raped, battered, or sexually harassed women, so we are also still at ground zero where prostitution is concerned. [1] The line between coercion and consent is deliberately blurred in prostitution. The politician’s insistence that prostitution is consensual parallels the john’s insistence that mutuality occurs in prostitution.¶ In prostitution, the conditions which make genuine consent possible are absent: physical safety, equal power with customers, and real alternatives (Hernandez, 2001). One woman in Amsterdam described prostitution as “volunteer slavery,” a description which reflects both the appearance of choice and the coercion behind that choice. Instead of the question, “did she consent?” the more relevant question would be: “did she have real alternatives to prostitution for survival?” As we will discuss below, it is a statistical, as well as an ethical error to assume that most women in prostitution consent to it.¶ There is no mutuality of consideration or pleasure in prostitution. The purpose of prostitution is to make sure that one person is object to the other’s subject, to make sure that one person does not use her personal desire to determine which sexual acts do and do not occur, while the other person acts on the basis of his personal desire. This is in stark contrast to non-commercial promiscuous, anonymous sex where both parties act on the basis of personal desire, and both parties are free to retract without economic consequences (Davidson, 1998). [2]¶ Invisibility¶ Words which conceal harm lead to confusion about the real nature of prostitution. Some words in current usage make the harm of prostitution invisible: voluntary prostitution which implies that she consented when usually, she actually had no other options to survive; forced trafficking, which implies that somewhere there are women who volunteer to be trafficked into prostitution; sex work, which defines prostitution as a job rather than an act of violence against women. The term migrant sex worker blends prostitution and trafficking and implies that both are acceptable. The Chinese words beautiful merchandise benevolently conceal the objectification of women in prostitution. The expression socially disadvantaged women (ostensibly used to avoid stigmatizing prostitutes) removes any hint of the sexual violence which is intrinsic to prostitution.¶ Libertarian or postmodern ideology obscures the harm of prostitution, defining it as a form of sex. The harshest sexual exploitation in strip club prostitution has been reframed as sexual expression or freedom to express one’s sensuality by dancing. Brothels are referred to as short-time hotels, massage parlors, saunas, and sometimes health clubs. Older men who buy teenagers for sex acts in Seoul call prostitution compensated dating. In Tokyo prostitution is described as assisted intercourse.¶ Men who buy women in prostitution are called interested parties or third parties, rather than johns, which is what women call customers. Pimps are described as boyfriends or managers. One pimp recently referred to the brief shelf life of a girl in prostitution. What that means is that he knows the extent of the damage in prostitution, and realizes that she will not be saleable after a few years. In the United States, the expression ‘ho reflects the widely accepted view of all women, and especially women of color, as natural-born whores. [3]¶ Women in prostitution are called escorts, hostesses, strippers, and dancers. Sometimes these words are attempts by women in prostitution to retain some shred of dignity. The purpose of exposing these words is not to remove women’s inherent dignity and worth, but to expose the brutal institution which harms them. What words can be used, without insulting women in prostitution? The expression sex worker implies that prostitution is an acceptable type of work (instead of brutal violence). We do not refer to battered women as “battering workers.” And just as we would not turn a woman into the harm done to her (we don’t refer to a woman who has been battered as a “batteree”) we should not call a woman who has been prostituted, a “prostitute.” We suggest retaining her humanity by referring to her as a woman who is in prostitution, who was prostituted or who is prostituting. We also use the word “john” which is the word women themselves use to refer to customers.¶ The lines between prostitution and nonprostitution have become increasingly blurred. Since the 1980s, there has been huge growth in socially legitimized pimping in the United States. For example, the amount of physical contact between stripclub employees and customers has escalated since 1980. Customers can usually buy either a table dance or a lap dance where the dancer sits on the customer’s lap while she wears few or no clothes and grinds her genitals against his. Although he is clothed, he usually expects ejaculation. The lap dance may take place on the main loor of the club or in a private room. The more private the sexual performance, the more it costs, and the more likely that violent sexual harassment or rape will occur.¶ Pervasive invisibility of the violence in prostitution¶ Despite the fact that prostitution is an institution in which one person has the social and economic power to transform a human being into the living embodiment of a masturbation fantasy (Davidson, 1998), psychotherapists and the public alike collude in viewing prostitution as banal or denying its harm altogether.¶ Prostitution formalizes women’s subordination by gender, race, and class. Poverty, racism, and sexism are inextricably connected in prostitution. Women are purchased because they are vulnerable as a result of lack of educational options, and as a result of previous physical and emotional harm. They are purchased on the basis of toxic ethnic and racial stereotypes.¶ For the vast majority of the world’s prostituted women, prostitution is the experience of being hunted, dominated, harassed, assaulted, and battered. Prostitution is a gendered survival strategy which involves the assumption of unreasonable risks by the person in it. Most of us would not be willing to assume these risks.",10023.0,"<h4>This <u>formalizes</u> gendered violence and exploitation – academic theorists, unrepresentative narratives, and cognitive bias ensure that violence against prostitutes is underrecognized </h4><p><strong>Farley 3</strong> – PhD, clinical psychologist and member of the American Psychological Association</p><p>Melissa, “Prostitution and the Invisibility of Harm” [http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/FarleyProstitution%26InvisibleHarm2003.pdf] //</p><p>Abstract</p><p><u><strong><mark>The harm of prostitution is socially invisible</u>, <u>and</mark> it is also invisible <mark>in</mark> the <mark>law</mark>, in public health, <mark>and</mark> in <mark>psychology</strong></mark>. </u>This article addresses origins of this invisibility, how words in current usage promote the invisibility of prostitution’s harm, and how public health perspectives and psychological theory tend to ignore the harm done by men to women in prostitution.

What words can be used, without insulting women in prostitution? The expression sex worker implies that prostitution is an acceptable type of work (instead of brutal violence). We do not refer to battered women as “battering workers.” And just as we would not turn a woman into the harm done to her (we don’t refer to a woman who has been battered as a “batteree”) we should not call a woman who has been prostituted, a “prostitute.” We suggest retaining her humanity by referring to her as a woman who is in prostitution, who was prostituted or who is prostituting. We also use the word “john” which is the word women themselves use to refer to customers.¶ The lines between prostitution and nonprostitution have become increasingly blurred. Since the 1980s, there has been huge growth in socially legitimized pimping in the United States. For example, the amount of physical contact between stripclub employees and customers has escalated since 1980. Customers can usually buy either a table dance or a lap dance where the dancer sits on the customer’s lap while she wears few or no clothes and grinds her genitals against his. Although he is clothed, he usually expects ejaculation. The lap dance may take place on the main loor of the club or in a private room. The more private the sexual performance, the more it costs, and the more likely that violent sexual harassment or rape will occur.¶ Pervasive invisibility of the violence in prostitution¶ <u><strong><mark>Despite the fact that prostitution is an institution in which one person has the</mark> social and economic <mark>power to transform a human being into the living embodiment of a masturbation fantasy</u></strong></mark> (Davidson, 1998), <u><strong><mark>psychotherapists and the public</mark> alike <mark>collude</mark> <mark>in viewing prostitution as banal</mark> or denying its harm altogether</u>.</strong>¶ <u><strong><mark>Prostitution formalizes women’s subordination by gender, race, and class</u></strong></mark>. Poverty, racism, and sexism are inextricably connected in prostitution. <u><mark>Women are purchased because they are vulnerable as a result</mark> <mark>of lack of education</mark>al options, <mark>and</mark> as a result of previous <mark>physical and emotional harm</u></mark>. <u>They are purchased on the basis of toxic ethnic and racial stereotypes.¶</u> <u><mark>For the vast majority</u></mark> of the world’s prostituted women, <u><mark>prostitution is the experience of being hunted, dominated, harassed, assaulted, and battered</u>.</mark> <u><mark>Prostitution is a gendered survival strategy</mark> which involves the assumption of unreasonable risks by the person in it. Most of us would not be willing to assume these risks.</p></u>",,1nc k,,434156,1,17422,./documents/ndtceda14/Georgetown/KaKn/Georgetown-Kazteridis-Knez-Neg-Wake-Round3.docx,566271,N,Wake,3,Cornell Knight-Gunn,Stone,,ndtceda14/Georgetown/KaKn/Georgetown-Kazteridis-Knez-Neg-Wake-Round3.docx,,48540,KaKn,Georgetown KaKn,,An.....,Ka.....,Na.....,Kn.....,18773,Georgetown,Georgetown,,,1004,ndtceda14,NDT/CEDA 2014-15,2014,cx,college,2

Yet, there is no indication that Canadians are willing to sacrifice their current social system of extensive benefits for a much larger military budget and Arctic force. And, there is no evidence that Canadians want to pay much more in taxes or commit to a military draft. Canada has only around 70,000 active-duty military personnel, 30,000 reserve forces, and a $20 billion/year military budget. Its Arctic-ready forces and equipment are just a handful, a few thousand personnel at best who are truly specialists, mainly the Canadian Rangers. Moreover, there is no indication that Canada’s economy will greatly expand in the foreseeable future to produce the necessary surplus wealth to pay for a sizeable increase in an Arctic force. Canada’s economic growth has not been great over the last decade, let alone ever. Thus, Canada presents a very vocal case for the Arctic but has been unable to completely back up its claims with the necessary increases in personnel, materials, ships, and money, which is very telling for the future. If not by now, then when?17 If Canada is unwilling to shift or produce enough resources to create a sufficient Arctic force that is capable of fully securing the region over the three thousand miles of waterways, plus above and beneath the surface, then it opens up the possibility that other forces outside the region may move in and claim the trillions of dollars in natural resources. Russia is an obvious pursuer. The U.S. is another option. China, with its massively growing need for oil—especially when it runs out of much of its own domestic sources in approximately 10 years—will be looking everywhere for oil opportunities. Any country that can move oil rigs and mining companies into the Arctic area, operate them and maintain them, and have enough forces to possibly defend them will have trillions of reasons to act pro-actively. Hypothetical but quite possible. Can or will Canada defend this entire region on its own? Can or will Canadians risk an all-out war with Russia, China, or some other major power for control over all of the Arctic resources? Is Canada even capable of going into the ring against any of the major powers, especially if and when there is a great need and crisis in energy resources?18 Canada can make many public proclamations and scholarly materials on its claims to the Arctic, but its inability or unwillingness to move aggressively to secure the emerging Arctic region is a signal to all that this could become an open-season area in the near future. The Arctic is increasingly looking like the grounds for a potential rivalry similar to the Western World’s colonization, an Oklahoma land rush, a California gold rush, and of course an Alaskan and Klondike gold rush. Maybe all rolled up into one. There are so many valuable resources in this Arctic area that one can only imagine how aggressively countries will act in the coming years and decades as natural resources become increasingly scarce and they become increasingly desperate for more resources and revenues. The massive amount of resources in the Arctic are there for the taking unless Canada is willing to make significant sacrifices to secure the area. Much greater taxation, a major reduction in social welfare benefits, lower wages, longer work hours, much greater economic production, and a significantly larger military that may require a draft, are all one and together necessary options if Canada is to establish fully a sizeable force to secure the entire Arctic region on its side year-round. Canadians spent years debating whether or not to spend the money for 6-8 ships for the Arctic, which is miniscule but indicative of Canadian priorities and intentions. Much greater resources and sacrifices have to be made. Ironically, Canadians may have to give up being Canadian and become more like Americans in order to make and implement the necessary policy changes and play successfully the game of power politics. So far, most Canadians do not appear willing to give up most of what it is to be Canadian. But, will this change in the future?19 Canadians can hope that other countries do not eventually move into the Arctic region, but it appears increasingly obvious that Canadians are passing the torch and initiative to other countries to make the final decision. Canadians, of course, will reject this but the lack of major action and investment in the Arctic region over the past several decades suggest that Canada’s claims to the region rests more on political and legal talk than real power and action. There has been no indication for the last several years in which the Arctic is now being freely traversed year-round that Canadians have changed in any significant way. If Canadians have chosen to rest their claims on the hope that other countries in the future will sacrifice their wealth, power, and standard of living, let alone trillions of dollars in economic opportunities, just on their own goodwill or moral conscience, then it would be a truly dangerous gamble for Canadians. But, in the end, if Canadians are not willing to make the major sacrifices to protect the Arctic and all of its resources, then it is their free choice. Other countries will take note and act accordingly when the time is right and the imperative arises. Power usually trumps legal arguments and paper trails. The Arctic may be the quintessential example in the future.20 The U.S. Perspective and Future Interests and Policy The United States may sooner or later come to the official recognition that Canada does not appear willing to commit the necessary resources to maintain adequate security in the Arctic. It may already have done so, unofficially. The U.S. has maintained some strategic forces in the region, mainly submarines, but the U.S. has yet to make anywhere near the aggressive moves and forces as Russia. The U.S. does not have a modern fleet of Arctic icebreakers, but it certainly has the capability to build one. The Russians are expanding rapidly in the Arctic region in terms of claims, exploration, and slowly but surely oil and mining activities. The U.S. must soon determine its policy on this matter or else the Russians may make the decision for it. The U.S. has worked with Canada on joint security throughout the Cold War, mainly through NORAD and the multiple layers of radar across Canada up to the Arctic. Both the U.S. and Canada have laid down many sonar devices as well. The primary threats to both countries for much of the last half century have been Russian submarines, bombers, and ICBMs. There is less of a threat now with the end of the Cold War, but the security issue remains and could emerge again in the near future.21 The existing international security and energy situations are precarious. Any Middle East crisis that cuts off significant amounts of oil will lead many countries to desperately search for new oil reserves to quickly replenish their lost ones. How long the Arctic will remain off the front stage of world affairs is a question that may be answered sooner rather than later. In the future, the greatest threat to U.S. interests in the Arctic may be Canada’s inability or unwillingness to develop an adequate security plan and force to the emerging economic opportunities in the Arctic. The U.S. does not recognize Canada’s claim to the waterways and, thus, cannot establish an official joint security program in areas in which it does not recognize Canadian sovereignty. Canada cannot do this as well without a major diplomatic backlash by the U.S. and others. Neither side can maintain a fiction for long without having the other renounce its claims and oppose its policy. Thus, strategic threats to North America above and below the Arctic may continue to be addressed jointly by the U.S. and Canada through NORAD and other existing security bodies, but the emerging economic opportunities and subsequent security threats have yet to lead to a plausible joint policy program or organization. This, in the end, may require multinational negotiations or bilateral and individual actions vis-à-vis other countries outside the area. But, this likely will be a very weak and limited policy option with highly questionable results. The U.S. needs to address this growing threat with Canada, the international community, and its own energy and mining corporations. There must be a multiple-track approach of trying to establish an international convention on the Arctic, possibly similar to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, and trying to ensure the U.S.’s future energy needs to sustain its growing and modern society. But, Canada’s adamant claims to the Arctic may undermine this possible convention because it presupposes international waterways and not Canadian sovereignty. On the other hand, the U.S. may have to be prepared to go it alone and open up the way for its own companies to move in and exploit the area for its own best interests as well as to prevent other countries from doing so. This would be preemptive action on the U.S.’s part. And, it would give American companies trillions of new opportunities, as well as give the U.S. more than enough oil to last for several more decades if not to the end of the century. But, this could set off a major race by other countries into the Arctic to establish economic and territorial claims and this may lead to serious conflict. Thus, an Arctic Regime seems imperative. Yet, any one country, especially a minor one, claiming sole possession over approximately half of the Arctic appears to be a non-starter or game breaker. The U.S. expects equal and free access to much of the Arctic. Canada, therefore, appears to be the primary obstacle in the U.S.’s eyes to the creation of any future Arctic Regime.22",9930.0,"<h4>Economic growth is vital for Canadian military investments in the Arctic – that prevents global conflict </h4><p><strong>Dobransky 12</strong> (Steve, Adjunct Prof of PoliSci @ Cleveland State, ""Military Security, Energy Resources, and the Emergence of the Northwest Passage: Canada’s Arctic Dilemma,"" http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0106/ca/dobransky_arctic.html)</p><p>If Canada is to achieve its territorial and diplomatic ambitions, then it likely requires a much greater civilian and military presence in the Arctic all year-round.

On the other hand, the U.S. may have to be prepared to go it alone and open up the way for its own companies to move in and exploit the area for its own best interests as well as to prevent other countries from doing so. This would be preemptive action on the U.S.’s part. And, it would give American companies trillions of new opportunities, as well as give the U.S. more than enough oil to last for several more decades if not to the end of the century. But, this could set off a major race by other countries into the Arctic to establish economic and territorial claims and this may lead to serious conflict. Thus, an Arctic Regime seems imperative. Yet, any one country, especially a minor one, claiming sole possession over approximately half of the Arctic appears to be a non-starter or game breaker. The U.S. expects equal and free access to much of the Arctic. Canada, therefore, appears to be the primary obstacle in the U.S.’s eyes to the creation of any future Arctic Regime.22",9930.0,"<h4>Economic growth is vital for Canadian military investments in the Arctic – that prevents global conflict </h4><p><strong>Dobransky 12</strong> (Steve, Adjunct Prof of PoliSci @ Cleveland State, ""Military Security, Energy Resources, and the Emergence of the Northwest Passage: Canada’s Arctic Dilemma,"" http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0106/ca/dobransky_arctic.html)</p><p>If Canada is to achieve its territorial and diplomatic ambitions, then it likely requires a much greater civilian and military presence in the Arctic all year-round. Yet, there is no indication that Canadians are willing to sacrifice their current social system of extensive benefits for a much larger military budget and Arctic force. And, there is no evidence that Canadians want to pay much more in taxes or commit to a military draft. Canada has only around 70,000 active-duty military personnel, 30,000 reserve forces, and a $20 billion/year military budget. Its Arctic-ready forces and equipment are just a handful, a few thousand personnel at best who are truly specialists, mainly the Canadian Rangers. Moreover, <u><strong>there is no <mark>indication that Canada’s economy will greatly expand in the foreseeable future to produce the necessary surplus wealth to pay </mark>for a sizeable increase in <mark>an Arctic force</u></strong></mark>. Canada’s economic growth has not been great over the last decade, let alone ever. Thus, Canada presents a very vocal case for the Arctic but has been unable to completely back up its claims with the necessary increases in personnel, materials, ships, and money, which is very telling for the future. If not by now, then when?17 <u><strong>If Canada is unwilling to shift or produce enough resources to create a sufficient Arctic force</u></strong> that is capable of fully securing the region over the three thousand miles of waterways, plus above and beneath the surface, <u><strong>then it opens up the possibility that <mark>other forces outside the region may move in and claim the trillions of dollars in natural resources</mark>. Russia is an obvious pursuer. The U.S. is another option. China</u></strong>, with its massively growing need for oil—especially when it runs out of much of its own domestic sources in approximately 10 years—<u><strong>will be looking</u></strong> everywhere for oil opportunities. Any country that can move oil rigs and mining companies into the Arctic area, operate them and maintain them, and have enough forces to possibly defend them will have trillions of reasons to act pro-actively. Hypothetical but quite possible. Can or will Canada defend this entire region on its own? Can or will Canadians risk an all-out war with Russia, China, or some other major power for control over all of the Arctic resources? Is Canada even capable of going into the ring against any of the major powers, especially if and when there is a great need and crisis in energy resources?18 Canada can make many public proclamations and scholarly materials on its claims to the Arctic, but its inability or unwillingness to move aggressively to secure the emerging Arctic region is a signal to all that this could become an open-season area in the near future. <u><strong><mark>The Arctic is increasingly looking like the grounds for a potential rivalry</u></strong></mark> similar to the Western World’s colonization, an Oklahoma land rush, a California gold rush, and of course an Alaskan and Klondike gold rush. Maybe all rolled up into one. There are so many valuable resources in this Arctic area that <u><strong>one can only imagine how aggressively countries will act</u></strong> in the coming years and decades as natural resources become increasingly scarce and they become increasingly desperate for more resources and revenues. <u><strong>The massive amount of resources in the Arctic are there for the taking unless Canada is willing to make significant sacrifices to secure the area</u></strong>. Much greater taxation, a major reduction in social welfare benefits, lower wages, longer work hours, much greater economic production, and a significantly larger military that may require a draft, are all one and together necessary options if Canada is to establish fully a sizeable force to secure the entire Arctic region on its side year-round. Canadians spent years debating whether or not to spend the money for 6-8 ships for the Arctic, which is miniscule but indicative of Canadian priorities and intentions. Much greater resources and sacrifices have to be made. Ironically, Canadians may have to give up being Canadian and become more like Americans in order to make and implement the necessary policy changes and play successfully the game of power politics. So far, most Canadians do not appear willing to give up most of what it is to be Canadian. But, will this change in the future?19 Canadians can hope that other countries do not eventually move into the Arctic region, but it appears increasingly obvious that Canadians are passing the torch and initiative to other countries to make the final decision. Canadians, of course, will reject this but the lack of major action and investment in the Arctic region over the past several decades suggest that Canada’s claims to the region rests more on political and legal talk than real power and action. There has been no indication for the last several years in which the Arctic is now being freely traversed year-round that Canadians have changed in any significant way. If Canadians have chosen to rest their claims on the hope that other countries in the future will sacrifice their wealth, power, and standard of living, let alone trillions of dollars in economic opportunities, just on their own goodwill or moral conscience, then it would be a truly dangerous gamble for Canadians. But, in the end, if Canadians are not willing to make the major sacrifices to protect the Arctic and all of its resources, then it is their free choice. Other countries will take note and act accordingly when the time is right and the imperative arises. Power usually trumps legal arguments and paper trails. The Arctic may be the quintessential example in the future.20 The U.S. Perspective and Future Interests and Policy The United States may sooner or later come to the official recognition that Canada does not appear willing to commit the necessary resources to maintain adequate security in the Arctic. It may already have done so, unofficially. The U.S. has maintained some strategic forces in the region, mainly submarines, but the U.S. has yet to make anywhere near the aggressive moves and forces as Russia. The U.S. does not have a modern fleet of Arctic icebreakers, but it certainly has the capability to build one. <u><strong>The Russians are expanding rapidly in the Arctic region</u></strong> in terms of claims, exploration, and slowly but surely oil and mining activities. The U.S. must soon determine its policy on this matter or else the Russians may make the decision for it. The U.S. has worked with Canada on joint security throughout the Cold War, mainly through NORAD and the multiple layers of radar across Canada up to the Arctic. Both the U.S. and Canada have laid down many sonar devices as well. The primary threats to both countries for much of the last half century have been Russian submarines, bombers, and ICBMs. There is less of a threat now with the end of the Cold War, but the security issue remains and could emerge again in the near future.21 The existing international security and energy situations are precarious. Any Middle East crisis that cuts off significant amounts of oil will lead many countries to desperately search for new oil reserves to quickly replenish their lost ones. How long the Arctic will remain off the front stage of world affairs is a question that may be answered sooner rather than later. In the future<u><strong><mark>, the greatest threat to U.S. interests </mark>in the Arctic <mark>may be Canada’s inability or unwillingness to develop an adequate security plan</mark> and force</u></strong> to the emerging economic opportunities <u><strong>in the Arctic</u></strong>. The U.S. does not recognize Canada’s claim to the waterways and, thus, cannot establish an official joint security program in areas in which it does not recognize Canadian sovereignty. Canada cannot do this as well without a major diplomatic backlash by the U.S. and others. Neither side can maintain a fiction for long without having the other renounce its claims and oppose its policy. Thus, strategic threats to North America above and below the Arctic may continue to be addressed jointly by the U.S. and Canada through NORAD and other existing security bodies, but the emerging economic opportunities and subsequent security threats have yet to lead to a plausible joint policy program or organization. This, in the end, may require multinational negotiations or bilateral and individual actions vis-à-vis other countries outside the area. But, this likely will be a very weak and limited policy option with highly questionable results. The U.S. needs to address <u><strong>this growing threat</u></strong> with Canada, the international community, and its own energy and mining corporations. There must be a multiple-track approach of trying to establish an international convention on the Arctic, possibly similar to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, and trying to ensure the U.S.’s future energy needs to sustain its growing and modern society. But, Canada’s adamant claims to the Arctic may undermine this possible convention because it presupposes international waterways and not Canadian sovereignty.

The military took control, and a civil war followed, which pitted Arabs against Berbers, Muslims against non-Muslims, and Islamist against moderates. This was one of the most brutal civil wars in African history, which resulted in over two hundred thousand people being slaughtered (Porter 2013). The war ended in 2002, followed by a wave of terrorist activity, which continues today; there has been over five hundred fatalities, including that of foreign oil and gas employees. Algeria is one of the most corrupt, brutal and inept regimes in the world, which includes an appalling human rights record (current rating in global corruption105/176). It has an elected civilian President (Abdelaziz Bouteflika) supported by the powerful military (Global Corruption Report of Transparency International 2013). Algeria generates approximately one third of all of North Africa’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). There is little in terms of infrastructure for health, education and housing to substantiate this claim. Algeria consists of forty million inhabitants of diverse ethno political groups with a complex nexus of geo-political state and non-state actors, controlled by Arab Muslims (majority) and Indigenous Berbers. Challenges remain for the Algerian leaders in maintaining peace and stability in Algeria. With high youth unemployment and ethno-political tensions, Algeria remains volatile and unstable, both politically and socially (Maddy-Weitzman 2006). In the last decade, there has been sporadic confrontations and riots between the Berber youth and the Algerian authorities. Demands for greater freedom, for example: include official recognition of the Berber language, culture and greater autonomy, whilst protest have resulted 4 in the deaths of many youth in the Tizi Ouzou province (Berber spiritual home) (Maddy- Weitzman 2006). Furthermore, the Muslim Arab Algeria, which transited from a French Algeria, has achieved little to encourage solid foundations and good relations between Algeria’s Arabs and Algeria’s indigenous Berbers (Wuite 2012). Tensions remain on the streets of Algeria after the Algerian youth protest in 2011. There has been little success by the government to create opportunities for the growing youth unemployment in Algeria. Oil and gas remains the dominant industry, with no other major growth sectors in existence (Kolster 2012). The Algerian government were recently forced to make concessions to housing and an increase in social services such as health and education. This was because of the ‘Arab uprising’ sweeping across Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Young Algerians are not inspired by the government reforms, and many still attempt the hazardous journey across the Mediterranean to Europe. Most die, or are sent back to Algeria (Daragahi 2012; Prior 2013). Appeasing the youth of Algeria may be a bigger challenge to the security apparatus than that of terrorism, “and or” the growing discord among the Berber population in the coming decade. The antagonisation of all three groups would create a scenario reminiscent of the civil war. The disruption to the global energy markets would be devastating (Daragahi 2012). The relationship between Algeria and its neighbours has dramatically shifted since the Arab Springs. The dispute over the Western Sahara with Morocco remains tense. There has been inconsistent dialogue with the US acting as an intermediary. The borders between Morocco and Algeria remain closed. There have been talks to discuss the reopening of the border, but little has been resolved to move forward. Opening the borders would economically transform the region for both Algeria and Morocco for all sectors, including the energy sector (Kolster 2012). The fall of the Libyan and Tunisian regimes in 2011 resulted in a shift and refocus for Algerian security on its Eastern Saharan borders. It has been a relatively stable border region between Libya, Tunisia and Algeria during the 20 st century. But this is changing as governments remain unstable. It is particularly a concern for the energy sector as Tunisia is a transit point for the Trans-Mediterranean Pipeline to Europe from Algeria. In addition, both Tunisia and Libya have become a hotbed for armed Jihadist from around the globe (Alexander 2012). Relations between Algeria and the USA have emerged reasonably strong over the last decade. This is due to Algeria’s attempt to counter terrorism in Algeria, and the region in general. In addition, Algeria remains a key supplier of petroleum to the USA and gas to it European neighbours, which includes USA investments. Algeria receives what the US 5 congress calls ‘development aid’. Algeria purchases significant amounts of weaponry from the US, including benefiting from US collaboration programs (Arieff 2013a). The insurgent war in Mali in 2012/2013 created a new problem for the Algerian authorities. It encouraged a new stream of jihadist to the region, strengthened AQIM, whilst old tensions re- emerged with France over its military involvement in the conflict, close to Algeria’s borders. This war was brief. But the fact remains that a conflict on Algeria’s borders can occur and this is a concern to Algeria and the broader region in the coming decade (Gilmor 2013; Arieff & Johnson 2013b). Terrorist militant groups operating in the Maghreb and Sahel are taking advantage of Algeria’s open and unpoliced desert. These groups are enjoying a resurgence after the recent uprisings in Libya, Tunisia and Mali and are consolidating to become a powerful regional threat. They are a menace to the oil and gas industry in Algeria and the region (Alexander 2012). Their ability to make an impact is evident by the recent events in Mali, Libya and the Amenas gas facility. Multinational oil and gas companies have expressed concern to the Algerian authorities about security in remote locations around the Saharan Desert. Furthermore, lives are being lost, whilst attacks have the ability to disrupt oil and gas supplies to the world, which may have an impact on global prices and the local Algerian economy, which would experience a severe downturn and create social problems in an already volatile region. This would be disastrous for Algeria’s stability, including disruption to global oil and gas markets. Amenas: a case study What is considered to be the most successfully orchestrated terrorist attack on an oil and gas plant in history, was executed on the 16 th of January 2013 in Amenas, Algeria. The terrorist siege lasted four days and resulted in the deaths of forty foreign oil and gas employees. There was a delayed response from the Algerian security forces because of the geographical location of the gas plant, which is located in one of the most isolated regions on the planet. This site is situated approximately fifty kilometres from the Libyan border (unmanned), and a thousand kilometres south of Algiers, the capital city of Algeria. Appendix three – map one. On site that day were a hundred and thirty foreign employees and six hundred Algerian nationals. This was the perfect target for the terrorists who are fervently opposed to multinational companies and westerners in Algeria and the Maghreb (Trindal 2013). It has been reported that some of the Algerian nationals (staff) were acting as insiders for AQIM and pre-planning and execution; one of them was a driver for foreigners. Due to the recent upheaval in Libya, the terrorists have been able to take advantage of safe operating 6 camps across the border. This is making it relatively easy to enter Algeria and threatening oil and gas sites to create havoc (Wolf & Lefevre 2013). This security incident is a turning point for the Algerian and world energy sectors. It has exposed the vulnerability of the energy industry in Algeria and the ability of terrorists to create and disrupt oil and gas supplies throughout the world in the 21 st century. Geographically remote infrastructure such as Amenas is normally a deterrent to potential attackers due to the logistical operation to execute such a brazen strike. Statoil's investigation leader, Hagen (2013, p.5) states ""It clearly demonstrates that companies like Statoil today face serious security threats around the world."" The terrorist group used the same brand of cars that are used by the gas plant, and signage placed on the vehicle to resemble the company’s logos operating from the complex. This also indicated that the screening process of Algerian nationals failed due to the inside information acquired by the terrorists. The terrorists executed their campaign from their satellite headquarters in Libya, which is now an incubator for global jihadists because of the security dysfunction after the downfall of Colonel Gaddafi. Using weapons left over by the generosity of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) forces, facilitated their campaign (Trindal 2013). Without detection, the militants penetrated the semi-protected complex by driving their vehicles through the gates, gathered seven hundred staff, and seized control of the entire compound. Furthermore, Algerian intelligence and other authorities failed in detecting “and or” preventing the militants from not only making it to the complex, but seizing the compound where they murdered both Algerian and foreign nationals. The question remains: has the Algerian government and the energy industry around the world learnt from the mistakes at Amenas? Reliance on military regimes such as the Algerians security forces exploited a weakness in the energy security apparatus in Algeria and possibly the world, resulting in the mass murder of innocent men and a downturn in the global gas markets (Trindal 2013).

The Ninth Amendment is my prime tool to facilitate this,"The Ninth Amendment reads as follows, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people"". I believe this amendment was an ingenious compromise as well as a solution to Madison and Hamilton's concerns. Similarly, the Tenth Amendment clarified the powers, jurisdictions, and rights of governments. The United States Constitution spells out the powers, juridictions, and rights the federal government is entitled to. Any of these not granted to them within the Constitution are automatically placed under the purview of the individual states. I am going to concentrate on the Ninth Amendment within this Hub and save my analysis of the Tenth Amendment for another article. I believe that both amendments perfectly display the wisdom of the creators of the Constitution. Unfortunately, at least in my view, the Ninth Amendment has been hugely underutilized and often ignored. I will begin this Hub by describing some of the arguments the Founding Fathers wrestled with before creating this amendment. Then I will give a brief history of the instances where the Ninth Amendment was used both unsuccessfully as well as successfully. Finally I will attempt to convey my own vision of how I feel this unique and wise amendment should be used now and in the future to ensure that the rights and welfare of American citizens are protected more fully. The United States Constitution was argued over and written at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787. The Articles of Confederation, which were governing the U.S. at this time, had proven itself to be too weak and ineffective to allow the government to operative efficiently and productively. The subject of including a Bill of Rights was discussed at this convention but was never agreed upon or included in the original Constitution. The ratification by the states of this newly proposed Constitution was far from assured. Many states and political leaders were insisting upon a Bill of Rights being incorporated into it before they would ratify the document. Thomas Jefferson and other anti-Federalists were extremely wary of the stronger federal powers that this new Constitution would install. Jefferson convinced a reluctant Madison to develop and submit a Bill of Rights which would act as a barrier against the federal government infringing upon its citizens rights. An understanding was finally reached which entailed instructions for the first United States Congress to develop and pass a Bill of Rights. The Constitutional Convention completed and signed the new Constitution on December 17, 1788. This document was submitted to the thirteen individual states for ratification. All thirteen did so but only after some very bruising battles in each state. On September 13, 1788 the Constitution was finally certified and it became the governing document of the United States. James Madison submitted his proposal for the Bill of Rights to the first Congress on June 8, 1789. The Bill of Rights was passed by Congress on September 25, 1789. It was sent to the states for ratification and became law and part of the United States Constitution on December 15, 1791. The Ninth Amendment has proven to be a very elusive amendment to define and interpret from its very inception. The Founding Fathers stated that the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights were by no means the only ones essential to United States citizens as well as all human beings. The problem then arises as to how we determine what other rights are also to be retained by the people. Most strict constructionists argue that the only way to recognize other rights not already enumerated would be to pass Constitutional Amendments. What then is the utility of the Ninth Amendment if that is the case? The first constitutional case where the Ninth Amendment was even vaguely referred to was was in Barron v. Baltimore in 1833. The Supreme Court ruled that the Ninth Amendment and all of the original ten amendments could only be considered in federal cases. The first case where the Ninth Amendment was used directly was United Public Workers (UPW) v. Mitchell in 1947. The case challenged the Hatch Act of 1939 which restricted political activities of federal employees. The House of Representatives discovered that the UPW had supported several candidates and parties for federal office. The union's argument against the Hatch Act was that the Constitution did not give the federal government the power to restrict their campaign activities. Therefore the Ninth Amendment confers the right to these activities because they are thus retained by the people. The Court ruled against the UPW and upheld Congress' authority under the Constitution to legislate as they did. The Ninth Amendment did not receive a victory in the Supreme Court until 1965 by way of the Griswold v. Connecticut case. This case challenged a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of any medicines or instruments to prevent pregnancy. Estelle Griswold was the Executive Director of the Connecticut Planned Parenthood and her branch opened a birth control center. The Supreme Court ruled by a 7-2 margin that this law violated marital privacy. They used the Ninth Amendment as the direct basis for recognizing this implicit right. They extended this right to unmarried couples in the 1972 Eisenstadt v. Baird case. In 1973 the Supreme Court used this ""Right to Privacy"" and extended it while helping to decide the Roe v. Wade abortion case. Unfortunately the Court decided to use the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause as its primary citation. The lower district court had used the Ninth Amendment as their primary justification for allowing women to have abortions if they chose to because they had a right to privacy. The Ninth Amendment has only been used in supporting roles since this decision. The current makeup of the Supreme Court is much more conservative than in the recent past. It is thus very unlikely to consider most or any Ninth Amendment arguments. The reason for this is that this amendment does not explicitly name any particular rights. Most conservative justices are anathema to citing this amendment in their decisions for that reason. The Ninth Amendment clearly has a thin history in regards to Supreme Court cases. Privacy rights are the only rights that the Court has been willing to extrapolate from it. Even then they needed support from other amendments. The current conservative Supreme Court will most likely never use the Ninth Amendment or any others to recognize other implicit Constitutional rights. A more progressive Supreme Court will be needed for that. What should a more progressive Court look to do in regards to using the Ninth Amendment to recognize other rights? I believe they should look to identifying the essential life sustaining rights of all people. One that immediately comes to mind is healthcare. The Healthcare industry is no longer the basic and inexpensive profession of previous generations. Drug development costs, complex and expensive diagnostic medical equipment, and expensive hospital expenses are among the many factors that have dramatically ballooned the size of medical bills. Most American citizens cannot afford proper healthcare if left on their own to purchase it. This is due to the massive cost. Currently most people receive their healthcare insurance through their employer. The elderly receive it through the government by way of Medicare. Americans who are not employed or elderly have no access to affordable healthcare insurance. This is because they do not have the benefit of access to pooled insurance that spreads risk. The result is that most unemployed Americans go without this vital need because they cannot afford the insurance. I submit that this condition is cruel, inhumane, and unfair. I propose that National Healthcare Insurance should be mandatory for all Americans because it is an implied right that can be derived from the Ninth Amendment. Medical care is almost as necessary to human existence as food and water. How can we in all good conscience effectively deprive many Americans of this essential life sustaining service? I say that we should not and cannot. My belief is just as privacy rights have been upheld as implicit by the Supreme Court by way of the Ninth Amendment, so should essential human needs such as affordable healthcare be upheld as implicit rights. James Madison could never have imagined healthcare becoming as expensive as it is now and thus becoming an urgent need and perhaps even a right. That is why Madison created the Ninth Amendment. He knew that the eight amendments that he wrote for the first Congress could never encompass all rights that citizens are entitled to. This was as true for that time with its less complex issues and technology as it is now. The Founding Fathers probably felt that privacy rights were implicit within the Fourth Amendment. Unfortunately this was only partly true and only in regards to unreasonable searches. Thus the Supreme Court extended it to privacy by way of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. Why not use the Ninth Amendment for a right to affordable healthcare and other life sustaining needs? I know this is an unconventional and most likely controversial view. Most worthwhile ideas start out that way. I believe it is about time we started considering the Ninth Amendment more broadly to protect American citizens from the deprivation of life sustaining needs and rights. Our economic system has become an increasingly cruel and unequal system that casts its unfortunate citizens outside the system to make do for themselves. I believe it is now time to become innovative to correct these injustices. The Ninth Amendment is my prime tool to facilitate this. The neglect of this wise and ingenious amendment should end now. We need to put it to proper use to protect all of our fellow Americans.",9987.0,"<h4>Progressive readings of the Ninth Amendment key to securing universal healthcare </h4><p><strong>Schneider 12</strong> (H, Financial Services Professional + political contributor @ Hubpages, ""The Genius And The Neglect Of The Ninth Amendment,"" 11/5, http://hschneider.hubpages.com/hub/The-Genius-And-The-Neglect-Of-The-Ninth-Amendment)</p><p>The Ninth Amendment reads as follows, ""The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people"".

Many states and political leaders were insisting upon a Bill of Rights being incorporated into it before they would ratify the document. Thomas Jefferson and other anti-Federalists were extremely wary of the stronger federal powers that this new Constitution would install. Jefferson convinced a reluctant Madison to develop and submit a Bill of Rights which would act as a barrier against the federal government infringing upon its citizens rights. An understanding was finally reached which entailed instructions for the first United States Congress to develop and pass a Bill of Rights. The Constitutional Convention completed and signed the new Constitution on December 17, 1788. This document was submitted to the thirteen individual states for ratification. All thirteen did so but only after some very bruising battles in each state. On September 13, 1788 the Constitution was finally certified and it became the governing document of the United States. James Madison submitted his proposal for the Bill of Rights to the first Congress on June 8, 1789. The Bill of Rights was passed by Congress on September 25, 1789. It was sent to the states for ratification and became law and part of the United States Constitution on December 15, 1791. <u><mark>The Ninth Amendment has proven</mark> to be a very <mark>elusive</mark> amendment to define and interpret from its very inception</u>. <u>The Founding Fathers stated that the first eight amendments of the Bill of Rights were by no means the only ones essential to United States citizens as well as all human beings. The problem then arises as to <mark>how we determine what</mark> other <mark>rights are</mark> also to be <mark>retained by the people</u></mark>. Most strict constructionists argue that the only way to recognize other rights not already enumerated would be to pass Constitutional Amendments. What then is the utility of the Ninth Amendment if that is the case? The first constitutional case where the Ninth Amendment was even vaguely referred to was was in Barron v. Baltimore in 1833. The Supreme Court ruled that the Ninth Amendment and all of the original ten amendments could only be considered in federal cases. The first case where the Ninth Amendment was used directly was United Public Workers (UPW) v. Mitchell in 1947. The case challenged the Hatch Act of 1939 which restricted political activities of federal employees. The House of Representatives discovered that the UPW had supported several candidates and parties for federal office. The union's argument against the Hatch Act was that the Constitution did not give the federal government the power to restrict their campaign activities. Therefore the Ninth Amendment confers the right to these activities because they are thus retained by the people. The Court ruled against the UPW and upheld Congress' authority under the Constitution to legislate as they did. <u>The Ninth Amendment did not receive a victory in the Supreme Court until 1965 by way of</u> the <u>Griswold</u> v. Connecticut case. This case challenged a Connecticut law that prohibited the use of any medicines or instruments to prevent pregnancy. Estelle Griswold was the Executive Director of the Connecticut Planned Parenthood and her branch opened a birth control center. The Supreme Court ruled by a 7-2 margin that this law violated marital privacy. They used the Ninth Amendment as the direct basis for recognizing this implicit right. They extended this right to unmarried couples in the 1972 Eisenstadt v. Baird case. In 1973 the Supreme Court used this ""Right to Privacy"" and extended it while helping to decide the Roe v. Wade abortion case. Unfortunately the Court decided to use the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause as its primary citation. The lower district court had used the Ninth Amendment as their primary justification for allowing women to have abortions if they chose to because they had a right to privacy. <u>The Ninth Amendment has only been used in supporting roles since this decision. The current makeup of the Supreme Court is much more conservative than in the recent past. It is thus very unlikely to consider most or any Ninth Amendment arguments</u>. The reason for this is that this amendment does not explicitly name any particular rights. Most conservative justices are anathema to citing this amendment in their decisions for that reason. <u>The Ninth Amendment clearly has a thin history in regards to Supreme Court cases</u>. Privacy rights are the only rights that the Court has been willing to extrapolate from it. Even then they needed support from other amendments. The current conservative Supreme Court will most likely never use the Ninth Amendment or any others to recognize other implicit Constitutional rights. <u><strong><mark>A more progressive Supreme Court </mark>will be <mark>need</mark>ed</u></strong> for that. What should <u>a more progressive Court</u> look to do in regards to using the Ninth Amendment to recognize other rights? I believe they <u>should<mark> look to </mark>identifying the <mark>essential life sustaining rights of all people</u>. <u><strong>One that immediately comes to mind is healthcare</u></strong></mark>. The Healthcare industry is no longer the basic and inexpensive profession of previous generations. Drug development costs, complex and expensive diagnostic medical equipment, and expensive hospital expenses are among the many factors that have dramatically ballooned the size of medical bills. Most American citizens cannot afford proper healthcare if left on their own to purchase it. This is due to the massive cost. Currently <u>most people receive their healthcare insurance through their employer.</u> The elderly receive it through the government by way of Medicare. <u>Americans who are not employed or elderly have no access to affordable healthcare insurance</u>. This is because they do not have the benefit of access to pooled insurance that spreads risk. <u>The result is that <mark>most unemployed Americans go without this vital need because they cannot afford the insurance</u></mark>. I submit that this condition is cruel, inhumane, and unfair. I propose that <u>National <mark>Healthcare Insurance</u></mark> should be <u><mark>mandatory for all Americans because</u></mark> it <u><strong><mark>is an implied right that can be derived from the Ninth Amendment</u></strong></mark>. <u><mark>Medical care is</mark> almost <mark>as necessary to human existence as </mark>food and <mark>water</u></mark>. <u><mark>How can we</mark> in all good conscience effectively <mark>deprive</mark> many <mark>Americans of this essential life sustaining service</mark>?</u> I say that <u><strong><mark>we</mark> should not and <mark>cannot</u></strong></mark>. My belief is <u>just as privacy rights have been upheld as implicit by the Supreme Court <mark>by way of the Ninth Amendment</mark>, so <mark>should essential human needs such as affordable healthcare be upheld as implicit rights</u></mark>. James Madison could never have imagined healthcare becoming as expensive as it is now and thus becoming an urgent need and perhaps even a right. That is why Madison created the Ninth Amendment. He knew that the eight amendments that he wrote for the first Congress could never encompass all rights that citizens are entitled to. This was as true for that time with its less complex issues and technology as it is now. The Founding Fathers probably felt that privacy rights were implicit within the Fourth Amendment. Unfortunately this was only partly true and only in regards to unreasonable searches. Thus the Supreme Court extended it to privacy by way of the Ninth and Fourteenth Amendments. Why not use the Ninth Amendment for a right to affordable healthcare and other life sustaining needs? I know this is an unconventional and most likely controversial view. Most worthwhile ideas start out that way. I believe <u><mark>it is</u></mark> about <u><mark>time we</mark> started <mark>consider</mark>ing <mark>the Ninth</mark> Amendment more <mark>broadly to protect American citizens from the deprivation of life sustaining needs and rights</u></mark>. Our economic system has become an increasingly cruel and unequal system that casts its unfortunate citizens outside the system to make do for themselves. I believe <u><mark>it is</mark> now <mark>time to become innovative to correct</u></mark> these <u><mark>injustices.</u> <u><strong>The Ninth Amendment is my prime tool to facilitate this</u></strong></mark>. The neglect of this wise and ingenious amendment should end now. <u>We need to put it to proper use to protect all of our fellow Americans</u>.</p>",1AC,,1AC Advantage 2,436231,1,17667,./documents/ndtceda14/Georgia/FeBo/Georgia-Feinberg-Boyce-Aff-Ndt-Round5.docx,566341,A,Ndt,5,Michigan State Caporal-Zemel,"Gannon, Hennigan, Moczulski","1AC

758909,Economic growth is vital for Canadian military investments in the Arctic – that prevents global conflict,Dobransky 12,"Dobransky 12 (Steve, Adjunct Prof of PoliSci @ Cleveland State, ""Military Security, Energy Resources, and the Emergence of the Northwest Passage: Canada’s Arctic Dilemma,"" http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0106/ca/dobransky_arctic.html)",there is no indication that Canada’s economy will greatly expand in the foreseeable future to produce the necessary surplus wealth to pay for a sizeable increase in an Arctic force If Canada is unwilling to shift or produce enough resources to create a sufficient Arctic force then it opens up the possibility that other forces outside the region may move in and claim the trillions of dollars in natural resources. Russia is an obvious pursuer. The U.S. is another option. China will be looking The Arctic is increasingly looking like the grounds for a potential rivalry one can only imagine how aggressively countries will act The massive amount of resources in the Arctic are there for the taking unless Canada is willing to make significant sacrifices to secure the area The Russians are expanding rapidly in the Arctic region the greatest threat to U.S. interests in the Arctic may be Canada’s inability or unwillingness to develop an adequate security plan and force in the Arctic this growing threat could set off a major race by other countries into the Arctic to establish economic and territorial claims and may lead to serious conflict,Canada’s economy will greatly expand to produce the necessary surplus wealth to pay for increase in Arctic force. If Canada is unwilling opens up the possibility that other forces move in Russia The U.S China The Arctic is grounds for rivalry the greatest threat to U.S. interests may be Canada’s inability a major race may lead to serious conflict,"If Canada is to achieve its territorial and diplomatic ambitions, then it likely requires a much greater civilian and military presence in the Arctic all year-round. Yet, there is no indication that Canadians are willing to sacrifice their current social system of extensive benefits for a much larger military budget and Arctic force. And, there is no evidence that Canadians want to pay much more in taxes or commit to a military draft. Canada has only around 70,000 active-duty military personnel, 30,000 reserve forces, and a $20 billion/year military budget. Its Arctic-ready forces and equipment are just a handful, a few thousand personnel at best who are truly specialists, mainly the Canadian Rangers. Moreover, there is no indication that Canada’s economy will greatly expand in the foreseeable future to produce the necessary surplus wealth to pay for a sizeable increase in an Arctic force. Canada’s economic growth has not been great over the last decade, let alone ever. Thus, Canada presents a very vocal case for the Arctic but has been unable to completely back up its claims with the necessary increases in personnel, materials, ships, and money, which is very telling for the future. If not by now, then when?17 If Canada is unwilling to shift or produce enough resources to create a sufficient Arctic force that is capable of fully securing the region over the three thousand miles of waterways, plus above and beneath the surface, then it opens up the possibility that other forces outside the region may move in and claim the trillions of dollars in natural resources. Russia is an obvious pursuer. The U.S. is another option. China, with its massively growing need for oil—especially when it runs out of much of its own domestic sources in approximately 10 years—will be looking everywhere for oil opportunities. Any country that can move oil rigs and mining companies into the Arctic area, operate them and maintain them, and have enough forces to possibly defend them will have trillions of reasons to act pro-actively. Hypothetical but quite possible. Can or will Canada defend this entire region on its own? Can or will Canadians risk an all-out war with Russia, China, or some other major power for control over all of the Arctic resources? Is Canada even capable of going into the ring against any of the major powers, especially if and when there is a great need and crisis in energy resources?18 Canada can make many public proclamations and scholarly materials on its claims to the Arctic, but its inability or unwillingness to move aggressively to secure the emerging Arctic region is a signal to all that this could become an open-season area in the near future. The Arctic is increasingly looking like the grounds for a potential rivalry similar to the Western World’s colonization, an Oklahoma land rush, a California gold rush, and of course an Alaskan and Klondike gold rush. Maybe all rolled up into one. There are so many valuable resources in this Arctic area that one can only imagine how aggressively countries will act in the coming years and decades as natural resources become increasingly scarce and they become increasingly desperate for more resources and revenues. The massive amount of resources in the Arctic are there for the taking unless Canada is willing to make significant sacrifices to secure the area. Much greater taxation, a major reduction in social welfare benefits, lower wages, longer work hours, much greater economic production, and a significantly larger military that may require a draft, are all one and together necessary options if Canada is to establish fully a sizeable force to secure the entire Arctic region on its side year-round. Canadians spent years debating whether or not to spend the money for 6-8 ships for the Arctic, which is miniscule but indicative of Canadian priorities and intentions. Much greater resources and sacrifices have to be made. Ironically, Canadians may have to give up being Canadian and become more like Americans in order to make and implement the necessary policy changes and play successfully the game of power politics. So far, most Canadians do not appear willing to give up most of what it is to be Canadian. But, will this change in the future?19 Canadians can hope that other countries do not eventually move into the Arctic region, but it appears increasingly obvious that Canadians are passing the torch and initiative to other countries to make the final decision. Canadians, of course, will reject this but the lack of major action and investment in the Arctic region over the past several decades suggest that Canada’s claims to the region rests more on political and legal talk than real power and action. There has been no indication for the last several years in which the Arctic is now being freely traversed year-round that Canadians have changed in any significant way. If Canadians have chosen to rest their claims on the hope that other countries in the future will sacrifice their wealth, power, and standard of living, let alone trillions of dollars in economic opportunities, just on their own goodwill or moral conscience, then it would be a truly dangerous gamble for Canadians. But, in the end, if Canadians are not willing to make the major sacrifices to protect the Arctic and all of its resources, then it is their free choice. Other countries will take note and act accordingly when the time is right and the imperative arises. Power usually trumps legal arguments and paper trails. The Arctic may be the quintessential example in the future.20 The U.S. Perspective and Future Interests and Policy The United States may sooner or later come to the official recognition that Canada does not appear willing to commit the necessary resources to maintain adequate security in the Arctic. It may already have done so, unofficially. The U.S. has maintained some strategic forces in the region, mainly submarines, but the U.S. has yet to make anywhere near the aggressive moves and forces as Russia. The U.S. does not have a modern fleet of Arctic icebreakers, but it certainly has the capability to build one. The Russians are expanding rapidly in the Arctic region in terms of claims, exploration, and slowly but surely oil and mining activities. The U.S. must soon determine its policy on this matter or else the Russians may make the decision for it. The U.S. has worked with Canada on joint security throughout the Cold War, mainly through NORAD and the multiple layers of radar across Canada up to the Arctic. Both the U.S. and Canada have laid down many sonar devices as well. The primary threats to both countries for much of the last half century have been Russian submarines, bombers, and ICBMs. There is less of a threat now with the end of the Cold War, but the security issue remains and could emerge again in the near future.21 The existing international security and energy situations are precarious. Any Middle East crisis that cuts off significant amounts of oil will lead many countries to desperately search for new oil reserves to quickly replenish their lost ones. How long the Arctic will remain off the front stage of world affairs is a question that may be answered sooner rather than later. In the future, the greatest threat to U.S. interests in the Arctic may be Canada’s inability or unwillingness to develop an adequate security plan and force to the emerging economic opportunities in the Arctic. The U.S. does not recognize Canada’s claim to the waterways and, thus, cannot establish an official joint security program in areas in which it does not recognize Canadian sovereignty. Canada cannot do this as well without a major diplomatic backlash by the U.S. and others. Neither side can maintain a fiction for long without having the other renounce its claims and oppose its policy. Thus, strategic threats to North America above and below the Arctic may continue to be addressed jointly by the U.S. and Canada through NORAD and other existing security bodies, but the emerging economic opportunities and subsequent security threats have yet to lead to a plausible joint policy program or organization. This, in the end, may require multinational negotiations or bilateral and individual actions vis-à-vis other countries outside the area. But, this likely will be a very weak and limited policy option with highly questionable results. The U.S. needs to address this growing threat with Canada, the international community, and its own energy and mining corporations. There must be a multiple-track approach of trying to establish an international convention on the Arctic, possibly similar to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, and trying to ensure the U.S.’s future energy needs to sustain its growing and modern society. But, Canada’s adamant claims to the Arctic may undermine this possible convention because it presupposes international waterways and not Canadian sovereignty. On the other hand, the U.S. may have to be prepared to go it alone and open up the way for its own companies to move in and exploit the area for its own best interests as well as to prevent other countries from doing so. This would be preemptive action on the U.S.’s part. And, it would give American companies trillions of new opportunities, as well as give the U.S. more than enough oil to last for several more decades if not to the end of the century. But, this could set off a major race by other countries into the Arctic to establish economic and territorial claims and this may lead to serious conflict. Thus, an Arctic Regime seems imperative. Yet, any one country, especially a minor one, claiming sole possession over approximately half of the Arctic appears to be a non-starter or game breaker. The U.S. expects equal and free access to much of the Arctic. Canada, therefore, appears to be the primary obstacle in the U.S.’s eyes to the creation of any future Arctic Regime.22",9930.0,"<h4>Economic growth is vital for Canadian military investments in the Arctic – that prevents global conflict </h4><p><u><strong>Dobransky 12</u></strong> (Steve, Adjunct Prof of PoliSci @ Cleveland State, ""Military Security, Energy Resources, and the Emergence of the Northwest Passage: Canada’s Arctic Dilemma,"" http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0106/ca/dobransky_arctic.html)</p><p>If Canada is to achieve its territorial and diplomatic ambitions, then it likely requires a much greater civilian and military presence in the Arctic all year-round.

Is Canada even capable of going into the ring against any of the major powers, especially if and when there is a great need and crisis in energy resources?18 Canada can make many public proclamations and scholarly materials on its claims to the Arctic, but its inability or unwillingness to move aggressively to secure the emerging Arctic region is a signal to all that this could become an open-season area in the near future. The Arctic is increasingly looking like the grounds for a potential rivalry similar to the Western World’s colonization, an Oklahoma land rush, a California gold rush, and of course an Alaskan and Klondike gold rush. Maybe all rolled up into one. There are so many valuable resources in this Arctic area that one can only imagine how aggressively countries will act in the coming years and decades as natural resources become increasingly scarce and they become increasingly desperate for more resources and revenues. The massive amount of resources in the Arctic are there for the taking unless Canada is willing to make significant sacrifices to secure the area. Much greater taxation, a major reduction in social welfare benefits, lower wages, longer work hours, much greater economic production, and a significantly larger military that may require a draft, are all one and together necessary options if Canada is to establish fully a sizeable force to secure the entire Arctic region on its side year-round. Canadians spent years debating whether or not to spend the money for 6-8 ships for the Arctic, which is miniscule but indicative of Canadian priorities and intentions. Much greater resources and sacrifices have to be made. Ironically, Canadians may have to give up being Canadian and become more like Americans in order to make and implement the necessary policy changes and play successfully the game of power politics. So far, most Canadians do not appear willing to give up most of what it is to be Canadian. But, will this change in the future?19 Canadians can hope that other countries do not eventually move into the Arctic region, but it appears increasingly obvious that Canadians are passing the torch and initiative to other countries to make the final decision. Canadians, of course, will reject this but the lack of major action and investment in the Arctic region over the past several decades suggest that Canada’s claims to the region rests more on political and legal talk than real power and action. There has been no indication for the last several years in which the Arctic is now being freely traversed year-round that Canadians have changed in any significant way. If Canadians have chosen to rest their claims on the hope that other countries in the future will sacrifice their wealth, power, and standard of living, let alone trillions of dollars in economic opportunities, just on their own goodwill or moral conscience, then it would be a truly dangerous gamble for Canadians. But, in the end, if Canadians are not willing to make the major sacrifices to protect the Arctic and all of its resources, then it is their free choice. Other countries will take note and act accordingly when the time is right and the imperative arises. Power usually trumps legal arguments and paper trails. The Arctic may be the quintessential example in the future.20 The U.S. Perspective and Future Interests and Policy The United States may sooner or later come to the official recognition that Canada does not appear willing to commit the necessary resources to maintain adequate security in the Arctic. It may already have done so, unofficially. The U.S. has maintained some strategic forces in the region, mainly submarines, but the U.S. has yet to make anywhere near the aggressive moves and forces as Russia. The U.S. does not have a modern fleet of Arctic icebreakers, but it certainly has the capability to build one. The Russians are expanding rapidly in the Arctic region in terms of claims, exploration, and slowly but surely oil and mining activities. The U.S. must soon determine its policy on this matter or else the Russians may make the decision for it. The U.S. has worked with Canada on joint security throughout the Cold War, mainly through NORAD and the multiple layers of radar across Canada up to the Arctic. Both the U.S. and Canada have laid down many sonar devices as well. The primary threats to both countries for much of the last half century have been Russian submarines, bombers, and ICBMs. There is less of a threat now with the end of the Cold War, but the security issue remains and could emerge again in the near future.21 The existing international security and energy situations are precarious. Any Middle East crisis that cuts off significant amounts of oil will lead many countries to desperately search for new oil reserves to quickly replenish their lost ones. How long the Arctic will remain off the front stage of world affairs is a question that may be answered sooner rather than later. In the future, the greatest threat to U.S. interests in the Arctic may be Canada’s inability or unwillingness to develop an adequate security plan and force to the emerging economic opportunities in the Arctic. The U.S. does not recognize Canada’s claim to the waterways and, thus, cannot establish an official joint security program in areas in which it does not recognize Canadian sovereignty. Canada cannot do this as well without a major diplomatic backlash by the U.S. and others. Neither side can maintain a fiction for long without having the other renounce its claims and oppose its policy. Thus, strategic threats to North America above and below the Arctic may continue to be addressed jointly by the U.S. and Canada through NORAD and other existing security bodies, but the emerging economic opportunities and subsequent security threats have yet to lead to a plausible joint policy program or organization. This, in the end, may require multinational negotiations or bilateral and individual actions vis-à-vis other countries outside the area. But, this likely will be a very weak and limited policy option with highly questionable results. The U.S. needs to address this growing threat with Canada, the international community, and its own energy and mining corporations. There must be a multiple-track approach of trying to establish an international convention on the Arctic, possibly similar to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959, and trying to ensure the U.S.’s future energy needs to sustain its growing and modern society. But, Canada’s adamant claims to the Arctic may undermine this possible convention because it presupposes international waterways and not Canadian sovereignty. On the other hand, the U.S. may have to be prepared to go it alone and open up the way for its own companies to move in and exploit the area for its own best interests as well as to prevent other countries from doing so. This would be preemptive action on the U.S.’s part. And, it would give American companies trillions of new opportunities, as well as give the U.S. more than enough oil to last for several more decades if not to the end of the century. But, this could set off a major race by other countries into the Arctic to establish economic and territorial claims and this may lead to serious conflict. Thus, an Arctic Regime seems imperative. Yet, any one country, especially a minor one, claiming sole possession over approximately half of the Arctic appears to be a non-starter or game breaker. The U.S. expects equal and free access to much of the Arctic. Canada, therefore, appears to be the primary obstacle in the U.S.’s eyes to the creation of any future Arctic Regime.22",9930.0,"<h4><strong>Economic growth is vital for Canadian military investments in the Arctic – that prevents global conflict </h4><p>Dobransky 12</strong> (Steve, Adjunct Prof of PoliSci @ Cleveland State, ""Military Security, Energy Resources, and the Emergence of the Northwest Passage: Canada’s Arctic Dilemma,"" http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/item/2012/0106/ca/dobransky_arctic.html)</p><p>If Canada is to achieve its territorial and diplomatic ambitions, then it likely requires a much greater civilian and military presence in the Arctic all year-round.

Body and archive: From flash to human database¶ Biopower “made knowledge/power an agent of transformation of human life.”18 Knowledge, phantasies and sensations¶ were not produced only in metropoles but in (relation to) colonies, and are crucial for the colonial order of things. This¶ perspective is necessary if we want to understand what knowledge of a “healthy, vigorous, bourgeois body” was all¶ about19 and how it created conditions for executing authority over life and death. Why and how is the “citizen” always¶ symbolized by a heterosexual (white) man, while “Western” is read as “global” and “universal”? How are the notion¶ and rights of “real” citizens still maintained through the production of the opposed figure of the “alien” (non-normative¶ sexualities, stigmatized as less “human,” “uncivilized,” “imported from the East/West,” as a threat to the “immunity”¶ of population, to its moral and social order, and as such erased from the citizenship), especially if we bear in mind the¶ promises of databases and networked technologies for destabilizing dominant narratives of racial, sexual and class¶ order ?¶ In addressing the memory politics and sexual regimes of archives/databases, we have to ask how it is that early¶ psychoanalysis appears to have nothing to say about race, although it puts sexuality at the center of its analysis.¶ As Brian Carr demonstrates, the “dark margins” of its archive (racial reality in relation to which the gendered white¶ bourgeois subject is “made”), “protect” it from recognizing the racialized boundary that was produced between systematic humanization (the human subject’s “becoming”) and systematic dehumanization (how these subjects are¶ representationaly and symbolically “unmade” – how racialized/colonized “non-subjects” are made). The subaltern¶ is, as Carr argues, a body that is systematically de-signified within a socio-symbolic structure of sexual difference and¶ converted to a dehumanized captive “flash.”20 It seems that it would be possible to be inscribed as “human” (only)¶ through hegemonic modernist (hetero)narrative.¶ Furthermore, the emergence of new forms of historical analysis and its discourse helped nations to set up conditions¶ for conceiving social relations in binary terms.21 It is a discourse, as Stoler summarizes, whose “truth claims are made¶ to specific rights and by specific holders of them; the rights of a family (to property), of a class (to privilege), of a race¶ (to rule).”22 The technology of sexuality (through which the bourgeoisie would claim its privileged position, absolute¶ rights and jurisdictions as to “how to live”), themes of evolutionism and, above all, racism, would together create¶ conditions to make it acceptable to put certain people to death in order to legitimize bio-regulation, the monstrous idea¶ of “superiority” (of a specific gender, race, class) and “purification” for the sake of normalization. The (re)productive¶ family, and “healthy,” “productive” sexuality have been perceived as guaranteeing the welfare of the nation and its¶ citizenry (as morally acceptable and improving of the race), while undisciplined sexuality as a potential threat to both¶ the individual and the population (linking it to natives and “fictive” Europeans).23¶ The affirmation of such a (bourgeois) body, which is worth isolating from others, managing and protecting from¶ numerous dangers through technologies of sex, is a part of the political ordering of life in which human rights are¶ proclaimed universal but applied selectively to those who are perceived as “humans” or good “citizens.” Such citizenship¶ has also been gender-coded (women’s rights being dependent on their rights of sexual and conjugal contracts with¶ men). The archive’s regimes of visibility serve to order and control bodies by inscribing them into and erasing them¶ from humanity and citizenship, granting them and confiscating their civil/human rights.¶ Such technologies privilege populations over individuals and, in a strange way, as Chun recognizes, even release him/¶ her from rights and responsibilities.24 Monstrous ideas of reproductive control on a large scale – through archives and¶ bio-technologies that focus on sexuality, materialized in movements such as “Eugenics” (Greek: “well born”), which¶ privileged a specific population over the individual, focusing on “death” in order to foster life – did not disappear¶ after showing their real face in Nazi labs, but developed in other forms, using the potential of programmability in so called¶ democratic societies. Life/death are thus both objects and objectives. In that way, Eugenics and state racism¶ “became ways of giving the state the power of death” (Chun).25 Today, killings or deaths are presented as acceptable¶ if a proclaimed “threat to humanity” has been eliminated along with them (e.g., in the war on terror, the immunity of¶ the social body, etc.).¶ Eugenics and similar bio-technologies, as Chun shows, were not only in charge of high-speed mass calculations at¶ the level of content, but also at the level of “logic or of operationality”26 and optimization, which returns us to the¶ interweaving of computer /database technology and of biology (through memory and programmability), and of the¶ current state of neoliberal capitalism. Chun argues that the drive for an “independent program that conflates legislation¶ with execution – did not arise solely from within computation, but also from early Mendelian genetics and eugenics,”27¶ which envision a “mechanic understanding of life, in which the human body becomes an archive.”28¶ In addition to these technologies of life, necropolitics is supported by numerous migratory and death technologies.¶ From centralized databases such as Eurodac (The fingerprint database on EU asylum and illegal border-crossers that¶ enables “digital deportability”)29 to drone warfare (capable of identifying and killing the threatening body), different¶ database technologies treat subjects as things deprived of human and citizen rights. There is evident deregulation¶ and lack of attention to any legal boundaries that would regulate the deployment of such surveillance and controlling¶ technologies (issues of privacy, discrimination, principle of limitation, etc.). What is aimed at is standardization of information, usage of all available and collectable data for multiple purposes, centralization and the automation of¶ decision-making. Patterning, profiling a specific type, is increasingly present. These technologies that make bodies¶ legible and establish divisions between citizens and (un)desirable aliens – decisive stigmatizing technologies of inclusion/¶ exclusion that inscribe archive into the body (though biometric data, DNA, age, voice-testing used for registration)¶ that is dehumanized, excluded from the registration of citizenship, deprived of human rights – are not inventions of¶ the digital age but have been developed from earlier bureaucratic handlings of visual documentation. Allan Sekula¶ showed how photography came to inscribe bodies in the archive, to establish the terrain of the Other, and to define¶ “generalized look-typology” for deviance and social pathology (e.g. Galaton’s effort to embed archive in photography,¶ to create a system of typology to control social deviance, or Bertillon’s attempt to embed the photo in the archive to¶ create a system of identification and indexing). The effects of such practices are rarely discussed, although concrete¶ political practices and decisions are determined by the knowledge obtained from these programmed memories and¶ databases.¶ Today, coloniality is digital and none of us has any control of the data or digital traces that are collected about our lives,¶ inscribed into our bodies and exploited for various purposes.¶ Those to whom rights have not been granted are still used in bioinformatics as a source. Their life is privatized and¶ even commercialized, without informing them of the effects or obtaining their permission for usage (e.g. the Human¶ Genome Diversity Project creating a database of up to 8,000 distinct ethnic populations, even patenting their cell lines).¶ Some Patent Offices granted patents to people who claimed to be able to uncover genetic sequences, which would¶ allow them to use these for commercial purposes for “new products.”30¶ Apart from predictions concerning the body’s disappearance and the hype over online technologies, images of bodies¶ are everywhere (surveilled, scanned, captured, tagged, shared, stored for future visions). The Other is continuously¶ recalled, visualized, but only to be instantly erased from the register of humans and citizens. Non-normative sexuality¶ is strategically visualized in and erased from the register through the image of the undisciplined, racialized and¶ dehumanized Other, never through the image of the good “citizen” (or maybe only through the image of the straight¶ “homonationalist” who reproduces its hierarchical ideals and whom the nation is willing to accept).31¶ Although the internet appears as an “unrestrictive colony” where one might look for experiences “unobtainable”¶ at “home” (virtual cross-dressing, unrestrictive sexualities, etc.), “home” is not far away for “whatever beings” (Jodi¶ Dean), with as Kroker notes, its panic at same-sex marriage, fear of gay desire32 and “all the unmourned... violence that¶ is the everyday life experience of women suffering domestic violence and of disappeared sex workers and gays and¶ lesbians.” The system of such power, as Kroker notes, is “haunted by paranoiac fears of revenge by those who have¶ been excluded from the spectacle of consumption”33 and from the Western ethical order of the “human.”",9935.0,"<h4>For each body the 1AC purports to save there is a body dehumanized as inferior.

This¶ perspective is necessary <mark>if we want to understand what knowledge of a “healthy, vigorous, bourgeois body</u></strong>”</mark> was all¶ about19 <u><strong><mark>and how it created conditions for executing authority over life and death</mark>. Why and how is the “citizen” always¶ symbolized by a heterosexual (white) man</u></strong>, while “Western” is read as “global” and “universal”? How are <u><strong><mark>the notion¶ and rights of “real” citizens</mark> </u></strong>still <u><strong><mark>maintained through the production of the opposed figure of the “alien”</mark> </u></strong>(non-normative¶ sexualities, stigmatized as less “human,” “uncivilized,” “imported from the East/West,” as a threat to the “immunity”¶ of population, to its moral and social order, and as such erased from the citizenship), especially if we bear in mind the¶ promises of databases and networked technologies for destabilizing dominant narratives of racial, sexual and class¶ order ?¶ In addressing the memory politics and sexual regimes of archives/databases, we have to ask <u><strong><mark>how it is that early</mark>¶ <mark>psychoanalysis appears to have nothing to say about race</mark>, although it puts sexuality at the center of its analysis.</u></strong>¶ As Brian Carr demonstrates, <u><strong><mark>the “dark margins” of its archive</mark> (racial reality in relation to which the gendered white¶ bourgeois subject is “made”), “<mark>protect” it from recognizing the racialized boundary that was produced between systematic humanization (the human subject’s “becoming”) and systematic dehumanization</mark> (how these subjects are¶ representationaly and symbolically “unmade</u></strong>” – how racialized/colonized “non-subjects” are made). <u><strong><mark>The subaltern</mark>¶ is,</u></strong> as Carr argues, <u><strong>a body that is <mark>systematically de-signified within a socio-symbolic structure of</mark> sexual <mark>difference</mark> and¶ converted to a dehumanized captive “flash</u></strong>.”20 It seems that it would be possible to be inscribed as “human” (only)¶ through hegemonic modernist (hetero)narrative.¶ Furthermore, the emergence of new forms of historical analysis and its discourse helped nations to set up conditions¶ for conceiving social relations in binary terms.21 It is a discourse, as Stoler summarizes, whose “<u><strong>truth claims are made¶ to specific rights and by specific holders of them; the rights of a family (to property), of a class (to privilege), of a race¶ (to rule).</u></strong>”22 The technology of sexuality (through which the bourgeoisie would claim its privileged position, absolute¶ rights and jurisdictions as to “how to live”), <u><strong>themes of evolutionism and</u></strong>, above all, <u><strong>racism, would together create¶ conditions to make it acceptable to put certain people to death in order to legitimize bio-regulation, the monstrous idea¶ of “superiority”</u></strong> (of a specific gender, race, class) and “purification” for the sake of normalization. The (re)productive¶ family, and “healthy,” “productive” sexuality have been perceived as guaranteeing the welfare of the nation and its¶ citizenry (as morally acceptable and improving of the race), while undisciplined sexuality as a potential threat to both¶ the individual and the population (linking it to natives and “fictive” Europeans).23¶ <u><strong><mark>The affirmation of such a (bourgeois) body, which is worth isolating from others, managing and protecting</mark> </u></strong>from¶ numerous dangers through technologies of sex<mark>, <u><strong>is a part of the political ordering of life in which human rights are</mark>¶ <mark>proclaimed universal</mark> but <mark>applied selectively</mark> to those who are perceived as <mark>“humans”</mark> or good “citizens.” Such citizenship¶ has also been gender-coded </u></strong>(women’s rights being dependent on their rights of sexual and conjugal contracts with¶ men). <u><strong><mark>The archive’s regimes of visibility</mark> serve to order and <mark>control bodies</mark> by inscribing them into and erasing them¶ from humanity and citizenship, granting them and confiscating their civil/human rights</u></strong>.¶ Such technologies privilege populations over individuals and, in a strange way, as Chun recognizes, even release him/¶ her from rights and responsibilities.24 <u><strong><mark>Monstrous ideas of reproductive control</mark> </u></strong>on a large scale – <u><strong>thr<mark>ough archives and¶ bio-technologies</mark> that focus on sexuality, materialized in movements such as “Eugenics</u></strong>” (Greek: “well born”), which¶ <u><strong><mark>privileged a specific population over the individual, focusing on “death” in order to foster life</mark> </u></strong>– <u><strong><mark>did not disappear</mark>¶ after showing their real face in Nazi labs, <mark>but developed in other forms</mark>, using the potential of programmability in so called¶ democratic societies</u></strong>. Life/death are thus both objects and objectives. In that way, Eugenics and state racism¶ “became ways of giving the state the power of death” (Chun).25 Today, <u><strong>killings or deaths are presented as acceptable¶ if a proclaimed “threat to humanity” has been eliminated along with them (e.g., in the war on terror, the immunity of¶ the social body, etc.).¶ Eugenics and similar bio-technologies</u></strong>, as Chun shows, <u><strong>were not only in charge of high-speed mass calculations at¶ the level of content, but also at the level of “logic or of operationality</u></strong>”<u><strong>26 and optimization, which returns us to the¶ interweaving of computer /database technology and of biology (through memory and programmability), and of <mark>the¶ current state of neoliberal capitalism</u></strong></mark>. Chun argues that the drive for an “independent program that conflates legislation¶ with execution – did not arise solely from within computation, but also from early Mendelian <u><strong>genetics and eugenics</u></strong>,”27¶ which <u><strong><mark>envision a “mechanic understanding of life, in which the human body becomes an archive</mark>.”</u></strong>28¶ In addition to these technologies of life, <u><strong>necropolitics is supported by numerous migratory and death technologies.¶ </u></strong>From centralized databases such as Eurodac (The fingerprint database on EU asylum and illegal border-crossers that¶ enables “digital deportability”)29 to drone warfare (capable of identifying and killing the threatening body), <u><strong>different¶ database technologies treat subjects as things deprived of human and citizen rights</u></strong>. There is evident deregulation¶ and lack of attention to any legal boundaries that would regulate the deployment of such surveillance and controlling¶ technologies (issues of privacy, discrimination, principle of limitation, etc.). <u><strong>What is aimed at is standardization of information, usage of all available and collectable data for multiple purposes, centralization and the automation of¶ decision-making. Patterning, profiling a specific type, is increasingly present. These technologies that make bodies¶ legible and establish divisions between citizens and (un)desirable aliens – decisive stigmatizing technologies of inclusion/¶ exclusion that inscribe archive into the body (though biometric data, DNA, age</u></strong>, voice-testing used for registration)¶ that is dehumanized, excluded from the registration of citizenship, deprived of human rights – are not inventions of¶ the digital age but have been developed from earlier bureaucratic handlings of visual documentation. Allan Sekula¶ showed how photography came to inscribe bodies in the archive, to establish the terrain of the Other, and to define¶ “generalized look-typology” for deviance and social pathology (e.g. Galaton’s effort to embed archive in photography,¶ to create a system of typology to control social deviance, or Bertillon’s attempt to embed the photo in the archive to¶ create a system of identification and indexing). <u><strong>The effects of such practices are rarely discussed, although concrete¶ political practices and decisions are determined by the knowledge obtained from these programmed memories and¶ databases.</u></strong>¶ Today, coloniality is digital and none of us has any control of the data or digital traces that are collected about our lives,¶ inscribed into our bodies and exploited for various purposes.¶ <u><strong>Those to whom rights have not been granted are still used in bioinformatics as a source. Their life is privatized and¶ even commercialized, without informing them of the effects or obtaining their permission for usage</u></strong> (<u><strong>e.g. the Human¶ Genome Diversity Project</u></strong> creating a database of up to 8,000 distinct ethnic populations, even patenting their cell lines).¶ <u><strong>Some Patent Offices granted patents to people who claimed to be able to uncover genetic sequences, which would¶ allow them to use these for commercial purposes for “new products</u></strong>.”30¶ Apart from predictions concerning the body’s disappearance and the hype over online technologies, <u><strong><mark>images of bodies</mark>¶ <mark>are everywhere</u></strong></mark> (surveilled, scanned, captured, tagged, shared, stored for future visions). <u><strong><mark>The Other is continuously</mark>¶ recalled, <mark>visualized,</mark> but only <mark>to be</mark> instantly <mark>erased from the register of humans and citizens</u></strong></mark>. Non-normative sexuality¶ is strategically visualized in and erased from the register through the image of the undisciplined, racialized and¶ dehumanized Other, never through the image of the good “citizen” (or maybe only through the image of the straight¶ “homonationalist” who reproduces its hierarchical ideals and whom the nation is willing to accept).31¶ Although the internet appears as an “unrestrictive colony” where one might look for experiences “unobtainable”¶ at “home” (virtual cross-dressing, unrestrictive sexualities, etc.), <u><strong>“home” is not far away for “whatever beings”</u></strong> (Jodi¶ Dean), with as Kroker notes, its panic at same-sex marriage, fear of gay desire32 and “a<u><strong>l</u></strong>l the unmourned... violence that¶ is the everyday life experience of women suffering domestic violence and of disappeared sex workers and gays and¶ lesbians.” <u><strong><mark>The system of</mark> such <mark>power</u></strong></mark>, as Kroker notes<u><strong>, <mark>is “haunted by paranoiac fears of revenge by those who have</mark>¶ <mark>been excluded from the spectacle of consumption</mark>”</u></strong>33 <u><strong>and from the Western ethical order of the “human.”</p></u></strong>",,,Case,437801,1,17758,./documents/ndtceda14/Gonzaga/WeSk/Gonzaga-Weinhardt-Skoog-Neg-Ndt-Round1.docx,566581,N,Ndt,1,Nevada Las Vegas Gomez-Velto,"Arsht, Gramzinski, Symonds","Aff - Organs

That panel is scheduled to deliver a final report sometime over the coming weeks.¶ But while advocates say that everyone agrees an end to AIDS is a worthwhile achievement, some of the ideas contained in the yet-to-be-released report from the task force may be a hard sell in Albany, where new dollars for health initiatives can be scarce.¶ And the task force, made up of 63 different people representing all areas of the state, is trying to go beyond its mandate, not just reducing the number of new infections below the threshold necessary to qualify as an epidemic, but virtually eradicating the disease, as well as the stigma that goes along with it.¶ That is easier said than done, said Charles King, the president and C.E.O. of Housing Works and a co-chair of the Ending AIDS task force.¶ One of the central pieces of the report the task force will release in the coming weeks is a call to pass GENDA, the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act. This bill, which would prohibit discrimination against transgender New Yorkers, has passed multiple times in the state Assembly, but has yet to be brought for a vote in the Republican-held State Senate.¶ Transgender New Yorkers, along with poor, young Latinos and black men who have sex with other men, are among the populations most at risk for contracting H.I.V. and AIDS, King said. Infection rates among all other populations of New Yorkers have been steadily decreasing over at least the past two decades. In 1993, 15,000 New Yorkers were infected with H.I.V. each year, and by 2013, the number of new annual infections had decreased to 3,200. The introduction of drugs like Truvada, the pre-exposure prophylactic drug that can be taken to ward off infection, is expected to help curb new infection rates. But new infection rates have held steady among black and Latino men who have sex with men and transgender people.¶ “We’ve seen the curve of new infections go down among every population, with the exception of younger black and Hispanic gay and bisexual men, where it's still continuing at more or less the same rate of new infections as before,"" King said. ""We also know there’s a huge issue among transgender people, we just don’t have the data.""¶ Passing GENDA would help transgender people feel more comfortable disclosing their sexual practices, and seeking health care, King said.¶ “For transgender folk you’ve got to have an enabling environment, and if it’s still legal to discriminate against transgender people, it’s very hard to create an environment that’s good for them to avoid infection,” King said.¶ Ending the epidemic would be much more difficult wihout GENDA, said Kimberleigh Smith, the vice president of policy advocacy and communications at Harlem United, a nonprofit human service organization providing community based health care and supportive housing.¶ “I’m sure we can get closer without GENDA, but I think passing GENDA is a big part of these recommendations,” Smith said.¶ Two other task force recommendations affect teenage sexual practices, a political landmine in Albany, especially among more conservative lawmakers loath to appear to be condoning permissiveness on sexual behavior.¶ A bill called the Healthy Teens Act would ""require every school across the state, every high school and middle school to teach age-appropriate public health informed sexuality courses,” King said.¶ As of now, the state does mandate every public school provide comprehensive sex education, and decisions on what to teach are made at the district level.¶ Education about lesbian, gay bisexual and transgender sexual practices is key to helping young people at risk of infection understand how to avoid the disease, King said. And some of the state’s most at-risk populations in school have no sexual education. High schools for nontraditional students, over the age of 18, aren’t required to provide sexual education classes, and neither are schools for developmentally disabled students.¶ Another policy change would allow minors, who are already allowed to consent to H.I.V. testing, to consent to receiving treatment or one of the new phrophylactic drug regimens if they become infected.¶ The most difficult proposal to pass among the task force’s recommendations might be a new measure that would provide housing support for homeless and unstably housed H.I.V./AIDS patients outside of New York City. Health officials have long noted the correlation between how stable a person’s housing is and their ability to adhere to a drug treatment regimen. But providing housing for the estimated 4,000 to 6,000 New Yorkers outside of New York City who are H.I.V. infected would cost the state an estimated $100 to $120 million a year, said Mark Harrington executive director of Treatment Action Group (TAG).¶ The AIDS advocates know that anything costly or controversial can be a hard sell in Albany, especially while the Legislature is preoccupied with ethics reforms and looming fights over education and rent regulations. But the task force members say they are encouraged by the governor’s public commitment to the idea of being the first state in the country to end its epidemic, a move being closely watched by other states like Washington and Minnesota, where similar plans to lower new AIDS infections have recently been announced.¶ Cuomo endorsed GENDA in his written budget book this year, the first time he has done so, advocates noted.¶ “I think [Cuomo]’s being looked at, as is New York State across the country, as really at the forefront of this,” said Kimberleigh Smith, of Harlem United.¶ The Cuomo administration released amendments to the state budget last week that added an additional $5 million of funding for AIDS treatment programs, on top of money already committed in the original budget.¶ “What we really want more than anything is we want the governor’s face, on TV, in a room announcing that he’s endorsing this and he’s doing this,"" Harrington said. ""Because yeah, he said it, but people’s attention spans are very short and you know, we want this to be a personal initiative of his.""¶ Housing Works, which has often rallied and fought for budget initiatives through protest action in New York City and Albany, is closer to the levers of power on the ending AIDS initiative than it has been on other issues in recent memory. King was named by Cuomo as the task force’s co-chair, and Housing Works retained Metropolitan Public Strategies, the consulting firm headed by Neal Kwatra, which was also involved in Cuomo’s re-election campaign, to provide help with their efforts to rally support for the task force recommendations in Albany.¶ The task force members said reluctant lawmakers might be persuaded by the economic arguments of a possible end to AIDS in New York.¶ “Other than appealing to their basic underlying humanity ... beyond that, let’s say we prevent 10,000 new infections in the next five years and the lifetime cost of care for an H.I.V. infected person is about $388,000 dollars,” Harrington said. “Overall we’ll save the state over $4 billion dollars by averting those 10,000 infections.""¶ The task force estimated the state would save a total of $5.1 billion by 2020 in averted housing costs and combined savings from not having to treat newly infected patients.¶ “It’s pretty hard not to look at those numbers and think that that’s a pretty substantial gain to the state taxpayers, not to mention all the lives that you’ve saved,” Harrington said.¶ King said the advocates understood the biggest pressure on reluctant lawmakers could be the governor, who can be remarkably persuasive for the right cause.¶ “It’s more a question of, is the governor, who has very complicated and weighty issues on his plate—he wants to get ethics reform through, he’s driving a school agenda that he wants to get through, you know—in the middle of driving all those things, is he going to be willing to put the political capital behind issues like transgender rights, like sex ed in the schools and children having the right to consent?” King asked.¶ “It’s a question of bandwidth, and it’s a question of investing political capital. And so I’m hopeful that the governor with a lot of encouragement from activists and from the task force is going to do the right thing on all of these things, but I think it's really incumbent that we continue to encourage him,” King said.¶ The goal of ending the epidemic seemed remarkably within reach, Harrington noted.¶ “Having worked with New Yorkers fighting AIDS for the last 35 years, this is one of the most exciting periods in our work together because we’re finally beginning to see the pieces come together for an endgame. And if we can do it here, we can try to scale it and adapt it to any other part of the world,” he said. “Going from something that was once considered to be a universal death sentence and people didn't even want to talk about it to thinking about the endgame, it’s a really exciting period to be doing this work in. We’re really hoping the governor is going to help us cross the finish line.”",9977.0,"<h4><u><strong>New York Governor Cuomo’s measures to end the HIV/AIDs epidemic will pass now, but his political capital is key—it’s modeled globally</h4><p>Nahmias 2-25</p><p></u></strong>Laura Nahmias, political reporter, Feb. 25, 2015, Capital New York, “Cuomo task force pushes him on AIDS goal” http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/albany/2015/02/8562832/cuomo-task-force-pushes-him-aids-goal</p><p>ALBANY—<u><strong>A task force set up by Governor </u></strong>Andrew <u><strong>Cuomo to recommend ways the state can eliminate AIDS as an epidemic in New York within five years is hoping it can convince the governor and the Legislature to go even further</u></strong>.¶ The task force is planning <u><strong><mark>a series of recommendations</u></strong></mark> that its members say <u><strong><mark>will reduce the number of new infections</mark> statewide almost <mark>to zero</u></strong></mark>, while ending the stigma that goes along with the disease.¶ Cuomo announced in June 2014 that he would seek to end AIDS as an epidemic statewide, reducing the number of new H.I.V./AIDS infections each year below the number of annual deaths from the disease.¶ That plan would mean the state’s new infection rate would have to drop from about 3,000 new cases each year to roughly 750.¶ After Cuomo announced the plan last summer, he said he would empanel a task force to develop a blueprint for how the goal could be achieved within five years.

And <u><strong><mark>if we can do it here, we can try to scale it and adapt it to any other part of the world</u></strong></mark>,” he said. “Going from something that was once considered to be a universal death sentence and people didn't even want to talk about it to thinking about the endgame, it’s a really exciting period to be doing this work in.

The potentiality of whiteness—the proleptic call of white anti-racist consciousness— is nothing more than the fiat of an ahistorical dream. A command ushered before thought engages racism, before awareness of the world becomes aware of what is actual. This is forced upon accounts of racism where whiteness is morally obscured from being seen as is. [w]hiteness as is partly determined by what could be, since what is was a past potentiality—a could be. The appeal to the sentimentality, morality, the moral abstraction/distraction of equality—both as a political command and its anthropological requisite—complicate the most obvious consequence of anti-Black racism, namely violence. This moral apriorism urges the Black thinker to conceptualize racism as an activist project rooted in the potential of a world filled with non-racists, a world where the white racist is transformed by Black activity into the white anti-racist. But this project
supposes an erroneous view of the white racist which occludes the reality of white supremacy and anti-Black racism. As Robert F. Williams argues in Negroes with Guns, “the racist is a man crazed by hysteria at the idea of coming into equal contact with Negroes. And this mass mental illness called racism is very much a part of the ‘American way of Life.’” The white racist is not seen as the delusional individual ostracized from society as a result of their abhorrent social pathologies of racist hate. Rather the white racist is normal—the extended family, the spouse, the sibling, the friend of the white individual—the very same entities upon which the inter/intrasubjectivity nexus of the white self is founded. The white [he] experiences no punishment for his longing for Black servitude and his need to exploit and divest the Black worker here and then of [his] wealth. The white [she] has no uneasiness about her raping of—the destruction of generations of Black selves—mothers, children, and men—and today usurps the historical imagery of “the nigger,” to politically vacate Blackness and demonize niggers as beyond political consideration. She rewrites history, pens morality, and embodies the post-racial civil rights subject. As such, racism, the milieu of the white racist is not the exposed pathological existence of the white race, but rather valorized in white individuality, the individuality that conceptualizes their racism as a normative aspiration of what the world should look like, and even more damning, an aspiration that can be supported and propagated in the world. The white racist recognizes the deliberateness of the structures, relations, and systems in a white supremacist society and seeks like their colonial foreparents to claim them as their own Traditionally we have taken ethics to be, as Henry Sidgwick’s claims, ""any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought'—or what is right for them—or to seek to realize by voluntary action.” This rational procedure is however at odds with the empirical reality the ethical deliberation must concern itself with. To argue, as is often done, that the government, its citizens, or white people should act justly, assumes that the possibility of how they could act defines their moral disposition. If a white person could possibly not be racist, it does not mean that the possibility of not being racist, can be taken to mean that they are not racist. In ethical deliberations dealing with the problem of racism, it is common practice to attribute to historically racist institutions, and individuals universal moral qualities that have yet to be demonstrated. This abstraction from reality is what frames our ethical norms and allows us to maintain, despite history or evidence, that racist entities will act justly given the choice. Under such complexities, the only ethical deliberation concerning racism must be anti-ethical, or a judgment refusing to write morality onto immoral entities. In the post-structuralist era, post-colonial thinking about racism specifically, and difference/otherness generally, has given a peculiar ameliorative function to discourse and the performance of “other-ed” identities. In this era, the dominant illusion is that discourse itself , an act that requires as its basis the recognition of the “other” as “similar,” is socially transformative—not only with regard to how the white subject assimilates the similitude of the “other-ed,” but as an actual activity gauged by the recognition by one white person or by a group of white people in any given scenario, is uncritically accepted and encouraged as anti-racist politics.. In actuality such discourse appeals, which necessitate—become dependent on—(white) recognition, function very much like the racial stereotype, in that the concept of the Black body being the expression and source of experience and phenomena (existential-phenomenological-theorization) is incarcerated by the conceptualization created the discursive catalyst yearning to be perceived by the white thing seeing the Black. Such appeals lend potentiality-hope-faith to the already present/demonstrated ignorance-racism-interest of the white individual, who in large part expresses the historical tone/epistemology of their racial group’s interest. When morality is defined, not by the empirical acts that demonstrate immorality, but the racial character of those in question, our ethics become nothing more than the apologetics of our tyrannical epoch. Ought implies a projected (futural) act. The word commands a deliberate action to reasonably expect the world to be able to sustain or support. For the Black thinker, the Black citizen-subject-slave-(in)human, ought is not rational but repressive. For the oppressed racialized thinker, the ethical provocation is an immediate confrontation with the impossibility of actually acting towards values like freedom, liberty, humanity, and life, since none of these values can be achieved concretely for the Black in a world controlled by and framed by the white. The options for ethical actions are not ethical in and of themselves, but merely the options the immorality of the racist world will allow, thus the oppressed is forced to idealize their ethical positions, eliminating the truth of their reality, and the peeling away the tyranny of white bodies, so that as the oppressed, the can ideally imagine an “if condition,” whereby they are allowed to ethical engage racism from the perspective of: “if whites were moral and respected the humanity of Blacks, then we can ethically engage in these behaviors. Unfortunately, this ought constraint only forces Blacks to consciously recognize the futility of ethical engagement, since it is in this ought deliberation that they recognize that their cognition of all values are dependent not on their moral aspirations for the world, but the determined by the will of white supremacy to maintain virtue throughout all ethical calculations. In short, Black ethical deliberation is censored so that it can only engage moral questions by asserting that whites are virtuous and hence capable of being ethically persuaded towards right action, hence all ethical question about racism, white supremacy and anti-Blackness is not about how Blacks think about the world, but what possibility the world allows Blacks to contemplate under the idea of ethics. These ethics, the ethics that result from this vitiated morality, are not arbiters of oppression at all. They are not a rational calculus that is capable of revealing a categorical imperative, rather they function as the Kantian constraints upon human experience; the synthetic apriori upon which the phenomena of whiteness is the landscape of thinking about Blackness under the Western anthropos. There is an implicit appeal to a hierarchy of being that is both empirical and universal—all man is superior to non-man. Hence, ethics emerges as the product of the overrepresentation of Western man thinking itself—projecting itself—into the future. These ethics, theorized away from the anti-Blackness not within it, only uphold an overdetermined virtue of whiteness. They hold within them no actual delineation between good or bad, only a Puritanical call to reason to turn its attention towards the other-ed created. This attention however relies on the perceptions and caricatures of Black torment that appeal to the whites’ self-assuring imagining of themselves, so that even when confronted with racism and their role as whites thinking about Black people incarcerated within a racist society and dying, these whites can claim that their conceptualization of racism itself, or (inter-sectionally) next to other injustices like poverty, sexism, homophobia, etc. makes them (whites) virtuous. It is the process of, the appeal to, “getting whites to recognize” (racist) oppression that allows the destruction of reality, Black death, to continue unabated, since it is the exact moment that whites are forced to engage racist problems in America, be it the anti-Black violence of American society, which animates the aversion of the justice system, the police state, the white citizenry, or the practice of American democracy itself—where the death of Black people/criminals/deviants/thugs remain normal and justified by whites—that they, the white(s) thinking about racism, get to impose upon Black reality, a racist moral maxim, namely that racism is not death and beyond –the end of – ethical calculus or moral evaluation, but ultimately contingent in America and of measurable consequence so much so that must be weighed next to the other democratic values that preserve this great white society: security, safety, individuality, property, profit, and freedom, the very values that when enacted by whites continue to perpetuate one ultimate end, the death of Blacks",9981.0,"<h4>2. <strong>Radically refuse their narcisstic valorization of their own ability to save minorities</h4><p>Curry, Southern Illinois philosophy professor, 2013</p><p><u>(Tommy, “In the Fiat of Dreams: The Delusional Allure of Hope, the Reality of Anti-Black Violence and the Demands of the Anti-Ethical”, Academia.edu)</p><p><mark>The potentiality of whiteness—the proleptic call of white anti-racist consciousness— is</mark> nothing more than the <mark>fiat of an ahistorical dream.</u></strong></mark> A command ushered before thought engages racism, before awareness of the world becomes aware of what is actual.

The potentiality of whiteness—the proleptic call of white anti-racist consciousness— is nothing more than the fiat of an ahistorical dream. A command ushered before thought engages racism, before awareness of the world becomes aware of what is actual. This is forced upon accounts of racism where whiteness is morally obscured from being seen as is. [w]hiteness as is partly determined by what could be, since what is was a past potentiality—a could be. The appeal to the sentimentality, morality, the moral abstraction/distraction of equality—both as a political command and its anthropological requisite—complicate the most obvious consequence of anti-Black racism, namely violence. This moral apriorism urges the Black thinker to conceptualize racism as an activist project rooted in the potential of a world filled with non-racists, a world where the white racist is transformed by Black activity into the white anti-racist. But this project supposes an erroneous view of the white racist which occludes the reality of white supremacy and anti-Black racism. As Robert F. Williams argues in Negroes with Guns, “the racist is a man crazed by hysteria at the idea of coming into equal contact with Negroes. And this mass mental illness called racism is very much a part of the ‘American way of Life.’” The white racist is not seen as the delusional individual ostracized from society as a result of their abhorrent social pathologies of racist hate. Rather the white racist is normal—the extended family, the spouse, the sibling, the friend of the white individual—the very same entities upon which the inter/intrasubjectivity nexus of the white self is founded. The white [he] experiences no punishment for his longing for Black servitude and his need to exploit and divest the Black worker here and then of [his] wealth. The white [she] has no uneasiness about her raping of—the destruction of generations of Black selves—mothers, children, and men—and today usurps the historical imagery of “the nigger,” to politically vacate Blackness and demonize niggers as beyond political consideration. She rewrites history, pens morality, and embodies the post-racial civil rights subject. As such, racism, the milieu of the white racist is not the exposed pathological existence of the white race, but rather valorized in white individuality, the individuality that conceptualizes their racism as a normative aspiration of what the world should look like, and even more damning, an aspiration that can be supported and propagated in the world. The white racist recognizes the deliberateness of the structures, relations, and systems in a white supremacist society and seeks like their colonial foreparents to claim them as their own Traditionally we have taken ethics to be, as Henry Sidgwick’s claims, ""any rational procedure by which we determine what individual human beings 'ought'—or what is right for them—or to seek to realize by voluntary action.” This rational procedure is however at odds with the empirical reality the ethical deliberation must concern itself with. To argue, as is often done, that the government, its citizens, or white people should act justly, assumes that the possibility of how they could act defines their moral disposition. If a white person could possibly not be racist, it does not mean that the possibility of not being racist, can be taken to mean that they are not racist. In ethical deliberations dealing with the problem of racism, it is common practice to attribute to historically racist institutions, and individuals universal moral qualities that have yet to be demonstrated. This abstraction from reality is what frames our ethical norms and allows us to maintain, despite history or evidence, that racist entities will act justly given the choice. Under such complexities, the only ethical deliberation concerning racism must be anti-ethical, or a judgment refusing to write morality onto immoral entities. In the post-structuralist era, post-colonial thinking about racism specifically, and difference/otherness generally, has given a peculiar ameliorative function to discourse and the performance of “other-ed” identities. In this era, the dominant illusion is that discourse itself , an act that requires as its basis the recognition of the “other” as “similar,” is socially transformative—not only with regard to how the white subject assimilates the similitude of the “other-ed,” but as an actual activity gauged by the recognition by one white person or by a group of white people in any given scenario, is uncritically accepted and encouraged as anti-racist politics.. In actuality such discourse appeals, which necessitate—become dependent on—(white) recognition, function very much like the racial stereotype, in that the concept of the Black body being the expression and source of experience and phenomena (existential-phenomenological-theorization) is incarcerated by the conceptualization created the discursive catalyst yearning to be perceived by the white thing seeing the Black. Such appeals lend potentiality-hope-faith to the already present/demonstrated ignorance-racism-interest of the white individual, who in large part expresses the historical tone/epistemology of their racial group’s interest. When morality is defined, not by the empirical acts that demonstrate immorality, but the racial character of those in question, our ethics become nothing more than the apologetics of our tyrannical epoch. Ought implies a projected (futural) act. The word commands a deliberate action to reasonably expect the world to be able to sustain or support. For the Black thinker, the Black citizen-subject-slave-(in)human, ought is not rational but repressive. For the oppressed racialized thinker, the ethical provocation is an immediate confrontation with the impossibility of actually acting towards values like freedom, liberty, humanity, and life, since none of these values can be achieved concretely for the Black in a world controlled by and framed by the white. The options for ethical actions are not ethical in and of themselves, but merely the options the immorality of the racist world will allow, thus the oppressed is forced to idealize their ethical positions, eliminating the truth of their reality, and the peeling away the tyranny of white bodies, so that as the oppressed, the can ideally imagine an “if condition,” whereby they are allowed to ethical engage racism from the perspective of: “if whites were moral and respected the humanity of Blacks, then we can ethically engage in these behaviors. Unfortunately, this ought constraint only forces Blacks to consciously recognize the futility of ethical engagement, since it is in this ought deliberation that they recognize that their cognition of all values are dependent not on their moral aspirations for the world, but the determined by the will of white supremacy to maintain virtue throughout all ethical calculations. In short, Black ethical deliberation is censored so that it can only engage moral questions by asserting that whites are virtuous and hence capable of being ethically persuaded towards right action, hence all ethical question about racism, white supremacy and anti-Blackness is not about how Blacks think about the world, but what possibility the world allows Blacks to contemplate under the idea of ethics. These ethics, the ethics that result from this vitiated morality, are not arbiters of oppression at all. They are not a rational calculus that is capable of revealing a categorical imperative, rather they function as the Kantian constraints upon human experience; the synthetic apriori upon which the phenomena of whiteness is the landscape of thinking about Blackness under the Western anthropos. There is an implicit appeal to a hierarchy of being that is both empirical and universal—all man is superior to non-man. Hence, ethics emerges as the product of the overrepresentation of Western man thinking itself—projecting itself—into the future. These ethics, theorized away from the anti-Blackness not within it, only uphold an overdetermined virtue of whiteness. They hold within them no actual delineation between good or bad, only a Puritanical call to reason to turn its attention towards the other-ed created. This attention however relies on the perceptions and caricatures of Black torment that appeal to the whites’ self-assuring imagining of themselves, so that even when confronted with racism and their role as whites thinking about Black people incarcerated within a racist society and dying, these whites can claim that their conceptualization of racism itself, or (inter-sectionally) next to other injustices like poverty, sexism, homophobia, etc. makes them (whites) virtuous. It is the process of, the appeal to, “getting whites to recognize” (racist) oppression that allows the destruction of reality, Black death, to continue unabated, since it is the exact moment that whites are forced to engage racist problems in America, be it the anti-Black violence of American society, which animates the aversion of the justice system, the police state, the white citizenry, or the practice of American democracy itself—where the death of Black people/criminals/deviants/thugs remain normal and justified by whites—that they, the white(s) thinking about racism, get to impose upon Black reality, a racist moral maxim, namely that racism is not death and beyond –the end of – ethical calculus or moral evaluation, but ultimately contingent in America and of measurable consequence so much so that must be weighed next to the other democratic values that preserve this great white society: security, safety, individuality, property, profit, and freedom, the very values that when enacted by whites continue to perpetuate one ultimate end, the death of Blacks",9981.0,"<h4>2. <strong>Radically refuse their narcisstic valorization of their own ability to save minorities</h4><p>Curry, Southern Illinois philosophy professor, 2013</p><p><u>(Tommy, “In the Fiat of Dreams: The Delusional Allure of Hope, the Reality of Anti-Black Violence and the Demands of the Anti-Ethical”, Academia.edu)</p><p><mark>The potentiality of whiteness—the proleptic call of white anti-racist consciousness— is</mark> nothing more than the <mark>fiat of an ahistorical dream.</u></strong></mark> A command ushered before thought engages racism, before awareness of the world becomes aware of what is actual.

The scientific community is increasingly global; new scientific results are disseminated worldwide within hours of publication. From 1998 to 2008, the absolute number of internationally co-authored publications in science (including social sciences) and engineering almost doubled from 98,424 to 180,783 (representing over 20% of total publications in 2008) [1]. As the number of internationally co-authored journal articles proliferates, it is imperative to understand the impact that cross-border collaborations may have on the quality, productivity, and effectiveness of the research produced. Previous research has established that articles with authors from multiple countries were cited twice as frequently as publications authored by scientists working at a single institution or within a single country [2], [3]. Moreover, scholarship reveals that multi-institutional collaboration, particularly collaborations that involve institutions in different nations, also increased citation rate [2], [4], [5]. Reviewing overall science and engineering publications in 2008, 43% of internationally co-authored papers included US-based researchers. Germany and the UK shared the next highest percentage, with 19% each [1]. While Germany shares the second highest percentage of stem cell publications, Germany's stem cell policy is similar to US policy from 2001 to 2008, with restrictions on human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research based on the time the cells were derived [6]. In contrast to the US, the UK has a more permissive approach within a highly detailed regulatory system. The UK and US were therefore selected for this study due to their policy differences and high frequency of collaborations. Examining the impact of collaboration in these two countries will highlight the effects of disparate policy regimes on scientific research. Due to policy disparities between nations and extant international research networks, stem cell research is the ideal research area for a study of the impact of international collaboration. Stem cell research—embryonic, cord blood, adult, and induced pluripotent (iPS)—has the potential to revolutionize medicine and provide scientists with an improved understanding of cell development and specialization. Prior studies of stem cell research in the Middle East suggest that international collaborations resulted in stem cell publications with a higher citation rate than articles published by a single nation from the region [7]. However, no studies of collaborations in stem cell research have been conducted on publications with co-authors from two of the leading countries in this field, the US and the UK. Potential stem cell therapies offer the promise of possible treatments for debilitating injuries, e.g., spinal cord and brain trauma, and cures for debilitating diseases and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and blindness [8], [9]. At the same time, progress on hESC research in the US, in particular, is limited by policy restrictions and political uncertainties. For these reasons, stem cell research presents a unique opportunity not only to study international collaboration per se, but collaboration under very different policy regimes. Research from the US and the UK involving hESCs is conducted under quite different legislative policies. US policy on stem cell research has developed sporadically, has historically been more inhibitive than supportive, and has included only federal government funding of the research. By contrast, UK policy has developed in a more permissive, although highly regulated, manner [10]–[12]. Since 1978, following the first successful in vitro fertilization (IVF) birth, the UK has progressively built upon its policy. The first set of recommendations governing embryo research appeared in the Warnock Report, which was released in 1984 [13]. This report encouraged regulated embryo research. It also limited embryo research to the first 14 days of development, a standard now applied worldwide. In 1990, legislation to regulate embryo research, the Human Fertilization and Embryology (HFE) Act, was passed in the UK. This established the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which monitors and grants licenses for all embryo research, regardless of the source of funding [14]. As science progressed, the UK revised the HFE Act in 2001 and 2008 to take into account scientific advances such as the creation of the first hESC line [15]. In 2003, in order to provide storage for hESC lines created using HFEA licenses, the UK also launched the UK Stem Cell Bank. The UK has identified new funds specifically for stem cell research, apparently with little controversy [16]. It has also encouraged international collaborations through its commonwealth offices. In contrast to the UK, the US has been slow to adopt a comprehensive human embryo policy. In 1978, President Carter established the Ethics Advisory Board to monitor embryonic research, but after the election of President Reagan, the board never met and never approved a single project [10]. The board was eventually dismantled by the Clinton administration, which planned to provide funding for human embryo research. However, while the Clinton policy was being put in place, Congress passed the Dickey-Wicker amendment. This amendment, which has been added to the funding bill for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) each year since 1995, forbids the use of federal funds for research in which a human embryo is destroyed or subjected to risk of injury or death [17]. The amendment also bans federal funding for the creation of hESC cell lines, which were first derived in 1998, four years after the amendment was enacted. NIH carefully studied the Dickey-Wicker amendment and determined that it would permit funding of hESC research on stem cell lines derived from donated IVF embryos supported by non-federal funds. However, before any such research could be funded, Clinton left office. Limited hESC research funded by the federal government was allowed under President G.W. Bush, but only for lines created before August 9, 2001 (21 hESC lines) [18]. In 2009, under the Obama administration, federal funding for stem cell lines created after August 9, 2001, became available to researchers, but under strict guidelines. It is still not possible to use federal funds for the derivation of hESC lines regardless of the method used. In the US, there is no restriction on hESC research or even reproductive cloning as long as no federal funds are involved. Any potential stem cell therapy, however, requires demonstration of safety and efficacy and final approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The lack of a coherent approach and set of policies for human embryo and hESC research in the US has resulted in the most recent policy crisis. On August 23, 2010, US District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibited federal funding of any hESC for research [19]. This decision translated into an immediate injunction halting research at the NIH (both intramural and extramural research) and impacted grant decisions worth $140 million [20]. Approximately two weeks later, on September 9, 2010, a federal appeals court lifted the injunction and agreed to listen to arguments for and against the ban. The court still has not ruled on the case itself. With policy implications ranging from a permanent injunction or ban of hESC research to possible congressional legislation explicitly permitting federal funding of hESC, the current precarious nature of hESC research in the United States highlights the difficulties scientists face and serves as a possible barrier to international collaborations involving US researchers. In addition to policy disparities among nations, a second aspect of stem cell research that makes it an ideal research area for the study of international collaborations is its intrinsically international nature. This is evident in the various existing organizations that facilitate the exchange of research findings and policy information, e.g., the International Society for Stem Cell Research (www.isscr. org), the International Stem Cell Forum (www.stem-cell-forum. net), and the International Consortium of Stem Cell Networks (www.stemcellconsortium.org). These international organizations formed while the field was still young. This presents the opportunity to study a field that is characterized by high levels of international collaborative research from the start.

The goal of this article is to identify the impact of international collaboration on citation rates in stem cell research in the US and the UK. We specifically examined if international collaborations increase citation rates, and if differing research regulations and legislations affect the frequency of collaboration. Publications were examined from the US and the UK for the year 2008. Citation rates, country attribution, and collaborations were recorded for each article. In addition, we analyzed the political landscape and other driving factors, which may have contributed to the number and impact of these international collaborations. The data confirmed that, for both the US and the UK, international collaborations significantly increased an article’s impact (as measured by citation rates). It also demonstrated that the UK participated in a higher percentage of international publications than the US, which is congruent with trends of international collaborations in all sciences [1]. Four of the top five collaborators with the US were Germany, UK, Canada, and China, countries that were consistent across all fields of science, indicating that traditional collaborative relationships also predominated in international stem cell collaborations [1]. This suggests that policies and regulatory differences in the UK and US did not influence the frequency of international collaborations nor the countries that the US and UK collaborate with in stem cell research.",10033.0,"<h4>International cooperation and stem cell research is high now – regs are irrelevant. </h4><p><strong>LUO ET AL, Your Author, 2011</strong> Jingyuan., Science and Technology Policy Program, James A.

From 1998 to 2008, the absolute number of internationally co-authored publications in science (including social sciences) and engineering almost doubled from 98,424 to 180,783 (representing over 20% of total publications in 2008) [1]. As the number of internationally co-authored journal articles proliferates, it is imperative to understand the impact that cross-border collaborations may have on the quality, productivity, and effectiveness of the research produced. Previous research has established that articles with authors from multiple countries were cited twice as frequently as publications authored by scientists working at a single institution or within a single country [2], [3]. Moreover, scholarship reveals that multi-institutional collaboration, particularly collaborations that involve institutions in different nations, also increased citation rate [2], [4], [5]. Reviewing overall science and engineering publications in 2008, 43% of internationally co-authored papers included US-based researchers. Germany and the UK shared the next highest percentage, with 19% each [1]. While Germany shares the second highest percentage of stem cell publications, Germany's stem cell policy is similar to US policy from 2001 to 2008, with restrictions on human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research based on the time the cells were derived [6]. In contrast to the US, the UK has a more permissive approach within a highly detailed regulatory system. The UK and US were therefore selected for this study due to their policy differences and high frequency of collaborations. Examining the impact of collaboration in these two countries will highlight the effects of disparate policy regimes on scientific research. Due to policy disparities between nations and extant international research networks, stem cell research is the ideal research area for a study of the impact of international collaboration. Stem cell research—embryonic, cord blood, adult, and induced pluripotent (iPS)—has the potential to revolutionize medicine and provide scientists with an improved understanding of cell development and specialization. Prior studies of stem cell research in the Middle East suggest that international collaborations resulted in stem cell publications with a higher citation rate than articles published by a single nation from the region [7]. However, no studies of collaborations in stem cell research have been conducted on publications with co-authors from two of the leading countries in this field, the US and the UK. Potential stem cell therapies offer the promise of possible treatments for debilitating injuries, e.g., spinal cord and brain trauma, and cures for debilitating diseases and conditions such as Parkinson's disease, diabetes, and blindness [8], [9]. At the same time, progress on hESC research in the US, in particular, is limited by policy restrictions and political uncertainties. For these reasons, stem cell research presents a unique opportunity not only to study international collaboration per se, but collaboration under very different policy regimes. Research from the US and the UK involving hESCs is conducted under quite different legislative policies. US policy on stem cell research has developed sporadically, has historically been more inhibitive than supportive, and has included only federal government funding of the research. By contrast, UK policy has developed in a more permissive, although highly regulated, manner [10]–[12]. Since 1978, following the first successful in vitro fertilization (IVF) birth, the UK has progressively built upon its policy. The first set of recommendations governing embryo research appeared in the Warnock Report, which was released in 1984 [13]. This report encouraged regulated embryo research. It also limited embryo research to the first 14 days of development, a standard now applied worldwide. In 1990, legislation to regulate embryo research, the Human Fertilization and Embryology (HFE) Act, was passed in the UK. This established the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA), which monitors and grants licenses for all embryo research, regardless of the source of funding [14]. As science progressed, the UK revised the HFE Act in 2001 and 2008 to take into account scientific advances such as the creation of the first hESC line [15]. In 2003, in order to provide storage for hESC lines created using HFEA licenses, the UK also launched the UK Stem Cell Bank. The UK has identified new funds specifically for stem cell research, apparently with little controversy [16]. It has also encouraged international collaborations through its commonwealth offices. In contrast to the UK, the US has been slow to adopt a comprehensive human embryo policy. In 1978, President Carter established the Ethics Advisory Board to monitor embryonic research, but after the election of President Reagan, the board never met and never approved a single project [10]. The board was eventually dismantled by the Clinton administration, which planned to provide funding for human embryo research. However, while the Clinton policy was being put in place, Congress passed the Dickey-Wicker amendment. This amendment, which has been added to the funding bill for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) each year since 1995, forbids the use of federal funds for research in which a human embryo is destroyed or subjected to risk of injury or death [17]. The amendment also bans federal funding for the creation of hESC cell lines, which were first derived in 1998, four years after the amendment was enacted. NIH carefully studied the Dickey-Wicker amendment and determined that it would permit funding of hESC research on stem cell lines derived from donated IVF embryos supported by non-federal funds. However, before any such research could be funded, Clinton left office. Limited hESC research funded by the federal government was allowed under President G.W. Bush, but only for lines created before August 9, 2001 (21 hESC lines) [18]. In 2009, under the Obama administration, federal funding for stem cell lines created after August 9, 2001, became available to researchers, but under strict guidelines. It is still not possible to use federal funds for the derivation of hESC lines regardless of the method used. In the US, there is no restriction on hESC research or even reproductive cloning as long as no federal funds are involved. Any potential stem cell therapy, however, requires demonstration of safety and efficacy and final approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The lack of a coherent approach and set of policies for human embryo and hESC research in the US has resulted in the most recent policy crisis. On August 23, 2010, US District Judge Royce Lamberth ruled that the Dickey-Wicker amendment prohibited federal funding of any hESC for research [19]. This decision translated into an immediate injunction halting research at the NIH (both intramural and extramural research) and impacted grant decisions worth $140 million [20]. Approximately two weeks later, on September 9, 2010, a federal appeals court lifted the injunction and agreed to listen to arguments for and against the ban. The court still has not ruled on the case itself. With policy implications ranging from a permanent injunction or ban of hESC research to possible congressional legislation explicitly permitting federal funding of hESC, the current precarious nature of hESC research in the United States highlights the difficulties scientists face and serves as a possible barrier to international collaborations involving US researchers. <strong>In addition to policy disparities among nations, a second aspect of stem cell research that makes it an ideal research area for the study of international collaborations is its intrinsically international nature. This is evident in the various existing organizations that facilitate the exchange of research findings and policy information, e.g., the International Society for Stem Cell Research (www.isscr. org), the International Stem Cell Forum (www.stem-cell-forum. net), and the International Consortium of Stem Cell Networks (www.stemcellconsortium.org). These international organizations formed while the field was still young. This presents the opportunity to study a field that is characterized by high levels of international collaborative research from the start.</p><p><u><Emory Ends></p><p></u></strong>The goal of this article is to identify the impact of international collaboration on citation rates in stem cell research in the US and the UK. We specifically examined if international collaborations increase citation rates, and if differing research regulations and legislations affect the frequency of collaboration.

But given the historical evolution and expansion of the criminal legal system, I cannot trust that tweaking one very specific area of the system will change its overall violent nature, specifically the way it criminalizes poverty and operates as a system of racialized social control. Furthermore, I am hesitant to get too hopeful about or wrapped up in the possibilities that reversing the “War on Drugs” may bring, since such a narrow focus obscures the complex ways the criminal legal system likely will continue to target disadvantaged communities. My current research with formerly incarcerated women makes me concerned that even if the state makes the positive shift to stop locking people up for drugs, it will just find other things for which to imprison people. To explain, all of the women with whom I’ve worked as part of my dissertation research have been incarcerated for behaviors related to their substance abuse. Their official charges, however, are not always drug charges. While many women’s records include drug-related charges such as possession, manufacturing, and distribution, they also include charges such as prostitution, possession of a firearm, child endangerment, and assault. In all of these non-drug cases, their “crimes” were deeply tied to their substance abuse. The non-drug charges mask deep-rooted struggles with substance abuse, efforts to stop using, and relapse. And just like the official drug charges, they mask experiences of poverty and trauma and work to criminalize the survival strategies of certain women, specifically poor women, women of color, and women living in disadvantaged communities that routinely are targeted by law enforcement. The important lesson here is that a decrease in drug-related charges will not ensure a decrease in incarceration. Rather, the criminal legal system easily can continue to criminalize drugs and even carry out a “war on drugs” without arresting and locking people up for drug crimes per se. All of us who care about social justice must pay attention to what new form the “War on Drugs” takes. Investing in Alternatives to Mass Incarceration But let’s imagine that the United States does enter an era of decarceration. Let’s imagine that at the state and federal levels, the criminal legal system moves away from imprisoning people not only for drug-related charges but for a whole host of “crimes.” Let’s imagine that the U.S. government turns to community corrections and alternatives to incarceration. Such shifts raise a crucial question: Are local, state, and federal governments willing to invest in these programs? Presently, there is little political will to adequately fund re-entry programs, as recovery homes and non-residential re-entry services throughout Chicago are terribly under-resourced. Although the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) provides limited funding to recovery homes for housing people who are on parole, recovery homes struggle to keep their doors open. The women with whom I’ve worked for my dissertation research explain that many homes require residents to turn their LINK cards (food stamps) over to the recovery home staff, who in turn purchase food for the house. Women also discussed how after their individual IDOC funding runs out, some recovery homes require them to pay rent in order to continue to reside there. Some women described uninhabitable living conditions, such as rodents and standing water. These same women also expressed deep gratitude for the assistance they have received from these programs. All in all, many recovery homes are doing the best they can with the limited funds they have to assist women in their transitions out of prison. But in many cases, this assistance is not enough, and women become desperate to move out, often into precarious living situations with partners, friends, or family or into unstable arrangements where they rent a room in buildings where drug use and prostitution is common. If the re-entry field in Chicago is any indication of the state’s willingness to invest in supportive programs for people who are in trouble with the law, the likelihood that the state will provide adequate financial support for community corrections and alternatives to incarceration is not promising. As Political Scientist Marie Gottschalk recently warned during her talk at the American Sociological Association’s Annual Meeting, folks who advocate for “justice reinvestment” must pay attention to whether the money saved through decarceration in fact goes back into communities. There is no guarantee that these proposed savings translate to resources for the very communities that law enforcement targets. Thus, in addition to advocating for decarceration, prison reformists and abolitionists must also demand actual investment in alternatives. The rhetoric of decarceration must not obscure the harsh realities that people in trouble with the law regularly encounter. Punishment without Mass Incarceration Perhaps most importantly, prison reformists and abolitionists must also focus on the underlying logics of mass incarceration. Scholars have well documented the punitive turn the criminal legal system has taken since the mid-1970s, as jails and prisons have abandoned rehabilitation in favor of punishment. But punishment does not end at the jail or prison gate. Rather, it follows the nearly five million people who are on probation or parole into the communities to where they return upon leaving jail and prison. As many research participants have shared with me, probation and parole are just “set-ups.” In other words, it is just a matter of time before people living under the correctional supervision of the state slip up and find themselves re-incarcerated. Most of the women I have interviewed are living highly regulated lives and discussed routine instances of intrusive surveillance, such as random drug testing through urinalysis at recovery homes, treatment programs, and parole and probation offices. Whereas substance abuse specialists routinely note that relapse is a common part of the recovery process, women who are on parole and probation face severe consequences when they do relapse, such as loss of their housing and re-incarceration. In this way, the criminal legal system effectively criminalizes recovery for women living on the margins of society, as formerly incarcerated women do not have the luxury to relapse. That luxury is reserved for more privileged groups for whom criminalization, punishment, substance abuse, and recovery are not intricately intertwined. Truly investing in community corrections programs that connect people to supportive services, employment, and housing likely will spare people the trauma of incarceration and aid with the seemingly insurmountable task of reintegration to society. But it is important to understand whether and how such programs prolong the threat of punishment in people’s lives. While I support diverting funding from prisons to alternatives to incarceration, I do not complacently and naively assume that these alternatives will restructure the underlying power relations and oppressive practices of our criminal legal system. As Project NIA founder and director Mariame Kaba advised during the August 15th event Transformative Justice and the Trayvon Martin Case: A Consideration, “For any reform, ask, ‘Is it shortening or extending the reach of the state?’” In the worst-case scenario, alternatives to incarceration may actually strengthen the carceral state by further extending its reach into communities. And let’s be clear that certain communities will feel the state’s extended reach. Sociologist Reuben Miller’s research shows that Chicago’s re-entry programs are heavily concentrated in the same south and west side communities to where the majority of incarcerated people in Illinois return upon release. The move from mass incarceration through prisons to mass incarceration through community corrections likely will deepen the roots of the carceral state in these same racially segregated communities that experience high rates of poverty and surveillance. The Need for Transformation To truly revamp the criminal legal system and begin to address in any meaningful way the severe harm that the “War on Drugs” and mass incarceration have ravaged across disadvantaged communities, the United States needs to abandon its collective commitment to and fixation with punishment. As long as punishment is the underlying driving force of the criminal legal system, the state will continue to perpetuate inequality and harm. As Lynne Haney (2013:127) concludes in her recent article in Signs about mothering in an alternative-to-incarceration program in California, “the pull to punitiveness will continue to undermine the promise to provide real alternatives to incarceration.” What follows, then, is that prison reformists and abolitionists must work for transformation of the very logic of the criminal legal system, rather than transforming specific components. More broadly, we must work for societal transformation in which notions of justice are not tied to punishment. This is the type of work that Angela Davis refers to when discussing how to envision a world without prisons. As Davis explains in Are Prisons Obsolete? (2003) and The Meaning of Freedom (2012), abolition is not only about tearing down prisons; it also is about building up resources. Talk of ending the “War on Drugs” and ushering in an era of decarceration is enticing. Such talk must not distract prison reformists, prison abolitionists, and social justice activists in general from the larger project of “pulling apart the conceptual link between crime and punishment” (Davis 2003:112) and building true alternatives not only to incarceration but also to punishment.",9903.0,"<h4>The Aff’s insufficient</h4><p><strong>Rumpf 13</strong> Chez, PhD Candidate in Sociology – Loyola University Chicago, The Future of Mass Incarceration: Punishment in the Proposed Era of Decarceration<u><strong>, http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/2013/08/27/guest-post-the-future-of-mass-incarceration-punishment-in-the-proposed-era-of-decarceration/</p><p></u></strong>To be clear, I think it is important to acknowledge the positive shift Holder’s comments signify.

The Need for Transformation <u><strong><mark>To truly revamp the</mark> <mark>criminal legal system</mark> <mark>and</mark> begin to <mark>address</mark> in any meaningful way <mark>the</mark> severe harm that the <mark>“War on Drugs”</mark> and mass incarceration have ravaged across disadvantaged communities,</u></strong> <u><strong><mark>the U</mark>nited <mark>S</mark>tates <mark>needs to abandon its</mark> collective <mark>commitment to</mark> and fixation with <mark>punishment</u></strong></mark>. <u><strong><mark>As long as punishment is the</mark> underlying <mark>driving force of the criminal legal system, the state will</mark> continue to <mark>perpetuate</mark> <mark>inequality</mark> and harm.</u></strong> As Lynne Haney (2013:127) concludes in her recent article in Signs about mothering in an alternative-to-incarceration program in California, “the pull to punitiveness will continue to undermine the promise to provide real alternatives to incarceration.” What follows, then, is that <u><strong>prison reformists and abolitionists must work for transformation of the very logic of the criminal legal system, <mark>rather than transforming specific components</mark>.</u></strong> More broadly, <u><strong><mark>we must</mark> <mark>work for</mark> <mark>societal transformation</mark> in which notions of justice are not tied to punishment.</u></strong> This is the type of work that Angela Davis refers to when discussing how to envision a world without prisons. As Davis explains in Are Prisons Obsolete? (2003) and The Meaning of Freedom (2012), <u><strong>abolition is not only about tearing down prisons; it also is about building up resources</u></strong>. <u><strong>Talk of ending the “War on Drugs” and ushering in an era of decarceration is enticing</u></strong>. <u><strong><mark>Such talk must not distract</mark> prison reformists, prison abolitionists, and social justice activists in general <mark>from the </mark>larger <mark>project of “pulling apart the conceptual link </mark>between crime and punishment” </u></strong>(Davis 2003:112) <u><strong>and building true alternatives not only to incarceration but also to punishment.</p></u></strong>",1nc,,case,54465,8,18039,./documents/ndtceda14/Kentucky/HaRo/Kentucky-Hampton-Roman-Neg-Wake-Round4.docx,567898,N,Wake,4,George Washington Trevett-Tobey,Fifelski,"1ac

It is hard to say which is more surprising, that anyone still argues that we can predict very little or that anyone believes expertise conveys reliable judgment. Each reflects a bad habit of mind that we should overcome. It is certainly true that predictive efforts, by whatever means, are far from perfect and so we can always come up with examples of failure. But a proper assessment of progress in predictive accuracy, as Gardner and Tetlock surely agree, requires that we compare the rate of success and failure across methods of prediction rather than picking only examples of failure (or success). How often, for instance, has The Economist been wrong or right in its annual forecasts compared to other forecasters? Knowing that they did poorly in 2011 or that they did well in some other selected year doesn’t help answer that question. That is why, as Gardner and Tetlock emphasize, predictive methods can best be evaluated through comparative tournaments. Reliable prediction is so much a part of our daily lives that we don’t even notice it. Consider the insurance industry. At least since Johan de Witt (1625–1672) exploited the mathematics of probability and uncertainty, insurance companies have generally been profitable. Similarly, polling and other statistical methods for predicting elections are sufficiently accurate most of the time that we forget that these methods supplanted expert judgment decades ago. Models have replaced pundits as the means by which elections are predicted exactly because various (imperfect) statistical approaches routinely outperform expert prognostications. More recently, sophisticated game theory models have proven sufficiently predictive that they have become a mainstay of high-stakes government and business auctions such as bandwidth auctions. Game theory models have also found extensive use and well-documented predictive success on both sides of the Atlantic in helping to resolve major national security issues, labor-management disputes, and complex business problems. Are these methods perfect or omniscient? Certainly not! Are the marginal returns to knowledge over naïve methods (expert opinion; predicting that tomorrow will be just like today) substantial? I believe the evidence warrants an enthusiastic “Yes!” Nevertheless, despite the numerous successes in designing predictive methods, we appropriately focus on failures. After all, by studying failure methodically we are likely to make progress in eliminating some errors in the future. Experts are an easy, although eminently justified, target for critiquing predictive accuracy. Their failure to outperform simple statistical algorithms should come as no surprise. Expertise has nothing to do with judgment or foresight. What makes an expert is the accumulation of an exceptional quantity of facts about some place or time. The idea that such expertise translates into reliable judgment rests on the false belief that knowing “the facts” is all that is necessary to draw correct inferences. This is but one form of the erroneous linkage of correlation to causation; a linkage at the heart of current data mining methods. It is even more so an example of confusing data (the facts) with a method for drawing inferences. Reliance on expert judgment ignores their personal beliefs as a noisy filter applied to the selection and utilization of facts. Consider, for instance, that Republicans, Democrats, and libertarians all know the same essential facts about the U.S. economy and all probably desire the same outcomes: low unemployment, low inflation, and high growth. The facts, however, do not lead experts to the same judgment about what to do to achieve the desired outcomes. That requires a theory and balanced evidence about what gets us from a distressed economy to a well-functioning one. Of course, lacking a common theory and biased by personal beliefs, the experts’ predictions will be widely scattered. Good prediction—and this is my belief—comes from dependence on logic and evidence to draw inferences about the causal path from facts to outcomes. Unfortunately, government, business, and the media assume that expertise—knowing the history, culture, mores, and language of a place, for instance—is sufficient to anticipate the unfolding of events. Indeed, too often many of us dismiss approaches to prediction that require knowledge of statistical methods, mathematics, and systematic research design. We seem to prefer “wisdom” over science, even though the evidence shows that the application of the scientific method, with all of its demands, outperforms experts (remember Johan de Witt). The belief that area expertise, for instance, is sufficient to anticipate the future is, as Tetlock convincingly demonstrated, just plain false. If we hope to build reliable predictions about human behavior, whether in China, Cameroon, or Connecticut, then probably we must first harness facts to the systematic, repeated, transparent application of the same logic across connected families of problems. By doing so we can test alternative ways of thinking to uncover what works and what doesn’t in different circumstances. Here Gardner, Tetlock, and I could not agree more. Prediction tournaments are an essential ingredient to work out what the current limits are to improved knowledge and predictive accuracy. Of course, improvements in knowledge and accuracy will always be a moving target because technology, ideas, and subject adaptation will be ongoing. Given what we know today and given the problems inherent in dealing with human interaction, what is a leading contender for making accurate, discriminating, useful predictions of complex human decisions? In good hedgehog mode I believe one top contender is applied game theory. Of course there are others but I am betting on game theory as the right place to invest effort. Why? Because game theory is the only method of which I am aware that explicitly compels us to address human adaptability. Gardner and Tetlock rightly note that people are “self-aware beings who see, think, talk, and attempt to predict each other’s behavior—and who are continually adapting to each other’s efforts to predict each other’s behavior, adding layer after layer of new calculations and new complexity.” This adaptation is what game theory jargon succinctly calls “endogenous choice.” Predicting human behavior means solving for endogenous choices while assessing uncertainty. It certainly isn’t easy but, as the example of bandwidth auctions helps clarify, game theorists are solving for human adaptability and uncertainty with some success. Indeed, I used game theoretic reasoning on May 5, 2010 to predict to a large investment group’s portfolio committee that Mubarak’s regime faced replacement, especially by the Muslim Brotherhood, in the coming year. That prediction did not rely on in-depth knowledge of Egyptian history and culture or on expert judgment but rather on a game theory model called selectorate theory and its implications for the concurrent occurrence of logically derived revolutionary triggers. Thus, while the desire for revolution had been present in Egypt (and elsewhere) for many years, logic suggested that the odds of success and the expected rewards for revolution were rising swiftly in 2010 in Egypt while the expected costs were not. This is but one example that highlights what Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow, who was quoted by Gardner and Tetlock, has said about game theory and prediction (referring, as it happens, to a specific model I developed for predicting policy decisions): “Bueno de Mesquita has demonstrated the power of using game theory and related assumptions of rational and self-seeking behavior in predicting the outcome of important political and legal processes.” Nice as his statement is for me personally, the broader point is that game theory in the hands of much better game theorists than I am has the potential to transform our ability to anticipate the consequences of alternative choices in many aspects of human interaction. How can game theory be harnessed to achieve reliable prediction? Acting like a fox, I gather information from a wide variety of experts. They are asked only for specific current information (Who wants to influence a decision? What outcome do they currently advocate? How focused are they on the issue compared to other questions on their plate? How flexible are they about getting the outcome they advocate? And how much clout could they exert?). They are not asked to make judgments about what will happen. Then, acting as a hedgehog, I use that information as data with which to seed a dynamic applied game theory model. The model’s logic then produces not only specific predictions about the issues in question, but also a probability distribution around the predictions. The predictions are detailed and nuanced. They address not only what outcome is likely to arise, but also how each “player” will act, how they are likely to relate to other players over time, what they believe about each other, and much more. Methods like this are credited by the CIA, academic specialists and others, as being accurate about 90 percent of the time based on large-sample assessments. These methods have been subjected to peer review with predictions published well ahead of the outcome being known and with the issues forecast being important questions of their time with much controversy over how they were expected to be resolved. This is not so much a testament to any insight I may have had but rather to the virtue of combining the focus of the hedgehog with the breadth of the fox.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states. In response to this concern, The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty authored a study titled, The Responsibility to Protect,12 calling for revisions to the understanding of sovereignty within the United Nations (UN) charter. This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. Any effort to legitimize and support a liberal world construct requires the United States to adopt a multilateral doctrine which avoids the precepts of the previous administration: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of unilateralism,”14 which have resulted in the alienation of former allies worldwide. Predominantly Muslim nations, whose citizens had previously looked to the United States as an example of representative governance, viewed the Iraq invasion as the seminal dividing action between the Western and the Islamic world. Appropriately, any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion. Even if China executes a peaceful rise and the United States overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, it is more likely that China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the United States as the regional hegemonic power. Recognizing this threat now, the United States must prepare for the eventual transition and immediately begin building the legitimacy and support of a system of rules that will protect its interests later when we are no longer the world's only superpower.",10053.0,"<h4><strong>Investing in multilateral institutions solves the transition and great power conflicts-it’s the <u>greatest threat to international stability</u>. </h4><p><u>Fujimoto, 2012</u></strong> (Kevin, Lt.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states. In response to this concern, The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty authored a study titled, The Responsibility to Protect,12 calling for revisions to the understanding of sovereignty within the United Nations (UN) charter. This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. Any effort to legitimize and support a liberal world construct requires the United States to adopt a multilateral doctrine which avoids the precepts of the previous administration: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of unilateralism,”14 which have resulted in the alienation of former allies worldwide. Predominantly Muslim nations, whose citizens had previously looked to the United States as an example of representative governance, viewed the Iraq invasion as the seminal dividing action between the Western and the Islamic world. Appropriately, any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion. Even if China executes a peaceful rise and the United States overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, it is more likely that China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the United States as the regional hegemonic power. Recognizing this threat now, the United States must prepare for the eventual transition and immediately begin building the legitimacy and support of a system of rules that will protect its interests later when we are no longer the world's only superpower.",10053.0,"<h4><strong>Investing in multilateral institutions solves the transition and great power conflicts-it’s the <u>greatest threat to international stability</u>. </h4><p><u>Fujimoto, 2012</u></strong> (Kevin, Lt.

Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion. Even if China executes a peaceful rise and the United States overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, it is more likely that China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the United States as the regional hegemonic power.

This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. <u><strong>Any effort to legitimize and support a liberal world construct requires the United States to adopt a multilateral doctrine which avoids the precepts of the previous administration: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of unilateralism</u></strong>,”14 <u><strong>which</u></strong> have <u><strong>resulted in the alienation of former allies</u></strong> worldwide. Predominantly Muslim nations, whose citizens had previously looked to the United States as an example of representative governance, viewed the Iraq invasion as the seminal dividing action between the Western and the Islamic world. Appropriately<u><strong>, </u></strong>any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 <u><strong>American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles</u></strong> that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that <u><strong>true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples</u></strong> . . .”16 <u><strong>and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order.</u></strong> Investment in <u><strong><mark>a liberal world order would</mark> also <mark>set the conditions for the</mark> <mark>U</u></strong></mark>nited <u><strong><mark>S</u></strong></mark>tates <u><strong><mark>to garner support from</mark> noncommitted regional powers</u></strong> (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), <u><strong>or “<mark>swing civilizations</u></strong></mark>,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, <u><strong><mark>which</u></strong></mark> will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately <u><strong><mark>have the ability to offset China's</mark> imperial <mark>dominance</u></strong></mark> in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that <u><strong><mark>China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it</mark>. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty</u></strong>,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion<u><strong>. <mark>Even if China executes a peaceful rise</u></strong></mark> and <u><strong>the U</u></strong>nited <u><strong>S</u></strong>tates <u><strong>overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest</u></strong>, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, <u><strong>it is more likely that <mark>China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the U</mark>nited <mark>S</mark>tates <mark>as the</mark> regional <mark>hegemon</mark>ic power.

But given the historical evolution and expansion of the criminal legal system, I cannot trust that tweaking one very specific area of the system will change its overall violent nature, specifically the way it criminalizes poverty and operates as a system of racialized social control. Furthermore, I am hesitant to get too hopeful about or wrapped up in the possibilities that reversing the “War on Drugs” may bring, since such a narrow focus obscures the complex ways the criminal legal system likely will continue to target disadvantaged communities. My current research with formerly incarcerated women makes me concerned that even if the state makes the positive shift to stop locking people up for drugs, it will just find other things for which to imprison people. To explain, all of the women with whom I’ve worked as part of my dissertation research have been incarcerated for behaviors related to their substance abuse. Their official charges, however, are not always drug charges. While many women’s records include drug-related charges such as possession, manufacturing, and distribution, they also include charges such as prostitution, possession of a firearm, child endangerment, and assault. In all of these non-drug cases, their “crimes” were deeply tied to their substance abuse. The non-drug charges mask deep-rooted struggles with substance abuse, efforts to stop using, and relapse. And just like the official drug charges, they mask experiences of poverty and trauma and work to criminalize the survival strategies of certain women, specifically poor women, women of color, and women living in disadvantaged communities that routinely are targeted by law enforcement. The important lesson here is that a decrease in drug-related charges will not ensure a decrease in incarceration. Rather, the criminal legal system easily can continue to criminalize drugs and even carry out a “war on drugs” without arresting and locking people up for drug crimes per se. All of us who care about social justice must pay attention to what new form the “War on Drugs” takes. Investing in Alternatives to Mass Incarceration But let’s imagine that the United States does enter an era of decarceration. Let’s imagine that at the state and federal levels, the criminal legal system moves away from imprisoning people not only for drug-related charges but for a whole host of “crimes.” Let’s imagine that the U.S. government turns to community corrections and alternatives to incarceration. Such shifts raise a crucial question: Are local, state, and federal governments willing to invest in these programs? Presently, there is little political will to adequately fund re-entry programs, as recovery homes and non-residential re-entry services throughout Chicago are terribly under-resourced. Although the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) provides limited funding to recovery homes for housing people who are on parole, recovery homes struggle to keep their doors open. The women with whom I’ve worked for my dissertation research explain that many homes require residents to turn their LINK cards (food stamps) over to the recovery home staff, who in turn purchase food for the house. Women also discussed how after their individual IDOC funding runs out, some recovery homes require them to pay rent in order to continue to reside there. Some women described uninhabitable living conditions, such as rodents and standing water. These same women also expressed deep gratitude for the assistance they have received from these programs. All in all, many recovery homes are doing the best they can with the limited funds they have to assist women in their transitions out of prison. But in many cases, this assistance is not enough, and women become desperate to move out, often into precarious living situations with partners, friends, or family or into unstable arrangements where they rent a room in buildings where drug use and prostitution is common. If the re-entry field in Chicago is any indication of the state’s willingness to invest in supportive programs for people who are in trouble with the law, the likelihood that the state will provide adequate financial support for community corrections and alternatives to incarceration is not promising. As Political Scientist Marie Gottschalk recently warned during her talk at the American Sociological Association’s Annual Meeting, folks who advocate for “justice reinvestment” must pay attention to whether the money saved through decarceration in fact goes back into communities. There is no guarantee that these proposed savings translate to resources for the very communities that law enforcement targets. Thus, in addition to advocating for decarceration, prison reformists and abolitionists must also demand actual investment in alternatives. The rhetoric of decarceration must not obscure the harsh realities that people in trouble with the law regularly encounter. Punishment without Mass Incarceration Perhaps most importantly, prison reformists and abolitionists must also focus on the underlying logics of mass incarceration. Scholars have well documented the punitive turn the criminal legal system has taken since the mid-1970s, as jails and prisons have abandoned rehabilitation in favor of punishment. But punishment does not end at the jail or prison gate. Rather, it follows the nearly five million people who are on probation or parole into the communities to where they return upon leaving jail and prison. As many research participants have shared with me, probation and parole are just “set-ups.” In other words, it is just a matter of time before people living under the correctional supervision of the state slip up and find themselves re-incarcerated. Most of the women I have interviewed are living highly regulated lives and discussed routine instances of intrusive surveillance, such as random drug testing through urinalysis at recovery homes, treatment programs, and parole and probation offices. Whereas substance abuse specialists routinely note that relapse is a common part of the recovery process, women who are on parole and probation face severe consequences when they do relapse, such as loss of their housing and re-incarceration. In this way, the criminal legal system effectively criminalizes recovery for women living on the margins of society, as formerly incarcerated women do not have the luxury to relapse. That luxury is reserved for more privileged groups for whom criminalization, punishment, substance abuse, and recovery are not intricately intertwined. Truly investing in community corrections programs that connect people to supportive services, employment, and housing likely will spare people the trauma of incarceration and aid with the seemingly insurmountable task of reintegration to society. But it is important to understand whether and how such programs prolong the threat of punishment in people’s lives. While I support diverting funding from prisons to alternatives to incarceration, I do not complacently and naively assume that these alternatives will restructure the underlying power relations and oppressive practices of our criminal legal system. As Project NIA founder and director Mariame Kaba advised during the August 15th event Transformative Justice and the Trayvon Martin Case: A Consideration, “For any reform, ask, ‘Is it shortening or extending the reach of the state?’” In the worst-case scenario, alternatives to incarceration may actually strengthen the carceral state by further extending its reach into communities. And let’s be clear that certain communities will feel the state’s extended reach. Sociologist Reuben Miller’s research shows that Chicago’s re-entry programs are heavily concentrated in the same south and west side communities to where the majority of incarcerated people in Illinois return upon release. The move from mass incarceration through prisons to mass incarceration through community corrections likely will deepen the roots of the carceral state in these same racially segregated communities that experience high rates of poverty and surveillance. The Need for Transformation To truly revamp the criminal legal system and begin to address in any meaningful way the severe harm that the “War on Drugs” and mass incarceration have ravaged across disadvantaged communities, the United States needs to abandon its collective commitment to and fixation with punishment. As long as punishment is the underlying driving force of the criminal legal system, the state will continue to perpetuate inequality and harm. As Lynne Haney (2013:127) concludes in her recent article in Signs about mothering in an alternative-to-incarceration program in California, “the pull to punitiveness will continue to undermine the promise to provide real alternatives to incarceration.” What follows, then, is that prison reformists and abolitionists must work for transformation of the very logic of the criminal legal system, rather than transforming specific components. More broadly, we must work for societal transformation in which notions of justice are not tied to punishment. This is the type of work that Angela Davis refers to when discussing how to envision a world without prisons. As Davis explains in Are Prisons Obsolete? (2003) and The Meaning of Freedom (2012), abolition is not only about tearing down prisons; it also is about building up resources. Talk of ending the “War on Drugs” and ushering in an era of decarceration is enticing. Such talk must not distract prison reformists, prison abolitionists, and social justice activists in general from the larger project of “pulling apart the conceptual link between crime and punishment” (Davis 2003:112) and building true alternatives not only to incarceration but also to punishment.",9903.0,"<h4>Alt cause - punishment paradigm</h4><p><u><strong>Rumpf 13</u></strong> Chez, PhD Candidate in Sociology – Loyola University Chicago, The Future of Mass Incarceration: Punishment in the Proposed Era of Decarceration<u><strong>, http://www.usprisonculture.com/blog/2013/08/27/guest-post-the-future-of-mass-incarceration-punishment-in-the-proposed-era-of-decarceration/</p><p></u></strong>To be clear, I think it is important to acknowledge the positive shift Holder’s comments signify.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states. In response to this concern, The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty authored a study titled, The Responsibility to Protect,12 calling for revisions to the understanding of sovereignty within the United Nations (UN) charter. This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. Any effort to legitimize and support a liberal world construct requires the United States to adopt a multilateral doctrine which avoids the precepts of the previous administration: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of unilateralism,”14 which have resulted in the alienation of former allies worldwide. Predominantly Muslim nations, whose citizens had previously looked to the United States as an example of representative governance, viewed the Iraq invasion as the seminal dividing action between the Western and the Islamic world. Appropriately, any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion. Even if China executes a peaceful rise and the United States overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, it is more likely that China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the United States as the regional hegemonic power. Recognizing this threat now, the United States must prepare for the eventual transition and immediately begin building the legitimacy and support of a system of rules that will protect its interests later when we are no longer the world's only superpower.",10053.0,"<h4><strong>Investing in multilateral institutions solves the transition and great power conflicts-it’s the <u>greatest threat to international stability</u>. </h4><p><u>Fujimoto, 2012</u></strong> (Kevin, Lt.

Appropriately, any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion. Even if China executes a peaceful rise and the United States overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, it is more likely that China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the United States as the regional hegemonic power. Recognizing this threat now, the United States must prepare for the eventual transition and immediately begin building the legitimacy and support of a system of rules that will protect its interests later when we are no longer the world's only superpower.",10053.0,"<h4><strong>Investing in multilateral institutions solves the transition and great power conflicts-it’s the <u>greatest threat to international stability</u>. </h4><p><u>Fujimoto, 2012</u></strong> (Kevin, Lt.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states.

In this view, we should expect a return to business as usual, with the US picking up the signature themes of multilateralism and the market that have underpinned its world role since the end of the Second World War. Although by no means universally loved, the US was an effective leader through the Cold War and beyond not only because it promoted liberal economic and political values that were attractive to many others, but also because it was prepared to bind its own power in multilateral rules and institutions sufficiently that its followers could contain their fear of its overwhelming power. Does Obama’s liberal stance mean that we should expect a return to the leadership role that the US has exercised for more than half a century? I argue that this is unlikely to happen because there are now three powerful constraints that will largely block a return to US leadership. The first is that the US has lost much of its followership. The second is that the capacity of the US to lead is now much weakened even if it still retains the will to do so. The third is that there is a general turn within international society against hegemony and therefore against the global leadership role itself. LOST FOLLOWERSHIP If the US remains willing to lead, will anyone follow? There are two issues here: the growing range of policy disagreements on specific issues between the US and others; and the decline of shared values and visions between the US and its former followers. A good symbol of the weakening relationship between the US and its followers is the replacement of talk about ‘friends and allies’ or ‘the free world’ with a much harsher and still basically unchanged, line about ‘coalitions of the willing’. There is some hope that under Obama differences over policy might improve in specific areas, particularly the environment, but even on that issue Obama will be lucky just to get the US seen as not part of the problem. Domestic constraints on carbon pricing and accepting binding international standards will make it difficult for the US to lead. Many other areas of disagreement remain, some deep. The US has failed to make the war on terrorism into anything like the binding cause that underpinned its leadership during the Cold War, and its policies continue to erode its liberal credentials. By its use of torture, and even moreso the public advocacy of such interrogation techniques by senior Bush administration figures, and by its rejection of the Geneva Conventions on prisoners or war, it exposed itself to ridicule and contempt as an advocate for human rights. That China is still plausibly able to criticise the US on human rights and environment issues is a marker of how far Washington’s reputation has fallen. US policy in the Middle East, particularly on Israel, has few followers, and the repercussions of the disastrous interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan continue to rattle on. Unless China turns quite nasty, the inclination of many in the US to see China as a challenger to its unipolar position is unlikely to attract much sympathy. The financial chaos of 2008-9 has undermined Washington’s credibility as an economic leader. Anti-Americanism, though obviously not newbecame exceptionally strong under Bush, and is now more culturally based, and more corrosive of shared identities. It questions whether the ‘American way of life’ is an appropriate model for the rest of the world, and whether the US economic model is either sustainable or desirable. It looks at health; at a seeming US inclination to use force as the first choice policy instrument, with its domestic parallel of gun culture; at the influence of religion and special interest lobbies in US domestic politics; at a US government which was openly comfortable with the use of torture and was re-elected; and at a federal environmental policy until recently in denial about global warming; and asks not just whether the US is a questionable model, but whether it has become a serious part of the problem. While some of this was specific to the Bush administration, and is being turned around by Obama, some of the deeper issues are more structural. The US is much more culturally conservative, religious, individualistic, and anti-state than most other parts of the West. America’s religion and cultural conservatism and anti-statism set it apart from most of Europe, where disappointment with Obama is already palpable. America’s individualism and anti-statism set it apart from Asia, where China is anyway disinclined to be a follower. This kind of anti-Americanism rests on very real differences, and raises the possibility that the idea of ‘the West’ was just a passing epiphenomenon of the Cold War. The Bush administration asset-stripped half-a-century of respect for, goodwill towards and trust in US leadership, and it reflected, and helped to consolidate, a shift in the centre of gravity of US politics. The Obama administration cannot just go back to the late 1990s and pick up from where Clinton left off. LOST CAPACITY In addition to having less common ground with its followers the US also has less capacity, both material and ideological, to play the role of leader. The rise of China, and also India, Brazil and others, means that the US now operates in a world in which the distribution of power is becoming more diffuse, and in which several centres of power are not closely linked to it, and some are opposed. In this context, the Bush legacy of a crashed economy and an enormous debt severely constrain the leadership options of the Obama administration. The economic crisis of 2008-9 not only hamstrung the US in terms of material capability, but also stripped away the Washington consensus as the ideological legitimizer for US leadership. The collapse of neoliberal ideology might yet be seen as an ideational event on the same scale as the collapse of communism in 1989. Since the late 1990s, and very sharply since 2003, the US has in many ways become the enemy of its own 20th century project and thus of its own capacity to lead. Not surprisingly this has deepened a longstanding disjuncture between how the US perceives itself and how the rest of the world sees it. The deeply established tendency of the US to see itself as an intrinsic force for good because it stands for a right set of universal values, makes it unable easily, or possibly at all, to address the disjuncture between its self-perception and how others see it.
Self-righteous unilateralism does not acquire legitimacy abroad. To the extent that celebrations of US power as a good in itself (because the US is good) dominate American domestic politics, this does not inspire the US to seek grounds for legitimating its position abroad. A contributing factor here is the US tendency to demand nearly absolute security for itself. The problem for the US of transcending its own self-image is hardly new, but it has become both more difficult and more important in managing its position in the more complex world in which the US is neither so clearly on the right side of a great struggle, nor so dominant in material terms. It is unclear at this point whether Obama will be able to transcend this aspect of American politics, though it is clear that the nature of American politics makes it difficult for any president to do so. THE TURN AGAINST HEGEMONY The third constraint stems not from any particular characteristic of the US, but from the fact of unipolarity itself. Since decolonisation global international society has developed a growing disjuncture between a defining principle of legitimacy based on sovereign equality, and a practice that is substantially rooted in the hegemony of great powers. The problem is the absence of a consensual principle of hegemony with which international society might bridge this gap between its principles and its practices. A concentration of power in one actor disrupts the ideas of balance and equilibrium which are the traditional sources and conditions for legitimacy in international society. This problem would arise for any unipolar power, but it connects back to the more US-specific aspects of the legitimacy deficit. Under the Bush administration, the US lost sight of what Adam Watson calls raison de systeme (‘the belief that it pays to make the system work’), and this exacerbated the illegitimacy of hegemony in itself. Since the US looks unlikely to abandon its attachment to its own hegemony, this problem is not going to go away. If hegemony itself is illegitimate, and the US now lacks both the capabilities and attractiveness to overcome this, what lies on the near horizon is a world with no global leader. Such a world would still have several great powers influential within and beyond their regions: the EU, Russia, China, Japan, the US, possibly India and Brazil. It would also have many substantial regional powers such as South Africa, Turkey and Iran. Whether one sees a move towards a more polycentric, pluralist, and probably regionalised, world political order as desirable or worrying is a matter of choice. In such a world, global hegemony by any one power or culture will be unacceptable. Obama may hasten or delay the US exit from leadership. But the waning of the Western tide, and the re-emergence of a more multi-centred (in terms of power and wealth) and more multicultural (albeit with substantial elements of Westernization) world, mean that hegemonic global leadership whether by a single power or the West collectively is no longer going to be acceptable. The question is whether such a new world order can find the foundations for collective great power management, and whether the US can learn to live in a more pluralist international society where it is no longer the sole superpower but merely the first among equals.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states. In response to this concern, The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty authored a study titled, The Responsibility to Protect,12 calling for revisions to the understanding of sovereignty within the United Nations (UN) charter. This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. Any effort to legitimize and support a liberal world construct requires the United States to adopt a multilateral doctrine which avoids the precepts of the previous administration: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of unilateralism,”14 which have resulted in the alienation of former allies worldwide. Predominantly Muslim nations, whose citizens had previously looked to the United States as an example of representative governance, viewed the Iraq invasion as the seminal dividing action between the Western and the Islamic world. Appropriately, any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion.

Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. <u><mark>With a</u> <u>credible threat to its leading position </mark>in a unipolar global order</u>, <u><mark>the U</u></mark>nited <u><mark>S</u></mark>tates <u><mark>should adopt a</mark> grand <mark>strategy of</mark> “investment,” <mark>building legitimacy</mark> and capacity in the</u> very <u>institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construc<mark>t</u></mark> <u>of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power</u>. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 <u>investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles</u>, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, <u>China is</u> <u>already executing a strategy of expansion</u> similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. <u>The rise of peer competitors has historically</u> <u>resulted in</u> <u>regional instability</u> and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, <u>the rise of <mark>another peer competitor</u></mark> on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately <u><mark>threatens U.S. global influence</u></mark>, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 <u><mark>This decline in influence</u></mark>, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, <u><mark>threatens</mark> to result in</u> <u><mark>significant conflict</u> <u>if it</mark> ultimately <mark>leads to a paradigm shift in the</mark> ideas and <mark>principles that govern</mark> the existing <mark>world order</u></mark>. <u>A <mark>grand strategy of investment</u></mark> to address the threat of China <u><mark>requires</mark> investing in institutions</u>, addressing ungoverned states, <u>and <mark>building legitimacy</u></mark> through multilateralism. <u>The U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances</u> accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations.

Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states. In response to this concern, The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty authored a study titled, The Responsibility to Protect,12 calling for revisions to the understanding of sovereignty within the United Nations (UN) charter. This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. <u><mark>Any effort to legitimize</mark> and support <mark>a liberal world</mark> construct <mark>requires</u> <u>the U</u></mark>nited <u><mark>S</u></mark>tates <u><mark>to</u> <u>adopt a multilateral doctrine which</u><strong> <u></strong>avoids</u><strong> <u></strong>the precepts of</mark> the previous administration</u>: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of <u><mark>unilateralism</u></mark>,”14 <u><mark>which</u></mark> have <u><mark>resulted in the alienation of</mark> former <mark>allies worldwide</u></mark>.

Over the past decade, while the United States concentrated its geopolitical focus on fighting two land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, China has quietly begun implementing a strategy to emerge as the dominant imperial power within Southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean. Within the next 2 decades, China will likely replace the United States as the Asia-Pacific regional hegemonic power, if not replace us as the global superpower.1 Although China presents its rise as peaceful and non-hegemonic, its construction of naval bases in neighboring countries and military expansion in the region contradict that argument. With a credible threat to its leading position in a unipolar global order, the United States should adopt a grand strategy of “investment,” building legitimacy and capacity in the very institutions that will protect our interests in a liberal global construct of the future when we are no longer the dominant imperial power. Similar to the Clinton era's grand strategy of “enlargement,”2 investment supports a world order predicated upon a system of basic rules and principles, however, it differs in that the United States should concentrate on the institutions (i.e., United Nations, World Trade Organization, ASEAN, alliances, etc.) that support a world order, as opposed to expanding democracy as a system of governance for other sovereign nations. Despite its claims of a benevolent expansion, China is already executing a strategy of expansion similar to that of Imperial Japan's Manchukuo policy during the 1930s.3 This three-part strategy involves: “(i) (providing) significant investments in economic infrastructure for extracting natural resources; (ii) (conducting) military interventions (to) protect economic interests; and, (iii) . . . (annexing) via installation of puppet governments.”4 China has already solidified its control over neighboring North Korea and Burma, and has similarly begun more ambitious engagements in Africa and Central Asia where it seeks to expand its frontier.5 Noted political scientist Samuel P. Huntington provides further analysis of the motives behind China's imperial aspirations. He contends that “China (has) historically conceived itself as encompassing a “‘Sinic Zone'. . . (with) two goals: to become the champion of Chinese culture . . . and to resume its historical position, which it lost in the nineteenth century, as the hegemonic power in East Asia.”6 Furthermore, China holds one quarter of the world's population, and rapid economic growth will increase its demand for natural resources from outside its borders as its people seek a standard of living comparable to that of Western civilization. The rise of peer competitors has historically resulted in regional instability and one should compare “the emergence of China to the rise of. . . Germany as the dominant power in Europe in the late nineteenth century.”7 Furthermore, the rise of another peer competitor on the level of the Soviet Union of the Cold War ultimately threatens U.S. global influence, challenging its concepts of human rights, liberalism, and democracy; as well as its ability to co-opt other nations to accept them.8 This decline in influence, while initially limited to the Asia-Pacific region, threatens to result in significant conflict if it ultimately leads to a paradigm shift in the ideas and principles that govern the existing world order. A grand strategy of investment to address the threat of China requires investing in institutions, addressing ungoverned states, and building legitimacy through multilateralism. The United States must build capacity in the existing institutions and alliances accepted globally as legitimate representative bodies of the world's governments. For true legitimacy, the United States must support these institutions, not only when convenient, in order to avoid the appearance of unilateralism, which would ultimately undermine the very organizations upon whom it will rely when it is no longer the global hegemon. The United States must also address ungoverned states, not only as breeding grounds for terrorism, but as conflicts that threaten to spread into regional instability, thereby drawing in superpowers with competing interests. Huntington proposes that the greatest source of conflict will come from what he defines as one “core” nation's involvement in a conflict between another core nation and a minor state within its immediate sphere of influence.9 For example, regional instability in South Asia10 threatens to involve combatants from the United States, India, China, and the surrounding nations. Appropriately, the United States, as a global power, must apply all elements of its national power now to address the problem of weak and failing states, which threaten to serve as the principal catalysts of future global conflicts.11 Admittedly, the application of American power in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation raises issues. Experts have posed the question of whether the United States should act as the world's enforcer of stability, imposing its concepts of human rights on other states. In response to this concern, The International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty authored a study titled, The Responsibility to Protect,12 calling for revisions to the understanding of sovereignty within the United Nations (UN) charter. This commission places the responsibility to protect peoples of sovereign nations on both the state itself and, more importantly, on the international community.13 If approved, this revision will establish a precedent whereby the United States has not only the authority and responsibility to act within the internal affairs of a repressive government, but does so with global legitimacy if done under the auspices of a UN mandate. Any effort to legitimize and support a liberal world construct requires the United States to adopt a multilateral doctrine which avoids the precepts of the previous administration: “preemptive war, democratization, and U.S. primacy of unilateralism,”14 which have resulted in the alienation of former allies worldwide. Predominantly Muslim nations, whose citizens had previously looked to the United States as an example of representative governance, viewed the Iraq invasion as the seminal dividing action between the Western and the Islamic world. Appropriately, any future American interventions into the internal affairs of another sovereign nation must first seek to establish consensus by gaining the approval of a body representing global opinion, and must reject military unilateralism as a threat to that governing body's legitimacy. Despite the long-standing U.S. tradition of a liberal foreign policy since the start of the Cold War, the famous liberal leviathan, John Ikenberry, argues that “the post-9/11 doctrine of national security strategy . . . has been based on . . . American global dominance, the preventative use of force, coalitions of the willing, and the struggle between liberty and evil.”15 American foreign policy has misguidedly focused on spreading democracy, as opposed to building a liberal international order based on universally accepted principles that actually set the conditions for individual nation states to select their own system of governance. Anne-Marie Slaughter, the former Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, argues that true Wilsonian idealists “support liberal democracy, but reject the possibility of democratizing peoples . . .”16 and reject military primacy in favor of supporting a rules-based system of order. Investment in a liberal world order would also set the conditions for the United States to garner support from noncommitted regional powers (i.e., Russia, India, Japan, etc.), or “swing civilizations,” in countering China's increasing hegemonic influence.17 These states reside within close proximity to the Indian Ocean, which will likely emerge as the geopolitical focus of the American foreign policy during the 21st century, and appropriately have the ability to offset China's imperial dominance in the region.18 Critics of a liberal world construct argue that idealism is not necessary, based on the assumption that nations that trade together will not go to war with each other.19 In response, foreign affairs columnist Thomas L. Friedman rebukes their arguments, acknowledging the predicate of commercial interdependence as a factor only in the decision to go to war, and argues that while globalization is creating a new international order, differences between civilizations still create friction that may overcome all other factors and lead to conflict.20 Detractors also warn that as China grows in power, it will no longer observe “the basic rules and principles of a liberal international order,” which largely result from Western concepts of foreign relations. Ikenberry addresses this risk, citing that China's leaders already recognize that they will gain more authority within the existing liberal order, as opposed to contesting it. China's leaders “want the protection and rights that come from the international order's . . . defense of sovereignty,”21 from which they have benefitted during their recent history of economic growth and international expansion. Even if China executes a peaceful rise and the United States overestimates a Sinic threat to its national security interest, the emergence of a new imperial power will challenge American leadership in the Indian Ocean and Asia-Pacific region. That being said, it is more likely that China, as evidenced by its military and economic expansion, will displace the United States as the regional hegemonic power. Recognizing this threat now, the United States must prepare for the eventual transition and immediately begin building the legitimacy and support of a system of rules that will protect its interests later when we are no longer the world's only superpower.",10053.0,"<h4>Legitimacy of U.S. hegemony’s key to global stability---prevents great power war </h4><p><strong>Fujimoto 12 </strong>(Kevin Fujimoto 12, Lt.

The lack of real prediction systems is made abundantly clear a rise in prices is likely to instigate a response from those for whom the market was created as signalling mechanism. In turn this thus reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of the event. I bet, you see I bet, you act, I lose But this is not the most fundamental of the flaws. It merely reflects one of a deeper level. . For in the act of specification of the possible future, the job that the signalling market of derivatives is intended to achieve is already done.

It is perhaps most baldly articulated by Abramowicz, who, as we noted above, was not too bothered about the superiority of information markets' predictions, so long, it transpires, as they could still “help discipline” those who would seek to exercise freedom, either in their own name or that of others, since “the predictions of well‐functioning information markets are objective” (2003, Executive Summary). The objective here has a curious relation to the real, a revealing problematic which perhaps indicates much of what is fundamentally at stake here. For the objective is not so much the actually existing, rather it is that which can be ascertained without objection. Consider as particular exemplification of this point the following. Abramowizc, in suggesting ever more arcane ways to ensure that only fundamental traders hold sway in the final analysis of a market's arbitration, posits the possibility of a two stage information market. In the first players effectively bet on the outcome of a second, with the second open only briefly, after the close of the first, with only the payouts of the second dependent upon the verification (or not) of some future event. For Abramowizc one virtue of such a device is that “there will no longer be risk associated with real world randomness”(note 156)! It is thus not reality itself ‐ and the randomness it entails ‐ that concerns those that seek solace in prediction markets but rather certainty and reduction; a reality perhaps, but like the freedom we encountered above, only that reality which has been suitably reformulated. Made single, indisputable, and dead; not manifold, contestable and lived.¶ Such a singular representation of reality can only be a simulation, in the most pejorative of senses, that which will “always be by‐passed, confounded and exceeded by practical experience” (Baudrillard, 1990, p. 155). For there is always “irruption of that minimum of reversibility which exists in every irreversible process” (Baudrillard, 1990, p. 161), requiring our endless human intervention to secure it, to keep its mask in place and to maintain the illusion that it is outside of us and that we are not required for its maintenance. Indeed, one could go further. Our endless defence, our securing of our simulated worlds, against the ceaseless encroachment of the entropy from which they are formed is, according to Baudrillard, that which gives them their purchase upon us. They are only made interesting by this interminable maintenance requirement. The attractiveness of ordered production and prediction (see also, Cooper, 2005) is thus ironically provided by its potential to fall back into disorder, which “secretly” ruins and dismantles it “while simultaneously ensuring that a minimal continuity of pleasure traverses it, without which it would be nothing” (Baudrillard, 1990, p. 161). And for Baudrillard this means that the seduction through which all our attempts to stabilize the real world are undone “doesn't belong to the order of the real” but rather surrounds it, providing the background against which our small victories over chaos are able to shine, just as derivatives markets surround those in their underlying assets. “[S]eduction envelops the whole real process of power, as well as the whole real order of production, with endless reversibility and disaccumulation – without which neither power nor production [nor indeed prediction] would exist” (Baudrillard, 1990, p. 159, original emphases). This continual disintegration of order and manufactured form is the very ground that production, prediction and power require for their perpetuation. It is what makes these latter processes seductive.¶ The lack of real prediction associated with PAM and similar systems is made abundantly clear by Mason Richey (2005). Here PAM is indicted not for the reasons we have encountered above in the media furore surrounding its announcement but rather on more philosophical terms, entirely consonant with the line of argument we have been developing. Richey follows the logic of PAM to its self‐defeating terminal conclusion. Traders purchase a contract on PAM if they think its underlying event is more likely than its current price would suggest. En masse such trading will raise the price of that contract. But PAM is an information and prediction market. Its raison d'être is to provide a signal to those who are interested in the occurrence, or rather the prevention, of the events that underlie traded contracts. Thus a rise in prices is likely to instigate a response from those for whom the market was created as signalling mechanism. In turn this thus reduces the likelihood of the occurrence of the event. I bet, you see I bet, you act, I lose. Or as Richey (2005, p. 10) puts it: “The idea that government authorities employ the market to foresee events that they will prevent would, a priori, mute the signal”. But this is not the most fundamental of the flaws. It merely reflects one of a deeper level. And it is precisely why Hanson seems so misguided in his rendering of existing instruments as being in need of supplementation if they are to deliver prediction of a precise enough nature. For in the act of specification of the possible future, the job that the signalling market of derivatives is intended to achieve is already done. In the case of PAM, again in Richey's (2005, p. 10) words:¶ [T]he derivatives of maximal predictive interest, the impetus for the system's design, terrorism derivatives, must be explicitly articulated in order to be offered. But if the market designers can list a specific terrorist event, then they have already defined, determined, and predicted the very event that the market is designed to identify. If the market designers know which terrorist derivatives to offer, then they have already done the work of the market.¶ For Richey (2005, p. 10) then: “The system does both too little and too much”. This combination of inadequacy and excess is intimately tied to PAM's curious relation to a simulated future of an ordered, pre‐dicted, singular real. Our reading of Dillon (2004, 2006, forthcoming) suggests that such fetishization of fixation is increasingly anathema to key strands of, themselves increasingly dominant, thinking within the strategic centres of our Western security apparatus. As he pithily puts it, “‘the contingent’ has become a new order of the real”[17]. This contingent is the strategic thinking that both we, and any securing agency, actually need to engender in a world in which “human being is increasingly relativised in space and time through technologies of communication and information” (Cooper, 2005, p. 10); a world exemplified by PAM and its derivatives. What we, and they, certainly do not need to engage in is ever‐greater emplacement. For in a world ever more clearly revealed by the congenitally failing securing action of such technologies as “an inexhaustible informational remainder which, strangely, appears only to disappear” (Cooper, 2005, p. 22), such yearning for the objective, for a singular real in which to find and found ourselves is futile in the extreme. Indeed, one could go further – it is in the desire for and the violent imposition of a singular truth that most contemporary conflict is rooted. It is only a manifold real that has sufficient play of space and space of play to prevent the horrors attendant upon crusades for the truth.¶ So where do we end up? We began by invoking the range of different readings of PAM's demise and worked through the differences and similarities between them. At the same time we considered the differences and similarities between PAM and other markets. What was revealed by both of these comparisons was the tension between instrumental representation and the prior simulation upon which it depends, a tension embodied perhaps most quintessentially by markets themselves. Markets are able to reconcile the reversible imminence of simulation through endless deferral – both between different markets and their derivatives and indeed between the present and the future, so long as the latter always remains deferred and can never definitively be reached. In doing so they encompass both effect‐cause and cause‐effect. As such they are able to sustain manifold reality so long as the world keeps turning and money keeps making it go round. But what they cannot do, except in naïve and impoverished accounts, such as those of many of the protagonists we considered, is be simply resolved to one, singular reality that would arbitrate the truth, particularly the truth of a prediction. PAM's attempt to capture effect in order to enable intervention at the level of cause is forever undone by the ways in which such effect is both overly pre‐figured and by the ways in which such prefiguring, when coupled with the informative role the market is intended to perform for interventionists, acts to ensure that its signals are suppressed. Despite their myriad other disagreements, the extraction of a singular reality from the manifold is what most of our commentators seem desperate to achieve. However the divergence in their views does not thus reveal some underlying neutral core of truth from which each raps out a different line. Rather, we witness the opposite. A manifold, polyphonous world that endlessly resists and undoes any singular articulation of its nature or trajectory. Such a world allows each to tell a different story of its benefits and costs. We thus happily join in celebrating the cessation of PAM's singular call. But we would equally revel in the silencing, or rather the drowning out via cacophony, of those other monologues that brought about its end.",9905.0,"<h4>Prediction markets replace reality with an ordered, controlled simulation of it – this impulse to restrain chaos is the root cause of modern violence – state actors will ignore results and translate knowledge of the future into increasingly violent interventionism – this card literally says trying to control prediction markets is the cause of all global war – this is a spec application of knowledge as dissuasive to the aff – the alt solves by seducing the human subject into its own dissolution</h4><p>--alt solves better – seduction of systems causes chaos that solves global problems comparatively better  -- the alt is an act of seduction: not knowing the future – NOT knowing what will happen keeps actors in check – we can still do things – other countries can solve – embracing this frame of predictive arguments refuses the quest for certainty – seductive method of the 1nc endorses the same knowledge but with the possibility of chaos – the systm they preserve is a dead system – knowledge is dissuasive </p><p><strong>Aitken 11 </strong>[Rob Aitken, University of Alberta, Canada, “Financializing security: Political prediction markets and the commodification of uncertainty,” Security Dialogue April 2011 vol. 42 no. 2 123-141]</p><p><u><strong>It is perhaps most baldly articulated by</u></strong> <u><strong>Abramowicz, who, as we noted above, was not too bothered about the superiority of information markets' predictions</u></strong>, so long<u><strong>, <mark>it transpires</mark>, as <mark>they could</mark> still “<mark>help discipline</mark>” <mark>those who would seek to exercise freedom</mark>, either in their own name or that of others, <mark>since</mark> “the predictions of well‐functioning <mark>information markets</mark> <mark>are objective</mark>”</u></strong> (2003, Executive Summary). <u><strong>The objective here has a curious relation to the real, a revealing problematic which perhaps indicates much of what is fundamentally at stake here</u></strong>. <u><strong>For the objective is not so much the actually existing, rather it is that which can be ascertained without objection</u></strong>. <u><strong>Consider as particular exemplification of this point the following</u></strong>.

Any book that begins with a quote from SpongeBob SquarePants and is motored by wisdom gleaned from Fantastic Mr. Fox, Chicken Run, and Find- ing Nemo, among other animated guides to life, runs the risk of not being taken seriously. Yet this is my goal. Being taken seriously means missing out on the chance to be frivolous, promiscuous, and irrelevant. The desire to be taken seriously is precisely what compels people to follow the tried and true paths of knowledge production around which I would like to map a few detours. Indeed terms like serious and rigorous tend to be code words, in academia as well as other contexts, for disciplinary correctness; they signal a form of training and learning that confirms what is already known according to approved methods of knowing, but they do not allow for [exceptional] insights or flights of fancy. Training of any kind, in fact, is a way of refusing a kind of Benjaminian relation to knowing, a stroll down uncharted streets in the “wrong” direction (Benjamin 1996); it is precisely about staying in well-lit territories and about knowing exactly which way to go before you set out. Like many others before me, I propose that instead the goal is to lose one’s way, and indeed to be prepared to lose more than one’s way. Losing, we may agree with Elizabeth Bishop, is an art, and one “that is not too hard to master / Though it may look like a disaster” (2008: 166–167).
In the sciences, particularly physics and mathematics, there are many examples of rogue intellectuals, not all of whom are reclusive Unabomber types (although more than a few are just that), who wander off into uncharted territories and refuse the academy because the publish-or-perish pressure of academic life keeps them tethered to conventional knowledge production and its well-traveled byways. Popular mathematics books, for example, revel in stories about unconventional loners who are self- schooled and who make their own way through the world of numbers. For some kooky minds, disciplines actually get in the way of answers and theorems precisely because they offer maps of thought where intuition and blind [unscripted] fumbling might yield better results. In 2008, for example, The New Yorker featured a story about an oddball physicist who, like many ambitious physicists and mathematicians, was in hot pursuit of a grand theory, a “theory of everything.” This thinker, Garrett Lisi, had dropped out of academic physics because string theory dominated the field at that time and he thought the answers lay elsewhere. As an outsider to the discipline, writes Benjamin Wallace-Wells, Lisi “built his theory as an outsider might, relying on a grab bag of component parts: a hand-built mathematical structure, an unconventional way of describing gravity, and a mysterious mathematical entity known as E8.”1 In the end Lisi’s “theory of everything” fell short of expectations, but it nonetheless yielded a whole terrain of new questions and methods. Similarly the computer scientists who pioneered new programs to produce computer-generated imagery (CGI), as many accounts of the rise of Pixar have chronicled, were academic rejects or dropouts who created independent institutes in order to explore their dreams of animated worlds.2 These alternative cultural and academic realms, the areas beside academia rather than within it, the intellectual worlds conjured by losers, failures, dropouts, and refuseniks, often serve as the launching pad for alternatives precisely when the university cannot.
This is not a bad time to experiment with disciplinary transformation on behalf of the project of generating new forms of knowing, since the fields that were assembled over one hundred years ago to respond to new market economies and the demand for narrow expertise, as Foucault de- scribed them, are now losing relevance and failing to respond either to real-world knowledge projects or student interests. As the big disciplines begin to crumble like banks that have invested in bad securities we might ask more broadly, Do we really want to shore up the ragged boundaries of our shared interests and intellectual commitments, or might we rather take this opportunity to rethink the project of learning and thinking altogether? Just as the standardized tests that the U.S. favors as a guide to intellectual advancement in high schools tend to identify people who are good at standardized exams (as opposed to, say, intellectual visionaries), so in universities grades, exams, and knowledge of canons identify scholars with an aptitude for maintaining and conforming to the dictates of the discipline.
This book, a stroll out of the confines of conventional knowledge and into the unregulated territories of failure, loss, and unbecoming, must make a long detour around disciplines and ordinary ways of thinking. Let me explain how universities (and by implication high schools) squash rather than promote quirky and original thought. Disciplinarity, as de- fined by Foucault (1995), is a technique of modern power: it depends upon and deploys normalization, routines, convention, tradition, and regularity, and it produces experts and administrative forms of governance. The university structure that houses the disciplines and jealously guards their boundaries now stands at a crossroads, not of disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity, past and future, national and transnational; the crossroads at which the rapidly disintegrating bandwagon of disciplines, subfields, and interdisciplines has arrived offer a choice between the university as corporation and investment opportunity and the university as a new kind of public sphere with a different investment in knowledge, in ideas, and in thought and politics.
A radical take on disciplinarity and the university that presumes both the breakdown of the disciplines and the closing of gaps between fields conventionally presumed to be separated can be found in a manifesto published by Fred Moten and Stefano Harney in 2004 in Social Text titled “The University and the Undercommons: Seven Theses.” Their essay is a searing critique directed at the intellectual and the critical intellectual, the professional scholar and the “critical academic professionals.” For Moten and Harney, the critical academic is not the answer to encroaching professionalization but an extension of it, using the very same tools and legitimating strategies to become “an ally of professional education.” Moten and Harney prefer to pitch their tent with the “subversive intellectuals,” a maroon community of outcast thinkers who refuse, resist, and renege on the demands of “rigor,” “excellence,” and “productivity.” They tell us to “steal from the university,” to “steal the enlightenment for others” (112), and to act against “what Foucault called the Conquest, the unspoken war that founded, and with the force of law refounds, society” (113). And what does the undercommons of the university want to be? It wants to constitute an unprofessional force of fugitive knowers, with a set of intellectual practices not bound by examination systems and test scores. The goal for this unprofessionalization is not to abolish; in fact Moten and Harney set the fugitive intellectual against the elimination or abolition of this, the founding or refounding of that: “Not so much the abolition of prisons but the abolition of a society that could have prisons, that could have slavery, that could have the wage, and therefore not abolition as the elimination of anything but abolition as the founding of a new society” (113).
Not the elimination of anything but the founding of a new society. And why not? Why not think in terms of a different kind of society than the one that first created and then abolished slavery? The social worlds we inhabit, after all, as so many thinkers have reminded us, are not inevitable; they were not always bound to turn out this way, and what’s more, in the process of producing this reality, many other realities, fields of knowledge, and ways of being have been discarded and, to cite Fou- cault again, “disqualified.” A few visionary books, produced alongside disciplinary knowledge, show us the paths not taken. For example, in a book that itself began as a detour, Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1999), James C. Scott details the ways the modern state has run roughshod over local, customary, and undisciplined forms of knowledge in order to rationalize and simplify social, agricultural, and political practices that have profit as their primary motivation. In the process, says Scott, certain ways of [perceiving] the world are established as normal or natural, as obvious and necessary, even though they are often entirely counterintuitive and socially engineered. [Perceiving] Like a State began as a study of “why the state has always seemed to be the enemy of ‘people who move around,’” but quickly became a study of the demand by the state for legibility through the imposition of methods of standardization and uniformity (1). While Dean Spade (2008) and other queer scholars use Scott’s book to think about how we came to insist upon the documentation of gender identity on all govern- mental documentation, I want to use his monumental study to pick up some of the discarded local knowledges that are [eliminated] in the rush to bureaucratize and rationalize an economic order that privileges profit over all kinds of other motivations for being and doing.",9915.0,"<h4>The attempt to render all identity coherent and legible is a disciplinary technique which paves over, rendering illegible, modernity’s foundational Conquest – the always already ongoing war that determines what is and is not coherent, revealing and concealing ways of being in the world through the regime of sense. This is also the sum total of all other wars, all acts of violence which make the material convergence of this debate possible. In response, we are an act of queer treachery, espionage on the legalization topic. To again quote Genet, the 1AC, a “Thief’s Journal, pursuit of the Impossible Nothingness.” Join us joyously as we steal “into the void” in an affirmation of criminal knowledge, knowledge eclipsed by either side of the resolution, a joyous criminality.</h4><p>---seriousness is a disciplinary apparatus</p><p>---strive towards the unpredictable, dimly lit places – Benjaminian street walker </p><p>---this evidence has been modified to eliminate ableist metaphors</p><p><strong>Halberstam 11.<u><mark> J.

In 2008, for example, The New Yorker featured a story about an oddball physicist who, like many ambitious physicists and mathematicians, was in hot pursuit of a grand theory, a “theory of everything.” This thinker, Garrett Lisi, had dropped out of academic physics because string theory dominated the field at that time and he thought the answers lay elsewhere. <u>As an outsider to the discipline,</u> writes Benjamin Wallace-Wells, Lisi “<u>built his theory as an outsider might, relying on a grab bag of component parts: a hand-built mathematical structure, an unconventional way of describing gravity, and a mysterious mathematical entity known as E8</u>.”1 In the end Lisi’s “theory of everything” fell short of expectations, but <u>it</u> nonetheless <u>yielded a whole terrain of new questions and methods</u>.

we know the critiques Everyone knows something is wrong","(Levi, “Underpants Gnomes: A Critique of the Academic Left”, http://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2012/11/11/underpants-gnomes-a-critique-of-the-academic-left/, dml)
What I wonder is just what we’re supposed to do even if all of this is true?  What, given existing conditions, are we to do if all of this is right?  At least green consumerism, conservation, resource management, and things like carbon trading are engaging in activities that are making real differences.  From this passage– and maybe the entire text would disabuse me of this conclusion –it sounds like we are to reject all of these interventions because they remain tied to a capitalist model of production that the author (and myself) find abhorrent.  The idea seems to be that if we endorse these things we are tainting our hands and would therefore do well to reject them altogether.
The problem as I see it is that this is the worst sort of abstraction (in the Marxist sense) and wishful thinking.  Within a Marxo-Hegelian context, a thought is abstract when it ignores all of the mediations in which a thing is embedded.  For example, I understand a robust tree abstractly when I attribute its robustness, say, to its genetics alone, ignoring the complex relations to its soil, the air, sunshine, rainfall, etc., that also allowed it to grow robustly in this way.  This is the sort of critique we’re always leveling against the neoliberals.  They are abstract thinkers.  In their doxa that individuals are entirely responsible for themselves and that they completely make themselves by pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, neoliberals ignore all the mediations belonging to the social and material context in which human beings develop that play a role in determining the vectors of their life.  They ignore, for example, that George W. Bush grew up in a family that was highly connected to the world of business and government and that this gave him opportunities that someone living in a remote region of Alaska in a very different material infrastructure and set of family relations does not have.  To think concretely is to engage in a cartography of these mediations, a mapping of these networks, from circumstance to circumstance (what I call an “onto-cartography”).  It is to map assemblages, networks, or ecologies in the constitution of entities.
Unfortunately, the academic left falls prey to its own form of abstraction.  It’s good at carrying out critiques that denounce various social formations, yet very poor at proposing any sort of realistic constructions of alternatives.  This because it thinks abstractly in its own way, ignoring how networks, assemblages, structures, or regimes of attraction would have to be remade to create a workable alternative.  Here I’m reminded by the “underpants gnomes” depicted in South Park:
The underpants gnomes have a plan for achieving profit that goes like this:
Phase 1:  Collect Underpants
Phase 2:  ?
Phase 3: Profit!
They even have a catchy song to go with their work:
Well this is sadly how it often is with the academic left.  Our plan seems to be as follows:
Phase 1:  Ultra-Radical Critique
Phase 2:  ?
Phase 3:  Revolution and complete social transformation!
Our problem is that we seem perpetually stuck at phase 1 without ever explaining what is to be done at phase 2.  Often the critiques articulated at phase 1 are right, but there are nonetheless all sorts of problems with those critiques nonetheless.  In order to reach phase 3, we have to produce new collectives.  In order for new collectives to be produced, people need to be able to hear and understand the critiques developed at phase 1.  Yet this is where everything begins to fall apart.  Even though these critiques are often right, we express them in ways that only an academic with a PhD in critical theory and post-structural theory can understand.  How exactly is Adorno to produce an effect in the world if only PhD’s in the humanities can understand him?  Who are these things for?  We seem to always ignore these things and then look down our noses with disdain at the Naomi Kleins and David Graebers of the world.  To make matters worse, we publish our work in expensive academic journals that only universities can afford, with presses that don’t have a wide distribution, and give our talks at expensive hotels at academic conferences attended only by other academics.  Again, who are these things for?  Is it an accident that so many activists look away from these things with contempt, thinking their more about an academic industry and tenure, than producing change in the world?  If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, it doesn’t make a sound!  Seriously dudes and dudettes, what are you doing?
But finally, and worst of all, us Marxists and anarchists all too often act like assholes.  We denounce others, we condemn them, we berate them for not engaging with the questions we want to engage with, and we vilify them when they don’t embrace every bit of the doxa that we endorse.  We are every bit as off-putting and unpleasant as the fundamentalist minister or the priest of the inquisition (have people yet understood that Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus was a critique of the French communist party system and the Stalinist party system, and the horrific passions that arise out of parties and identifications in general?).  This type of “revolutionary” is the greatest friend of the reactionary and capitalist because they do more to drive people into the embrace of reigning ideology than to undermine reigning ideology.  These are the people that keep Rush Limbaugh in business.  Well done!
But this isn’t where our most serious shortcomings lie.  Our most serious shortcomings are to be found at phase 2.  We almost never make concrete proposals for how things ought to be restructured, for what new material infrastructures and semiotic fields need to be produced, and when we do, our critique-intoxicated cynics and skeptics immediately jump in with an analysis of all the ways in which these things contain dirty secrets, ugly motives, and are doomed to fail.  How, I wonder, are we to do anything at all when we have no concrete proposals?  We live on a planet of 6 billion people.  These 6 billion people are dependent on a certain network of production and distribution to meet the needs of their consumption.  That network of production and distribution does involve the extraction of resources, the production of food, the maintenance of paths of transit and communication, the disposal of waste, the building of shelters, the distribution of medicines, etc., etc., etc.
What are your proposals?  How will you meet these problems?  How will you navigate the existing mediations or semiotic and material features of infrastructure?  Marx and Lenin had proposals.  Do you?  Have you even explored the cartography of the problem?  Today we are so intellectually bankrupt on these points that we even have theorists speaking of events and acts and talking about a return to the old socialist party systems, ignoring the horror they generated, their failures, and not even proposing ways of avoiding the repetition of these horrors in a new system of organization.  Who among our critical theorists is thinking seriously about how to build a distribution and production system that is responsive to the needs of global consumption, avoiding the problems of planned economy, ie., who is doing this in a way that gets notice in our circles?  Who is addressing the problems of micro-fascism that arise with party systems (there’s a reason that it was the Negri & Hardt contingent, not the Badiou contingent that has been the heart of the occupy movement).   At least the ecologists are thinking about these things in these terms because, well, they think ecologically.  Sadly we need something more, a melding of the ecologists, the Marxists, and the anarchists.  We’re not getting it yet though, as far as I can tell.  Indeed, folks seem attracted to yet another critical paradigm, Laruelle.
I would love, just for a moment, to hear a radical environmentalist talk about his ideal high school that would be academically sound.  How would he provide for the energy needs of that school?  How would he meet building codes in an environmentally sound way?  How would she provide food for the students?  What would be her plan for waste disposal?  And most importantly, how would she navigate the school board, the state legislature, the federal government, and all the families of these students?  What is your plan?  What is your alternative?  I think there are alternatives.  I saw one that approached an alternative in Rotterdam.  If you want to make a truly revolutionary contribution, this is where you should start.  Why should anyone even bother listening to you if you aren’t proposing real plans?  But we haven’t even gotten to that point.  Instead we’re like underpants gnomes, saying “revolution is the answer!” without addressing any of the infrastructural questions of just how revolution is to be produced, what alternatives it would offer, and how we would concretely go about building those alternatives.  Masturbation.
“Underpants gnome” deserves to be a category in critical theory; a sort of synonym for self-congratulatory masturbation.  We need less critique not because critique isn’t important or necessary– it is –but because we know the critiques, we know the problems.  We’re intoxicated with critique because it’s easy and safe.  We best every opponent with critique.  We occupy a position of moral superiority with critique.  But do we really do anything with critique?  What we need today, more than ever, is composition or carpentry.  Everyone knows something is wrong.  Everyone knows this system is destructive and stacked against them.  Even the Tea Party knows something is wrong with the economic system, despite having the wrong economic theory.  None of us, however, are proposing alternatives.  Instead we prefer to shout and denounce.

From this passage– and maybe the entire text would disabuse me of this conclusion –<u><mark>it sounds like we are to reject</mark> all of <mark>these</mark> interventions <mark>because <strong>they remain tied to a</mark> capitalist <mark>model of production</strong> that the author</u></mark> (and myself) <u><mark>find abhorrent</u></mark>.  The idea seems to be that <u>if we endorse these things we are tainting our hands and would therefore do well to reject them altogether</u>.</p><p>The problem as I see it is <u>that <mark>this is <strong>the worst sort of abstraction</u></strong></mark> (in the Marxist sense) <u>and wishful thinking</u>.  Within a Marxo-Hegelian context, <u>a thought is abstract when it ignores all of the mediations in which a thing is embedded</u>.  For example, I understand a robust tree abstractly when I attribute its robustness, say, to its genetics alone, ignoring the complex relations to its soil, the air, sunshine, rainfall, etc., that also allowed it to grow robustly in this way.  <u>This is the sort of critique we’re always leveling against the neoliberals.  They are abstract thinkers.</u>  In their doxa that individuals are entirely responsible for themselves and that they completely make themselves by pulling themselves up by their bootstraps, <u>neoliberals ignore all the mediations belonging to the social and material context in which human beings develop that play a role in determining the vectors of their life</u>.  They ignore, for example, that George W. Bush grew up in a family that was highly connected to the world of business and government and that this gave him opportunities that someone living in a remote region of Alaska in a very different material infrastructure and set of family relations does not have.  <u>To think concretely is to engage in a cartography of these mediations, a mapping of these networks</u>, from circumstance to circumstance (what I call an “onto-cartography”).  It is to map assemblages, networks, or ecologies in the constitution of entities.</p><p>Unfortunately, <u><mark>the academic left falls prey to</mark> <strong>its own form of <mark>abstraction</strong>.  It’s good at carrying out critiques that denounce</u></mark> various <u><mark>social formations, yet</u></mark> very <u><mark>poor at proposing</mark> <strong>any sort of <mark>realistic constructions</mark> of alternatives</u></strong>.  This because <u>it thinks abstractly</u> in its own way, <u>ignoring how networks</u>, assemblages, structures, or regimes of attraction <u>would have to be remade to create a workable alternative</u>.  Here <u>I’m reminded by the “underpants gnomes” depicted in South Park</u>:</p><p><u>The underpants gnomes have a plan for achieving profit that goes like this:</p><p>Phase 1:  Collect Underpants</p><p>Phase 2:  ?</p><p>Phase 3: Profit!</p><p></u>They even have a catchy song to go with their work:</p><p>Well <u>this is</u> sadly <u>how it</u> often <u>is <strong>with the academic left</strong>.  Our plan seems to be as follows:</p><p>Phase 1:  Ultra-Radical Critique</p><p><mark>Phase 2</mark>:  ?</p><p><mark>Phase 3:</mark>  Revolution and complete social transformation!</p><p></u>Our problem is that <u><strong><mark>we seem</mark> perpetually <mark>stuck at phase 1 </strong>without</mark> ever <mark>explaining <strong>what is to be done</strong> at phase 2</mark>.</u>  Often <u>the critiques</u> articulated at phase 1 <u>are right, but there are</u> nonetheless <u>all sorts of problems</u> with those critiques nonetheless.  In order to reach phase 3, <u>we have to produce new collectives.  In order for new collectives to be produced, people need to be able to hear and understand the critiques developed</u> at phase 1.  Yet this is where everything begins to fall apart.  <u>Even though these critiques are often right, we express them in ways that <strong>only an academic</u></strong> <u>with a PhD in critical theory</u> and post-structural theory <u>can understand</u>.  How exactly is Adorno to produce an effect in the world if only PhD’s in the humanities can understand him?  Who are these things for?  We seem to always ignore these things and then look down our noses with disdain at the Naomi Kleins and David Graebers of the world.  To make matters worse, we publish our work in expensive academic journals that only universities can afford, with presses that don’t have a wide distribution, and give our talks at expensive hotels at academic conferences attended only by other academics.  Again, who are these things for?  Is it an accident that so many activists look away from these things with contempt, thinking their more about an academic industry and tenure, than producing change in the world?  <u>If a tree falls in a forest and no one is there to hear it, it doesn’t make a sound!  <strong>Seriously dudes and dudettes, what are you doing?</p><p></u></strong>But finally, and worst of all, us Marxists and anarchists all too often act like assholes.  <u>We denounce others, we condemn them, we berate them for not engaging with the questions we want to engage with</u>, and we vilify them when they don’t embrace every bit of the doxa that we endorse.  <u><mark>We are</mark> <strong>every bit <mark>as off-putting</mark> and unpleasant <mark>as the fundamentalist minister</strong></mark> or the priest of the inquisition</u> (have people yet understood that Deleuze and Guattari’s Anti-Oedipus was a critique of the French communist party system and the Stalinist party system, and the horrific passions that arise out of parties and identifications in general?).  <u><mark>This</mark> type of “revolutionary” <strong><mark>is the greatest friend of the</mark> reactionary and <mark>capitalist</strong> because they</mark> do more to <strong><mark>drive people into the embrace of reigning ideology</strong></mark> than to undermine reigning ideology</u>.  These are the people that keep Rush Limbaugh in business.  Well done!</p><p>But this isn’t where our most serious shortcomings lie.  Our most serious shortcomings are to be found at phase 2.  <u><mark>We</u></mark> almost <u><strong><mark>never make concrete proposals for how things ought to be restructured</u></strong>,</mark> for what new material infrastructures and semiotic fields need to be produced, and <u><mark>when we do,</mark> our critique-intoxicated cynics and <mark>skeptics</mark> immediately <mark>jump in with an analysis of all the ways in which these things</mark> contain dirty secrets</u>, ugly motives, <u>and <mark>are doomed to fail</mark>.  How</u>, I wonder, <u>are we to do anything at all when we have no concrete proposals?</u>  We live on a planet of 6 billion people.  These <u>6 billion people are dependent on a certain network of production and distribution</u> to meet the needs of their consumption.  That network of production and distribution does involve the extraction of resources, the production of food, the maintenance of paths of transit and communication, the disposal of waste, the building of shelters, the distribution of medicines, etc., etc., etc.</p><p>What are your proposals?  <u>How will you meet these problems?  <mark>How will you navigate</mark> the existing mediations or semiotic and <mark>material features of infrastructure?</u></mark>  Marx and Lenin had proposals.  Do you?  Have you even explored the cartography of the problem?  Today <u>we are so intellectually bankrupt on these points that <mark>we</mark> even <mark>have theorists</mark> speaking of events</u> and acts <u>and <mark>talking about a return to the old</mark> socialist party <mark>systems, <strong>ignoring the horror they generated</u></strong></mark>, their failures, <u><mark>and <strong>not</mark> even <mark>proposing ways of avoiding the repetition</mark> of these horrors</strong> in a new system of organization.  Who among our critical theorists is thinking seriously about how to build a distribution and production system that is responsive to the needs of global consumption</u>, avoiding the problems of planned economy, ie., who is doing this in a way that gets notice in our circles?  Who is addressing the problems of micro-fascism that arise with party systems (there’s a reason that it was the Negri & Hardt contingent, not the Badiou contingent that has been the heart of the occupy movement).   At least the ecologists are thinking about these things in these terms because, well, they think ecologically.  Sadly we need something more, a melding of the ecologists, the Marxists, and the anarchists.  We’re not getting it yet though, as far as I can tell.  Indeed, folks seem attracted to yet another critical paradigm, Laruelle.</p><p>I would love, just for a moment, to hear a radical environmentalist talk about his ideal high school that would be academically sound.  How would he provide for the energy needs of that school?  How would he meet building codes in an environmentally sound way?  How would she provide food for the students?  What would be her plan for waste disposal?  And most importantly, how would she navigate the school board, the state legislature, the federal government, and all the families of these students?  <u>What is your plan?  What is your alternative?</u>  I think there are alternatives.  I saw one that approached an alternative in Rotterdam.  <u>If you want to make a truly revolutionary contribution, this is where you should start.  <mark>Why should anyone even bother listening to you if you aren’t proposing real plans?</u></mark>  But we haven’t even gotten to that point.  Instead <u><strong><mark>we’re</mark> like <mark>underpants gnomes</strong>, saying “revolution is the answer!” without addressing </mark>any of the infrastructural questions of <strong>just <mark>how revolution is to be produced</strong>, what alternatives it would offer, and <strong>how we would concretely go about building those alternatives</u>.</strong></mark>  <u><strong>Masturbation</u></strong>.</p><p>“<u>Underpants gnome” deserves to be a category in critical theory</u>; a sort of synonym for self-congratulatory masturbation.  <u>We need less critique <strong>not because critique isn’t important or necessary</u></strong>– it is –<u>but <strong>because <mark>we know the critiques</u></strong></mark>, we know the problems.  <u>We’re intoxicated with critique because it’s easy and safe</u>.  We best every opponent with critique.  We occupy a position of moral superiority with critique.  <u>But do we really do anything with critique?

Everyone knows this system is destructive and stacked against them.  Even the Tea Party knows something is wrong with the economic system, despite having the wrong economic theory.  <u>None of us</u>, however, <u>are proposing alternatives.

(National Office of the Black Panther Party, 1995, p. 220) For well more than two decades, we have witnessed the jubilant liberal and conservative pronouncements of the demise of socialism. Concomitantly, history’s presumed failure to defang existing capitalist relations has been read by many self-identified “radicals” as an advertisement for capitalism’s inevitability. As a result, the chorus refrain of TINA sung by liberals and conservatives has been buttressed by the symphony of post-Marxist voices recommending that we give socialism a decent burial and move on. Within this context, to speak of the promise of Marx and socialism may appear anachronistic, even naive, especially because the post-al intellectual vanguard has presumably demonstrated the folly of doing so. Yet we defiantly believe that the chants of TINA must be combated for they offer as a fait accompli something that progressive leftists should refuse to countenance—namely the triumph of globalized capitalism and its political bedfellow, neoliberalism, which have worked together to naturalize suffering and obliterate hope. The grotesque conditions that inspired Marx to pen his original critiques of capitalism are present and flourishing. In fact, the inequalities of wealth and the gross imbalances of power that  exist today are leading to abuses that exceed those encountered in Marx’s day (Greider, 1998, p. 39). These are the circumstances of our times—circumstances that require an unrelenting critique of capitalism and an oppositional politics capable of confronting capitalist universality. These are realities that require something more than the liberal pluralism of difference politics, something more than the cries of post-Marxists who would have us relegate socialism to the rag-and-bone shop of historical memory and mummify Marxism along with Lenin’s corpse.We concur with Amin (1998) who claimed that the politics of historical inevitability sewn into the neoliberal undergarments of TINA supporters must be defied and revealed as absurd and criminal and who put the challenge we face in no uncertain terms: Humanity may let itself be led by capitalism’s logic to a fate of collective suicide, or it may pave the way for an alternative humanist project of global socialism. The urgency that animates Amin’s clarion call for a collective socialist vision necessitates challenging the questionable assumptions that have come to constitute the core of “radical” theory and practice. In terms of effecting change, what is needed is a cogent understanding of the systemic nature of exploitation and oppression based on the precepts of a radical critique of political economy. Seldom before has a Marxian analysis of capitalism and class rule been so desperately needed. That is not to say that everything Marx anticipated has come true, for that is clearly not the case.Nonetheless,Marx’s enduring relevance lies in his indictment of capitalism that continues to wreak havoc in the lives of most global citizens. Rather than jettisoning Marx, leftists must continue to engage his oeuvre and extrapolate from it that which is useful pedagogically, theoretically, and, most important, politically in light of the challenges that confront us in defeating capitalism and instituting a socialist alternative. The task for progressive intellectuals is to seize the moment and plant the seeds for a political agenda that is grounded in an array of historical possibilities, is informed by a vision committed to overcoming exploitative conditions, and incorporates Marx’s notion of “unity in difference” in which people share widely common class and material interests. Such an understanding extends far beyond the realm of theory, for the manner in which we choose to interpret and explore the social world and the concepts and frameworks we use to express our sociopolitical understandings represents more than just a Faustian infatuation with abstract categories. They imply intentions, organizational practices, and political agendas. Identifying class analysis as the basis for our understandings and class struggle as the basis for political transformation implies something quite different than constructing a sense of political agency around issues of race, ethnicity, gender, and so forth. Contrary to “Shakespeare’s assertion that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet,” it should be clear that this is not the case in political matters. Rather, in politics “the essence of the flower lies in the name by which it is called” (Bannerji, 2000, p. 41). For the vast majority of people today—people of all “racial classifications or identities, all genders and sexual orientations,” the common frame of reference  arcing across “difference,”—the “concerns and aspirations that are most widely shared are those that are rooted in the common experience of everyday life shaped and constrained by political economy” (Reed, 2000, p. xxvii).Does this mean that race should be reduced solely to a question of class or that we should ignore racism and center our efforts on class struggle? No. We acknowledge, along with Marable (2001), that socialist movements have been held in suspicion or rejected outright by the Black community because of “the manifestation of racism by white workers, labor unions, and white ‘progressives’ ” (p. 204). Furthermore, “white democratic socialists still seldom respect or even comprehend the African American’s legitimate claim to unique national identity, culture, and tradition of struggle” (p. 204). Here, we support the perspective of C. L. R. James who wrote, The race question is subsidiary to the class question in politics, and to think of imperialism in terms of race is disastrous. But to neglect the racial factor as merely incidental is an error only less grave than to make it fundamental. (as cited in Marable, 2001, p. 205) Although post-Marxist advocates of the politics of difference suggest that the project of class struggle is outdated, we would argue that the categories they have typically employed are now losing their usefulness, particularly in light of actual social conditions and movements. “The day-to-day realities of corporate hegemony” are increasingly suggesting “promising possibilities for a shift beyond the difficulties” of identity and difference politics, for the “experience of multiple oppressions no longer requires multiple theories of oppression because corporations multiply oppress” (Starr, 2000, pp. 166-167). The current anticorporate globalization movements have redefined “enemies in ways that do not depend on identity as the basis of understanding and allies in ways that do not depend on a subtle and fragile ‘politics of difference.’ . . . What is at stake is political economic” (Starr, 2000, pp. 166-167). As such, notions of difference and identity “may no longer be the most important organizing principle for social movements”; rather, they “speak with clarity about the enemy,” that is, neoliberal, globalized corporate capitalism (Starr, 2000, pp. 166-167). The mantra “another world is possible” has become the animating theme of recent global protests. It appears that those people struggling against tear gas, police batons, and rubber bullets in the streets of Seattle, Genoa, Prague, and Quebec City have not read about TINA, the end of grand narratives of emancipation, or the decentering of capitalism. It seems as though the struggle for basic survival and some semblance of human dignity in the mean streets of the dystopian metropolis does not permit much time or opportunity to read the heady proclamations emanating from the post-al academy. As E. P. Thompson (1978) once remarked, sometimes “experience walks in without knocking at the door, and announces deaths, crises of subsistence, trench warfare, unemployment, inflation, genocide” (p. 11). History, to paraphrase Thompson  (p. 25), does not seem to be following theory’s script. This, of course, does not mean that socialism will inevitably come about; yet a sense of its burgeoning promise permeates contemporary protest movements (Zinn, 2000). Committed Left intellectuals must work to cultivate a democratic socialist vision that refuses to forget the “wretched of the earth,” the children of the damned, and the victims of the culture of silence—a task that requires more than abstruse convolutions and striking ironic poses in the agnostic arena of signifying practices. Socialism in the United States remains a theory of social and economic justice rooted in a ruthless critique of capitalism and exploitation. It must be made into a living reality opposed to liberal democracy, which only serves to facilitate the reproduction of capital. In advancing this struggle, we advocate the building of a multiracial, gender-balanced, and anti-imperialist social movement dedicated to opposing racism, capitalism (both in private property and state property forms), sexism, heterosexism, hierarchies based on social class, as well as other forms of oppression. Whatever the misunderstandings or confusion surrounding the notion of socialism—largely bound up with a mistaken identification ofMarxism with its opposite, Stalinism—the democratic and internationalist principles of socialism need to be reinvigorated among those serious about resisting the domination of capital and social relations that create inequality and oppression. Socialism today, undoubtedly, runs against the grain of received wisdom, but its vision of a vastly improved and freer arrangement of social relations beckons on the horizon. Its unwritten text is nascent in the present even as it exists among the fragments of history and the shards of distant memories.

Rather, in politics “the essence of the flower lies in the name by which it is called” (Bannerji, 2000, p. 41). <u>For the vast majority of people today</u>—people of all “racial classifications or identities, all genders and sexual orientations,” <u>the common frame of reference  arcing across “difference</u>,”—the “concerns and aspirations that are most widely shared are those that <u>are rooted in the common experience of everyday life shaped and constrained by political economy</u>” (Reed, 2000, p. xxvii).<u><mark>Does this mean</mark> that <strong><mark>race should be reduced solely to a question of class</u></strong></mark> or that we should ignore racism and center our efforts on class struggle? <u><mark>No. We acknowledge</u></mark>, along with Marable (2001), <u><mark>that socialist movements have been held in suspicion </mark>or rejected outright by the Black community</u> <u><mark>because of</u> </mark>“the manifestation of <u><mark>racism by </mark>white <mark>workers,</u> </mark>labor <u><mark>unions, and white ‘progressives’</u> </mark>” (p. 204). <u><mark>Furthermore, “white democratic socialists still seldom respect or even comprehend </mark>the</u> <u>African American’s legitimate claim to unique</u> national identity, <u><mark>culture, and tradition of struggle</u></mark>” (p. 204). Here, we support the perspective of C. L. R. James who wrote, <u>The race question is subsidiary to the class question in politics, and to think of imperialism in terms of race is disastrous. But <mark>to neglect the racial factor as <strong>merely incidental</strong> is an error</mark> only less grave than to make it fundamental</u>. (as cited in Marable, 2001, p. 205) <u><mark>Although</u> </mark>post-Marxist <u><mark>advocates of the politics of difference suggest</u> </mark>that the project of <u><mark>class struggle is outdated, we</u> </mark>would <u><mark>argue that</u> </mark>the categories they have typically employed are now losing their usefulness, particularly in light of actual social conditions and movements. “<u>The day-to-day realities of corporate hegemony” are increasingly suggesting </u>“promising possibilities for<u> a shift beyond the difficulties” of identity and difference politics, for the “experience of multiple oppressions no longer requires multiple theories of oppression because corporations multiply oppress</u>” (Starr, 2000, pp. 166-167). The <u>current anticorporate globalization movements have redefined “enemies in ways that do not depend on identity as the basis of understanding and allies in ways that do not depend on a subtle and fragile ‘politics of difference.’ . . . What is at stake is political economic”</u> (Starr, 2000, pp. 166-167). As such, <u><mark>notions of difference </mark>and identity “<mark>may no longer be the </mark>most important <mark>organizing principle for social movements”; rather, they “speak with <strong>clarity about the enemy,”</strong> that is, neolib</mark>eral, globalized corporate capitalism </u>(Starr, 2000, pp. 166-167). The mantra “another world is possible” has become the animating theme of recent global protests. It appears that those <u>people struggling against tear gas, police batons, and rubber bullets</u> in the streets of Seattle, Genoa, Prague, and Quebec City <u>have not read about TINA, the end of grand narratives of emancipation, or the decentering of capitalism</u>. It seems as though the struggle for basic survival and some semblance of human dignity in the mean streets of the dystopian metropolis does not permit much time or opportunity to read the heady proclamations emanating from the post-al academy. As E. P. Thompson (1978) once remarked, sometimes “experience walks in without knocking at the door, and announces deaths, crises of subsistence, trench warfare, unemployment, inflation, genocide” (p. 11). <u>History</u>, to paraphrase Thompson  (p. 25<u>), does not seem to be following theory’s script</u>. <u>This,</u> of course, <u>does not mean that socialism will inevitably come about; yet a sense of its burgeoning promise permeates contemporary protest movements</u> (Zinn, 2000). Committed <u>Left intellectuals must work to cultivate a democratic socialist vision that refuses to forget the “wretched of the earth,”</u> the children of the damned, and the victims of the culture of silence—<u>a task that requires more than abstruse convolutions and striking ironic poses in the agnostic arena of signifying practices</u>. <u><mark>Socialism in the U</u></mark>nited <u><mark>S</u></mark>tates <u><mark>remains</mark> a theory of social and economic justice <mark>rooted in</mark> a <mark>ruthless critique of</mark> capitalism and <mark>exploitation.

In advancing this struggle, <u>we advocate the building of a multiracial, gender-balanced, and anti-imperialist social movement dedicated to opposing racism, capitalism</u> (both in private property and state property forms), <u>sexism, heterosexism, hierarchies based on social class, as well as other forms of oppression. Whatever the misunderstandings or confusion surrounding the notion of socialism</u>—largely bound up with a mistaken identification ofMarxism with its opposite, Stalinism—<u>the democratic and internationalist principles of socialism need to be reinvigorated among those serious about resisting the domination of capital and social relations that create inequality and oppression. Socialism today, undoubtedly, runs against the grain of received wisdom, but its vision of a vastly improved and freer arrangement of social relations beckons on the horizon. Its unwritten text is nascent in the present even as it exists among the fragments of history and the shards of distant memories. Its promise needs to be redeemed. </p></u>",r6 neg v. usc os,K,K outweighs,444810,3,18339,./documents/ndtceda14/Michigan/PaAl/Michigan-Pappas-Allen-Neg-Kentucky-Round6.docx,568568,N,Kentucky,6,USC OS,Brad Meloche,,ndtceda14/Michigan/PaAl/Michigan-Pappas-Allen-Neg-Kentucky-Round6.docx,,48712,PaAl,Michigan PaAl,,Al.....,Pa.....,El.....,Al.....,18792,Michigan,Michigan,,,1004,ndtceda14,NDT/CEDA 2014-15,2014,cx,college,2

they don't want to talk about it, for fear of losing support","Marijuana legal reform has made great strides over the past few years. Four states are now allowing their citizens to freely use recreational marijuana. Washington D.C. -- the seat of the federal government itself -- has joined Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state in fully legalizing marijuana. Almost half the states (23 of them) have legalized medical use of marijuana, and an additional dozen have allowed for heavily-restricted medical use of some form of the plant or another. That adds up to over seventy percent of America. Yet the federal laws have not budged an inch, and remain Draconian in their condemnation of any use of marijuana.
Change will come to federal law. That is almost assured, at this point. More and more states will likely jump on the bandwagon of recreational legalization in the 2016 elections and beyond. Sooner or later, the federal position will have to change. Three senators have just introduced legislation to do precisely that, although the chances for this particular bill being enacted are a long way from being assured. Whether it succeeds or not, though, change will indeed come at some point, and when it does it may look a lot like this bill.
The bill (S.683) is serious in its scope. It would not make radical changes, and is in fact rather incremental in nature. Even if enacted, future change would likely become necessary at some point, but it would still represent a good first step on the path toward dismantling the federal ""War On Weed"" that has been raging for approximately a century now. At this point, however, the incremental nature of the bill is actually encouraging, because it could place the bill in the realm of the politically possible (where a more-radical bill might fail). For instance, a different bill (H.1013) was also just introduced, in the House, which is far more sweeping in nature (it would essentially just hand marijuana off to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives), but it's not currently getting as much attention because its chances of passage are likely lower than the Senate bill's. To put it another way, the House bill represents the end of the road for legal reform of marijuana laws, but politicians aren't likely to vote for it before first taking a few intermediate steps. Having all laws treat marijuana similarly to alcohol is indeed the ultimate goal, but it's a pretty big leap to expect all at once.
The last few years have seen a monumental shift in the way the federal Justice Department sets its priorities when it comes to marijuana. During the first few years of the Obama administration, Attorney General Eric Holder vacillated on how fast to revamp the War On Weed, sometimes taking a tentative step forward, and sometimes taking a few big steps backwards. Since the president was re-elected, however, Holder has pushed the justice system towards reform in a much bigger way. This is to his credit, and to Obama's credit. But these changes in priority are merely departmental policy -- they could be reversed or otherwise undone by any future president with a different set of priorities. To truly reform the federal government's attitude requires encoding reform into federal law.
Seen as a whole, the current federal attitude towards marijuana can truly be described as ""doublethink."" There are so many contradictions in the government's attitude that they are indeed hard to accurately count. George Orwell famously defined his term: ""Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them."" Consider that the federal government itself began providing legal joints to glaucoma patients as medicine over three decades ago, but still maintains that marijuana ""has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States."" Even though 35 states' laws now allow it.
Consider that the last three presidents have admitted to using marijuana recreationally, as well as plenty of other politicians now involved in running the country. But a legal conviction for using marijuana has meant since the ""Just say no"" 1980s that students are declared ineligible for federal student aid. So much for rehabilitation and making something of your life, eh? At least for those that get caught (none of our past three presidents ever got caught, obviously, on their long path to the White House).
Consider also that the federal government maintains that marijuana cannot possibly be safe medicine, because absolutely no proper studies exist showing its medical effectiveness. At the same time, the federal government would routinely deny permission to any scientist who wanted to perform a study which didn't have the pre-ordained conclusion ""marijuana is bad."" There are no studies showing marijuana can be good, but every study that attempts to do so is denied. Doublethink, or perhaps (to use another literary reference) just a big Catch-22. The president's ""drug czar"" cannot -- by law -- ever publicly even hint that the federal government's position on marijuana is wrong. So much for science, and for the First Amendment. But sometimes, with doublethink, you have to forcibly impose it so it doesn't show any cracks in public. So the drug czar sits before Congress and has to take the position that marijuana is more dangerous than crystal meth -- which is not just doublethink, but downright insane.
Federal law needs changing. Even now, with a mostly-sympathetic attorney general, individual U.S. attorneys (federal prosecutors) can with impunity wage an ever-harsher war not just on businesses and individuals who are following their state's laws, but also on everyone on the periphery of such business activities. This includes threats to landlords who own property where marijuana dispensaries operate. Threats to newspapers who print ads for doctors who write medical marijuana prescriptions. Threats to the doctors themselves. Threats to banks who want to serve such customers as marijuana businesses. Threats to sheriffs and other law enforcement officers who have implemented commonsense regulations for state-legal marijuana growers. The list of abuses is indeed a long one -- too long to adequately cover here.
The federal government's tax code currently treats marijuana businesses (the fastest-growing industry in America right now, according to many) differently than any other business legally operating. Marijuana businesses cannot -- like every other business in the country routinely does -- write off their operating costs on their federal taxes. They are taxed not on their profit (revenues minus salaries paid, rent paid and all the other costs of doing business), but on their total revenues. This makes no sense whatsoever, but it's the current tax law.
A lot of marijuana laws on the books are nothing more than hangovers from the most-fervent days of the Drug War. During the Nancy Reagan years, Republicans routinely painted Democrats as ""soft on crime,"" as a political wedge. Democrats responded by bending over backwards to prove that they were just as fanatic drug warriors as the Republicans. The result was mandatory minimum sentencing guidelines and a whole lot of other ""we're so tough on crime"" legislation. The result was also an explosion in America's prison population.
Senators Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Rand Paul have now introduced a bill to change the worst aspects of federal marijuana doublethink. It would allow, for instance, doctors to prescribe marijuana without fear of federal prosecution. It would remove some of the federal roadblocks to scientific studies, and it would make it easier to procure legal marijuana to use in those studies. It would allow returning soldiers to legally be prescribed marijuana to relieve post-traumatic stress disorder. It would allow banks to serve state-legal marijuana businesses so they wouldn't have to operate on a cash-only basis. Most important of all, it would change the federal designation of marijuana from ""Schedule I"" to ""Schedule II"" -- meaning official recognition that marijuana ""has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.""
All of these changes are long overdue. The bill S.683 would introduce some much-needed sanity into federal marijuana laws. It would begin the process of dismantling the long and completely futile federal War On Weed.
What is interesting is that political support for these changes might come from an unexpected direction. While Rand Paul is pretty libertarian (the Libertarian Party has long advocated liberalizing drug laws), other Republican presidential candidates have expressed some support as well (since it fits in with their concept of ""states' rights""). Democrats are the ones who may be following the Republican lead on the issue, if they don't watch out. Right now, most Democrats are, on marijuana, approximately where they were six years ago on gay marriage -- they really don't want to talk about it, for fear of losing voter support. This timidity is likely to be echoed by the Democratic nominee in 2016, who may cautiously offer vague words of support but likely won't seek to make it a prominent plank in his or her platform.
The new Senate bill is very well thought out. It is not merely a vehicle for legislative protest, doomed to failure. It comprehensively changes the worst doublethink in the federal legal code, and provides a way for the entire country to rationally move forward on marijuana reform. Granted, even if enacted and signed into law, further reforms will be necessary in the future. But it is a solid first step on the right path.
Anyone interested in seeing marijuana reform happen should right now be asking their own senators why they aren't co-sponsors of this commonsense legislation. Call them up, email them, go visit a town hall and publicly ask them to support S.683. As seventy percent of the states have already shown, when the people lead on marijuana reform, the leaders will eventually follow.

One year later, how much has the world really changed? Some banks have gone bust The predictions of collapse have not materialized
there's a fundamental reason why we have not faced global collapse It is the same reason that we weathered 1987 1992 1997 1998 2000 The system is inherently more resilient than we think. The world today is characterized by three major forces for stability, each reinforcing the other
The first is great-power peace. Since the end of the Cold War, the world's major powers have not competed with each other in geomilitary terms. This is extremely rare in history clash of superpower proxies caused enormous bloodshed and instability Nothing like that is happening today
Peace allows for the possibility of a stable economic life and trade
This consensus enabled the expansion of the global economy That means everyone is invested in the same system. no one is suggesting that they abandon free-market capitalism and return to communism.
The second force for stability is the victory over inflation Severe inflation can be far more disruptive than a recession, because while recessions rob you of better jobs inflation robs you of what you have now by destroying your saving In the 1970s, hyperinflation led to the destruction of the middle class, which was the background condition for political dramas of the era—coups in Latin America, the suspension of democracy in India, the overthrow of the shah in Iran. But then in 1979, the tide began to turn when Paul Volcker took over the U.S. Federal Reserve and waged war against inflation. Over two decades, central banks managed to decisively beat down the beast. At this point, only one country in the world suffers from -hyperinflation: Zimbabwe. Low inflation allows people, businesses, and governments to plan for the future, a key precondition for stability.
the third force is technological connectivity. Today the information revolution has created a much more deeply connected global system.
The majority of the world's nations have learned some basic lessons about political well-being and wealth creation Despite all the turmoil of the past year, it's important to remember that more people have been lifted out of poverty over the last two decades than in the preceding 10","Faith in the American model had collapsed
predictions of collapse have not materialized
we weathered 87 92 98, and 2000. The system is inherently more resilient than we think.
superpower proxies caused enormous bloodshed Nothing like that is happening

The second force is victory over inflation hyperinflation was the condition for political dramas
more people have been lifted out of poverty over the last two decades than in the preceding 10","One year ago, the world seemed as if it might be coming apart. The global financial system, which had fueled a great expansion of capitalism and trade across the world, was crumbling. All the certainties of the age of globalization—about the virtues of free markets, trade, and technology—were being called into question. Faith in the American model had collapsed. The financial industry had crumbled. Once-roaring emerging markets like China, India, and Brazil were sinking. Worldwide trade was shrinking to a degree not seen since the 1930s.
Pundits whose bearishness had been vindicated predicted we were doomed to a long, painful bust, with cascading failures in sector after sector, country after country. In a widely cited essay that appeared in The Atlantic this May, Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, wrote: ""The conventional wisdom among the elite is still that the current slump 'cannot be as bad as the Great Depression.' This view is wrong. What we face now could, in fact, be worse than the Great Depression.""
Others predicted that these economic shocks would lead to political instability and violence in the worst-hit countries. At his confirmation hearing in February, the new U.S. director of national intelligence, Adm. Dennis Blair, cautioned the Senate that ""the financial crisis and global recession are likely to produce a wave of economic crises in emerging-market nations over the next year."" Hillary Clinton endorsed this grim view. And she was hardly alone. Foreign Policy ran a cover story predicting serious unrest in several emerging markets.
Of one thing everyone was sure: nothing would ever be the same again. Not the financial industry, not capitalism, not globalization.
One year later, how much has the world really changed? Well, Wall Street is home to two fewer investment banks (three, if you count Merrill Lynch). Some regional banks have gone bust. There was some turmoil in Moldova and (entirely unrelated to the financial crisis) in Iran. Severe problems remain, like high unemployment in the West, and we face new problems caused by responses to the crisis—soaring debt and fears of inflation. But overall, things look nothing like they did in the 1930s. The predictions of economic and political collapse have not materialized at all.
A key measure of fear and fragility is the ability of poor and unstable countries to borrow money on the debt markets. So consider this: the sovereign bonds of tottering Pakistan have returned 168 percent so far this year. All this doesn't add up to a recovery yet, but it does reflect a return to some level of normalcy. And that rebound has been so rapid that even the shrewdest observers remain puzzled. ""The question I have at the back of my head is 'Is that it?' "" says Charles Kaye, the co-head of Warburg Pincus. ""We had this huge crisis, and now we're back to business as usual?""
This revival did not happen because markets managed to stabilize themselves on their own. Rather, governments, having learned the lessons of the Great Depression, were determined not to repeat the same mistakes once this crisis hit. By massively expanding state support for the through central banks and national treasuries—they buffered the worst of the damage. (Whether they made new mistakes in the process remains to be seen.) The extensive social safety nets that have been established across the industrialized world also cushioned the pain felt by many. Times are still tough, but things are nowhere near as bad as in the 1930s, when governments played a tiny role in national economies.
It's true that the massive state interventions of the past year may be fueling some new bubbles: the cheap cash and government guarantees provided to banks, companies, and consumers have fueled some irrational exuberance in stock and bond markets. Yet these rallies also demonstrate the return of confidence, and confidence is a very powerful economic force. When John Maynard Keynes described his own prescriptions for economic growth, he believed government action could provide only a temporary fix until the real motor of the economy started cranking again—the animal spirits of investors, consumers, and companies seeking risk and profit.
Beyond all this, though, I believe there's a fundamental reason why we have not faced global collapse in the last year. It is the same reason that we weathered the stock-market crash of 1987, the recession of 1992, the Asian crisis of 1997, the Russian default of 1998, and the tech-bubble collapse of 2000. The current global economic system is inherently more resilient than we think. The world today is characterized by three major forces for stability, each reinforcing the other and each historical in nature.
The first is the spread of great-power peace. Since the end of the Cold War, the world's major powers have not competed with each other in geomilitary terms. There have been some political tensions, but measured by historical standards the globe today is stunningly free of friction between the mightiest nations. This lack of conflict is extremely rare in history. You would have to go back at least 175 years, if not 400, to find any prolonged period like the one we are living in. The number of people who have died as a result of wars, civil conflicts, and terrorism over the last 30 years has declined sharply (despite what you might think on the basis of overhyped fears about terrorism). And no wonder—three decades ago, the Soviet Union was still funding militias, governments, and guerrillas in dozens of countries around the world. And the United States was backing the other side in every one of those places. That clash of superpower proxies caused enormous bloodshed and instability: recall that 3 million people died in Indochina alone during the 1970s. Nothing like that is happening today.
Peace is like oxygen, Harvard's Joseph Nye has written. When you don't have it, it's all you can think about, but when you do, you don't appreciate your good fortune. Peace allows for the possibility of a stable economic life and trade. The peace that flowed from the end of the Cold War had a much larger effect because it was accompanied by the discrediting of socialism. The world was left with a sole superpower but also a single workable economic model—capitalism—albeit with many variants from Sweden to Hong Kong.
This consensus enabled the expansion of the global economy; in fact, it created for the first time a single world economy in which almost all countries across the globe were participants. That means everyone is invested in the same system. Today, while the nations of Eastern Europe might face an economic crisis, no one is suggesting that they abandon free-market capitalism and return to communism. In fact, around the world you see the opposite: even in the midst of this downturn, there have been few successful electoral appeals for a turn to socialism or a rejection of the current framework of political economy. Center-right parties have instead prospered in recent elections throughout the West.
The second force for stability is the victory—after a decades-long struggle—over the cancer of inflation. Thirty-five years ago, much of the world was plagued by high inflation, with deep social and political consequences. Severe inflation can be far more disruptive than a recession, because while recessions rob you of better jobs and wages that you might have had in the future, inflation robs you of what you have now by destroying your savings. In many countries in the 1970s, hyperinflation led to the destruction of the middle class, which was the background condition for many of the political dramas of the era—coups in Latin America, the suspension of democracy in India, the overthrow of the shah in Iran. But then in 1979, the tide began to turn when Paul Volcker took over the U.S. Federal Reserve and waged war against inflation. Over two decades, central banks managed to decisively beat down the beast. At this point, only one country in the world suffers from -hyperinflation: Zimbabwe. Low inflation allows people, businesses, and governments to plan for the future, a key precondition for stability.
Political and economic stability have each reinforced the other. And the third force that has underpinned the resilience of the global system is technological connectivity. Globalization has always existed in a sense in the modern world, but until recently its contours were mostly limited to trade: countries made goods and sold them abroad. Today the information revolution has created a much more deeply connected global system.
Managers in Arkansas can work with suppliers in Beijing on a real-time basis. The production of almost every complex manufactured product now involves input from a dozen countries in a tight global supply chain. And the consequences of connectivity go well beyond economics. Women in rural India have learned through satellite television about the independence of women in more modern countries. Citizens in Iran have used cell phones and the Internet to connect to their well-wishers beyond their borders. Globalization today is fundamentally about knowledge being dispersed across our world.
This diffusion of knowledge may actually be the most important reason for the stability of the current system. The majority of the world's nations have learned some basic lessons about political well-being and wealth creation. They have taken advantage of the opportunities provided by peace, low inflation, and technology to plug in to the global system. And they have seen the indisputable results. Despite all the turmoil of the past year, it's important to remember that more people have been lifted out of poverty over the last two decades than in the preceding 10. Clear-thinking citizens around the world are determined not to lose these gains by falling for some ideological chimera, or searching for a worker's utopia. They are even cautious about the appeals of hypernationalism and war. Most have been there, done that. And they know the price.",10093.0,"<h4>Economies are resilient, even if the American model erodes</h4><p><strong>Zakaria 2009</strong> – PhD in political science from Harvard, editor of Newsweek International, former managing editor of Foreign Affairs (12/12, Fareed, Newsweek, “The Secrets of Stability”, http://www.newsweek.com/id/226425/page/2, WEA)</p><p><u>One year ago, the world seemed</u> as if <u>it might be coming apart</u>.

According to the Trafficking Protocol, if any of the ""means"" elements are present, then a victim's consent is irrelevant.229 In the context of medical procedures, the consent of a victim would be irrelevant because ""[a]n uninformed decision to follow the recommendation or suggestion of a medical professional is in effect a choice coerced by the medical professional., 230 American courts have also held that consent cannot exist when valuable information is withheld from the patient. 231 Securing consent without providing the patient with adequate information constitutes redressable negligence232 and surgery without informed consent has long been recognized as battery .233
When a patient has given full informed consent, three main elements are present: disclosure, capacity, and voluntariness. 234 The duty of disclosure arises from an individual's right to selfdetermination, which requires one to know the truth and receive all information related to the decision. 235 A ""reasonable patient"" standard is applied and looks to what a reasonable patient would want to know in order to make an informed medical decision. This usually centers on the procedure being fully explained, as well as disclosing any 236 anticipated risks and consequences.
Capacity refers to a patient's ability to understand information related to a proposed procedure and fully appreciate the consequences of their decision. This requirement ""reflects the belief that persons unable to make rational decisions about their medical care should be protected from making decisions that are harmful or that they would not make if they were able., 238
Voluntariness means that patients are able to exercise their right to make healthcare decisions free from manipulation and undue influence. 39 Manipulation can occur through distortion or omission of information in order to induce a specific choice by the patient . 4 Furthermore, the danger of undue influence is especially acute in light 241 of the power imbalance between doctor and patient. Presumed undue influence can be established by a showing that there was a relationship of trust and confidence between the victim and the defendant of such a nature that it is fair to presume the wrongdoer abused that relationship in order to compel the victim into the impugned transaction. Once a confidential relationship has been established, the burden shifts to the wrongdoer to show the victim entered into the transaction freely (possibly by showing the victim had independent advice). Certain relationships, as a matter of law, raise the presumption that undue influence has been exercised, such as those between lawyer and client or doctor and patient. 42 In the context of transplant tourism, it is easy to see that informed consent in many cases is either defective or wholly lacking. As discussed above, many donors in developing countries are assured by recruiters and medical personnel that the transplantation procedure will have little impact on their future health. 243 However, as a result of 244 the surgery, many are left unable to walk, run, or work. In some studies, more than eighty-five percent reported their health declined after the donation and almost eighty percent recommended against donating a kidney.245 At some point, many of the donors in poor countries are acquired through means of fraud, deception, and abuse of a position of power-all key ""means"" elements of the Trafficking Protocol.
The most prevalent ""means"" element utilized by traffickers is also the most opaque: the abuse of a position of vulnerability. While there are currently some experts attempting to clarify how this element is 246 being defined, an applied standard is far from being achieved. Often, ""vulnerable victim"" is narrowly defined as ""a victim who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to criminal conduct. 2 47 However, vulnerability has been expanded in some jurisdictions to include states of poverty and economic desperation. 248 ""Abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability"" was not defined in the Trafficking Protocol and the Travaux Priparatoires shows that the exact meaning was disputed during the drafting of the protocol. 249 However, the Travaux Priparatoires does include an interpretive note stating that the abuse of a position of vulnerability ""is understood as referring to any situation in which the person involved has no real or acceptable alternative but to submit to the abuse involved. 250 Other approaches have associated vulnerability to linguistic barriers, social isolation, physical disability, or a precarious financial, psychological 251 or social situation.
Looking at organ donors in impoverished countries, one has to be mindful of whether or not they may be able to truly make a fully autonomous decision to undergo the transplantation procedure, even if they technically understand the nature and consequences of the procedure. It has been stated that poverty is living ""without fundamental freedoms of action and choice, ''252 so consent given free from all forms of coercion may be impossible for many donors involved in transplant tourism. This is where the nexus between transplant tourism and trafficking for organ removal is most apparent. Instances where the donors are blatantly deceived and defrauded are obvious cases of human trafficking for organ procurement, but many of the procedures may simply be the product of the desperate poor doing what is necessary to free themselves of poverty's shackles. 53 Individuals engage in this type of risky behavior for money frequently and in many widely accepted professions. Therefore, the ethical lines of incentivized procurement should be left to the individual states to decide for themselves. As discussed, organ shortages are a major global problem and possible solutions have to be culturally conducive, or, as in the case of Brazil's presumed consent law, they will inevitably fail.
B. Pragmatic Enforcement
The most practical solution at the moment is to criminalize transplant tourism, especially in the wealthiest and most developed countries. Currently, trafficking for organ removal is driven by organ shortages in developed countries and weak enforcement in less developed countries. 54 The reality is that many of the transplant tourism destinations lack adequate laws and enforcement mechanisms to regulate the practice. 255 These countries, as ratifiers of the Trafficking Protocol, are equally obligated to accomplish meaningful anti-trafficking measures, but in the ocean of the various trafficking initiatives (forced labor, sex slavery, etc.), they simply do not have the resources or capacity to police strict organ procurement regimes. Since the key recipient countries of international organ procedures are largely Western or wealthy countries, the burden should initially fall on them to stem their citizens' engagement in transplant tourism. Most recipients of foreign transplantation procedures will require follow-up care with their domestic medical physician at some point, so there is a natural bottleneck in the process that would allow for easier law enforcement monitoring. That is why the clause mandating reporting of local medical staff to law enforcement is so critical to the viability of stemming trafficking cases. While some medical professionals may decry doctor-patient confidentiality, disclosure for suspected criminal behavior is already widely practiced in emergency rooms across the United States.256 Furthermore, the health risks posed to the general public by recipients returning from overseas justifies stiffer medical responsibility. 25 7
CONCLUSION
Human trafficking for organ removal is the product of decades of myopic organ procurement legislation and the resulting procurement shortages. In response, a large black market in organ procurement emerged and is supported by deception and desperation. The difficulty with this form of organized crime is that at some point in the process all of the parties involved, including the victims, have benefited from illicit activity and violated the law in one form or another. 258 Another difficulty is that sufficient enforcement of antitrafficking legislation will probably collide with medical regulations such as doctor-patient confidentiality and inaccessibility of medical records. 259 Even though there are obvious trafficking ""bottlenecks"" at capable medical facilities, which should intuitively make investigation easier, it is very difficult in practice to trace medical histories of recipients and data from the institutions performing the procedures.260
Criminalization of trafficking for organ removal must come first, but will not solve the problem alone because the root of the illicit trade is disparity in living standards. 26' There is no comprehensive effort to address the root cause of poverty and short-term strategies of public awareness are employed.262 There are limits to strictly ""law and order"" approaches to trafficking. Addressing poverty, unemployment, and other factors that increase an individual's vulnerability to trafficking requires creative and long-term approaches.263
The purpose of this Note is to propose a ""law and order"" approach that utilizes current international law, but remains flexible enough to allow for more organic, regional solutions to emerge. Countries, such as the United States, could take an active role in discouraging its citizens from engaging in transplant tourism by amending their national legislation to criminalize the practice and include both criminal and civil penalties; sanction other countries that permit and perform transplants for their citizens; and pursue new methods of organ procurement.264",10032.0,"<h4>Outright legalization dooms the effort because anti-trafficking rules prohibit certain consensual sales—the only solution is to crack down on those relationships and use alternative means of procurement</h4><p><strong>Ainley 2011</strong> – JD, University of Oregon School of Law (Robert, Oregon Review of International Law, “Organ Transploitation: A Model Law Approach to Combat Human Trafficking and Transplant Tourism”, 13 Or.

As discussed above, many donors in developing countries are assured by recruiters and medical personnel that the transplantation procedure will have little impact on their future health. 243 However, as a result of 244 the surgery, many are left unable to walk, run, or work. In some studies, <u><mark>more than eighty-five percent reported their health declined after </mark>the <mark>donation</u> </mark>and almost eighty percent recommended against donating a kidney.245 At some point, many of the donors in poor countries are acquired through means of fraud, deception, and abuse of a position of power-all key ""means"" elements of the Trafficking Protocol.</p><p><u>The most prevalent ""means"" element utilized by traffickers is</u> also the most opaque: the abuse of a position of <u>vulnerability</u>. While there are currently some experts attempting to clarify how this element is 246 being defined, an applied standard is far from being achieved. Often, ""vulnerable victim"" is narrowly defined as ""a victim who is unusually vulnerable due to age, physical or mental condition, or who is otherwise particularly susceptible to criminal conduct. 2 47 However, <u><mark>vulnerability has been expanded in some jurisdictions to include</u> </mark>states of poverty and <u><mark>economic desperation</u></mark>. 248 ""Abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability"" was not defined in the Trafficking Protocol and the Travaux Priparatoires shows that the exact meaning was disputed during the drafting of the protocol. 249 However, the Travaux Priparatoires does include an interpretive note stating that the abuse of a position of vulnerability ""is understood as referring to any situation in which the person involved has no real or acceptable alternative but to submit to the abuse involved. 250 <u>Other approaches have associated vulnerability to linguistic barriers, social isolation, physical disability, or a precarious financial, psychological</u> 251 <u>or social situation</u>.</p><p>Looking at organ donors in impoverished countries, one has to be mindful of whether or not they may be able to truly make a fully autonomous decision to undergo the transplantation procedure, even if they technically understand the nature and consequences of the procedure. <u>It has been stated that poverty is living ""without fundamental freedoms of action and choice</u>, ''252 <u><mark>so consent given free from </mark>all forms of <mark>coercion may be impossible for many donors </u></mark>involved in transplant tourism. <u>This is where the nexus between</u> transplant tourism and <u>trafficking</u> for organ removal <u>is most apparent</u>. Instances where the donors are blatantly deceived and defrauded are obvious cases of human trafficking for organ procurement, but many of the procedures may simply be the product of the desperate poor doing what is necessary to free themselves of poverty's shackles. 53 <u><strong><mark>Individuals engage in this type of risky behavior for money frequently</strong></mark> </u>and in many widely accepted professions. <u><mark>Therefore, the </mark>ethical <mark>lines of incentivized procurement should be left to the individual states</u> </mark>to decide for themselves. As discussed, organ shortages are a major global problem and <u>possible <mark>solutions have to be culturally conducive, or, as in the case of Brazil's presumed consent law, they will </mark>inevitably <mark>fail</u>.</p><p></mark>B. Pragmatic Enforcement</p><p>The most practical solution at the moment is to criminalize transplant tourism, especially in the wealthiest and most developed countries. <u><mark>Currently, trafficking </mark>for organ removal <mark>is driven by </mark>organ <mark>shortages in developed countries and weak enforcement in less developed countries</u></mark>. 54 <u>The reality is that many of the transplant tourism destinations lack adequate laws and enforcement mechanisms </u>to regulate the practice. 255 <u><mark>These countries, as ratifiers </mark>of the Trafficking Protocol, <mark>are </mark>equally <mark>obligated</u> </mark>to accomplish meaningful anti-trafficking measures, <u><mark>but</u> </mark>in the ocean of the various trafficking initiatives (forced labor, sex slavery, etc.), they <u><mark>simply do not have </mark>the <mark>resources</u> </mark>or capacity to police strict organ procurement regimes. <u><mark>Since the key recipient countries</u> </mark>of international organ procedures <u><mark>are</u></mark> largely <u><mark>Western or wealthy countries, the burden should</u> </mark>initially <u><mark>fall</mark> <mark>on them </mark>to stem their citizens' engagement</u> in transplant tourism. Most recipients of foreign transplantation procedures will require follow-up care with their domestic medical physician at some point, so there is a natural bottleneck in the process that would allow for easier law enforcement monitoring. That is why the clause mandating reporting of local medical staff to law enforcement is so critical to the viability of stemming trafficking cases. While some medical professionals may decry doctor-patient confidentiality, disclosure for suspected criminal behavior is already widely practiced in emergency rooms across the United States.256 Furthermore, the health risks posed to the general public by recipients returning from overseas justifies stiffer medical responsibility. 25 7</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p><u>Human trafficking for organ removal is the product of decades of myopic organ procurement legislation and the resulting</u> procurement <u>shortages</u>. In response, a large black market in organ procurement emerged and is supported by deception and desperation. <u><mark>The difficulty with this form of organized crime is that at some point in the process all of the parties </mark>involved, <mark>including the victims, have benefited</u> </mark>from illicit activity and violated the law in one form or another. 258 Another difficulty is that sufficient enforcement of antitrafficking legislation will probably collide with medical regulations such as doctor-patient confidentiality and inaccessibility of medical records. 259 Even though there are obvious trafficking ""bottlenecks"" at capable medical facilities, which should intuitively make investigation easier, it is very difficult in practice to trace medical histories of recipients and data from the institutions performing the procedures.260</p><p>Criminalization of trafficking for organ removal must come first, but will not solve the problem alone because the root of the illicit trade is disparity in living standards. 26' There is no comprehensive effort to address the root cause of poverty and short-term strategies of public awareness are employed.262 There are limits to strictly ""law and order"" approaches to trafficking. Addressing poverty, unemployment, and other factors that increase an individual's vulnerability to trafficking requires creative and long-term approaches.263</p><p>The purpose of this Note is to propose a ""law and order"" approach that utilizes current international law, but remains flexible enough to allow for more organic, regional solutions to emerge. Countries, such as <u><mark>the U</mark>nited <mark>S</mark>tates, <mark>could take an active role</mark> in discouraging</u> its citizens from engaging in <u>transplant tourism <mark>by amending</u></mark> their <u><mark>national legislation to criminalize the practice</u></mark> and include both criminal and civil penalties; <u>sanction other countries that permit</u> and perform transplants for their citizens; <u><mark>and pursue new methods of organ procurement</u></mark>.264</p>",semis neg v. northwestern mv,2nc,Solves Black Markets,445429,1,18369,./documents/ndtceda14/Michigan/PaAl/Michigan-Pappas-Allen-Neg-USC-Semis.docx,568589,N,USC,Semis,Northwestern MV,"David Cram-Helwich, Brian Box, Brett Bricker",,ndtceda14/Michigan/PaAl/Michigan-Pappas-Allen-Neg-USC-Semis.docx,,48712,PaAl,Michigan PaAl,,Al.....,Pa.....,El.....,Al.....,18792,Michigan,Michigan,,,1004,ndtceda14,NDT/CEDA 2014-15,2014,cx,college,2

The political calculations, ideology, and character flaws of both do indeed deserve much of the blame for America’s weakness and ineffectiveness abroad. Yet another factor is larger than any one individual, administration, or party––the flawed and often incoherent ideals shaping our understanding of interstate relations and our expectations of state behavior. Those ideals comprise a set of global norms that assume a universal morality shared by all countries despite the variety of cultures, religions, and governments in the world’s 196 nations. And those norms in turn are embodied in the international order that encompasses the various multinational institutions, tribunals, organizations, conventions, declarations on human rights, and treaties, the purposes of which is to regulate state behavior, deter or stop oppression and violence, promote peace and prosperity, and adjudicate conflict. Official remarks and commentary on the current crises have been informed by this notion of a global consensus about which state behaviors are legitimate and which are not. John Kerry’s comments on Russia’s conflict with Ukraine, for example, scolded Putin, “You just don’t in the 21st century behave in 19th century fashion by invading another country on a completely trumped up pretext.” Similarly, President Obama protested, “Russia’s leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident––that in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force, that international law matters, that people and nations can make their own decisions about their future,” for such aggression “is not how international law and international norms are observed in the 21st century.” Critics of the president’s handling of the crisis have endorsed this same international order they feel has been weakened by the U.S.’s timid or inept response. Fareed Zakaria of The Washington Post referred to “broader global norms––for example, against annexations by force. These have not always been honored, but, compared with the past, they have helped shape a more peaceful and prosperous world.” So too David Rivkin and Lee Casey in The Wall Street Journal evoked “the three basic principles of international law, reflected in the United Nations Charter and long-standing custom,” which “are the equality of all states, the sanctity of their territorial integrity, and noninterference of outsiders in their international affairs.” Rivkin and Casey allude to the two main sources of international law: treaties of the sort that created the United Nations, and “long-standing custom.” Both have their weaknesses and questionable assumptions. As Robert Bork writes in Coercing Virtue, “There is nothing that can be called law in any meaningful sense established by custom. If there were, it would not restrain international aggression; it is more likely to unleash it . . . if custom is what counts, it favors aggression.” This judgment is empirically validated by the incessant warfare, ethnic cleansing, civil wars, invasions of neighbors, and genocide that have attended the modern international order since its birth in the 19th century. As for treaties, a sovereign nation can refuse to sign a treaty. The United States, for example, has not signed the Ottawa Treaty banning anti-personnel mines. Nations can ignore or undermine treaties too, just as Russia violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum giving “security assurances” to Ukraine in exchange for the surrender of its nuclear arsenal. Or a nation can withdraw from a treaty if it no longer serves its interests. North Korea did this in 1994 when it withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency on its way to acquiring nuclear weapons. This behavior surprises no one who recognizes the wisdom expressed by George Washington, who said of the new nation’s alliance with France, “It is a maxim founded on the universal experience of mankind, that no nation can be trusted farther than it is bounded by its interests.” Internationalism, in contrast, assumes that “customary norms,” and the terms of a treaty like those creating international institutions, encode the universal morals and values that over time have emerged as the human race has progressed and become more civilized. Yet there is little evidence supporting this optimism, and much that shows Washington was right: national or regime interests determine whether these norms and terms, either customary or codified in treaties, are ignored, endorsed, or violated. We should not be surprised at this lack of consensus, given the variety of cultures, religions, and interests that shape both the means and the ends a state will pursue. For example, violence as an instrument for pursing national aims, including intentional violence against non-combatants, is proscribed by international law and agreements like the Geneva and Hague conventions. Yet different peoples can have different conceptions of when such violence is legitimate. In many Middle Eastern countries, for example, guerilla attacks against non-combatants far from any battlefield are called terrorism by Westerners, yet dubbed legitimate “resistance” by those like the Palestinian Arabs, who name parks and streets after notorious terrorists, celebrate their deeds in school curricula, and subsidize them and their families with stipends. This disagreement about the legitimacy of violence and its acceptable victims reflects radically different beliefs that cannot be harmonized in some larger set of global “norms.” The primacy of national interest likewise explains the failure of states to consistently intervene in order to punish those violators of international “norms” such as “noninterference of outsiders” in another nation’s affairs, or respect for “territorial integrity.” China’s absorption of Tibet, or Turkey’s annexation of northern Cyprus, was met with diplomatic censure but left unpunished. Today these ongoing occupations––like Putin’s earlier violation of Georgia’s territorial integrity–– are faits accomplis, rarely mentioned even as Russia’s similar annexation of Crimea is condemned. So too with violations of the universal prohibition against genocide, perhaps the most grievous crime in international law. Over 400,000 people in Darfur have been killed by Arab militias at the instigation of the Sudanese government, and 800,000 were slaughtered in Rwanda. These  crimes and violations of international law were not stopped or punished because it was not in the national interests of any major power to expend the necessary money and lives of its citizens, or to risk the unforeseen geopolitical consequences and blowback of such an intervention, to do so. These political calculations of national interests,  more often than not conflict with those of other nations, when camouflaged by public protestations of fealty to international norms and law, has opened up Western nations to the charge of hypocrisy and cynicism, and consequently eroded their moral authority. Given that “international law is not law but politics,” Bork writes, “it is dangerous to give the name ‘law,’ which summons up respect, to political struggles that are essentially lawless.” A further incoherence bedevils the idea of international norms binding on all peoples. The cultural relativism dominant in the West proscribes making negative judgments about the cultures and practices of other nations. Such criticisms are thought to bespeak a lingering imperialist and colonialist, if not racist, arrogance—an attempt to impose Western morality and values on peoples with their own distinct and cherished cultures. Yet the foundational ideals of internationalism, such as human rights that exist apart from any particular regime or culture, imply not just a universalism contradicting cultural relativism, but also a moral ranking of cultures determined by their adherence to human rights, sex equality, tolerance for religious minorities, honesty in negotiation, individual freedom, and the stigmatizing of brutality and violence. Yet how can these privileged norms be coherently integrated with the idea of national sovereignty and self-determination, and the imperative to respect and tolerate the cultural differences that define a unique national identity? If we are unwilling to say that ideals like respecting the territorial integrity of neighbors are superior to, not just different from, the cultures of other nations that violate such ideals; and if we cannot affirm that they trump the “sanctity” of the offenders’ territorial integrity and so justify our interventions to stop or punish violators––even if the aggressor’s behavior is motivated by beliefs and values integral to that nation’s culture and identity––then the foundations of the international order are built on sand, and our foreign policy will appear to be yet another hypocritical perfuming of realpolitik with idealistic rhetoric, or the empty diplomatic gestures of a weak state eager to avoid conflict. In all the current crises, these contradictions and inconsistencies have compromised our responses and limited our actions, with the result that our interests and security have been endangered by the perception of weakness such failures invite. We need to recognize that the belief in norms established by custom or by treaty will not truly exist until nations share, as Bork writes, “a common political morality or are under a common sovereignty. A glance at the real world suggests we have a while to wait.” And as we wait for that utopian day unlikely to ever arrive, we should not be surprised that global predators continue to scorn “customary norms” and violate treaties, governed only by the timeless Thucydidean maxim–– “The strong do what they can, and the weak suffer what they must.”","norms multinational organizations, conventions and treaties have not been honored no nation can be trusted farther than its interests a treaty encode universal morals there is little evidence supporting this optimism national interests determine whether these terms customary or codified in treaties are endorsed We should not be surprised at lack of consensus, given variety of cultures, religions, and interests violations were not stopped or punished because major power interests conflict with other nations the foundations of international order are built on sand our foreign policy will be empty diplomatic gestures of a weak state our security have been endangered by the perception of weakness as we wait for utopia unlikely to arrive, we should not be surprised global predators continue to violate treaties","The responsibility for these setbacks is often laid at the feet of President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry.

If we are unwilling to say that ideals like respecting the territorial integrity of neighbors are superior to, not just different from, the cultures of other nations that violate such ideals; and if we cannot affirm that they trump the “sanctity” of the offenders’ territorial integrity and so justify our interventions to stop or punish violators––even if the aggressor’s behavior is motivated by beliefs and values integral to that nation’s culture and identity––then <mark>the foundations of</mark> the <mark>international order are built on sand</mark>, and <mark>our foreign policy will</mark> appear to <mark>be</mark> yet another hypocritical perfuming of realpolitik with idealistic rhetoric, or the <mark>empty diplomatic gestures of a weak state</mark> eager to avoid conflict. In all the current crises, these contradictions and inconsistencies have compromised our responses and limited our actions, with the result that <mark>our</mark> interests and <mark>security have been endangered by the perception of weakness</mark> such failures invite.

United States and Printz, there were questions about the extent to which the so-called ""anti-commandeering principle"" operated. The Court thought otherwise. In a unanimous opinion, it drew a distinction between mandates from the federal government that required affirmative action on the part of states and their officials and preemption, which, it noted, not only required mere forbearance on the state's part but was [*930] also rooted in the text of the Supremacy Clause itself. n72 Since the Act in question was a valid exercise of Congress's commerce power, the Court held it was binding on the states. Soon after Lopez was decided, the Court decided United States v. Robertson, which raised the question whether a local Alaska gold mine's operations ""substantially affected"" interstate commerce for purposes of the RICO statute.

VI. TAKE FIVE: IS RAICH THE ""THIRD DEATH OF FEDERALISM?"" n55 OR WAS LOPEZ MERELY ""ZOMBIE FEDERALISM""? Early on, Lopez appeared to signify that reinvigoration of a judicially-enforced federalism was the principal project of what Professor Merrill has coined the ""second Rehnquist Court."" n56 Chief Justice Rehnquist appeared to make good on his prior expression of confidence that federalism ""will ... in time again command the support of a majority of this Court."" n57 The evidence was certainly there: requiring Congress to make a ""clear statement"" was designed to protect federalism interests, n58 as was articulation of the ""anti-commandeering"" principle. These were followed not only by Lopez, but also by the expansion of sovereign immunity beginning with Seminole Tribe v. Florida, n59 by the limitation of congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, n60 by extension of the anti-commandeering principle in Printz v. United States, n61 and, finally, by invoking the Commerce Clause for the second time in five years to invalidate an Act of Congress. n62 The combined effect of these cases led one federal judge to complain that the Court was ""narrowing the nation's power""; and that the Court had ""sided with the states"" against federal power. n63 [*928] The near-hysteria expressed by some academics at the Court's tentative steps toward judicial enforcement of federalism principles obscured a good deal that should have given comfort to those who heard, in the opinions of the Federalism Five, the hoofbeats of the New Deal's famously obstructionist ""Four Horsemen."" First, there were a number of cases decided contemporaneously with those whose holdings were in tension with the federalism cases, and the Court never seemed (as Raich graphically demonstrates) to be able to follow earlier cases to their logical conclusions. Second, when examined closely, many of the ""restraints"" imposed on Congress by the Court's federalism decisions proved to be rather mild fetters that could easily be circumvented. In this Part we attempt a retrospective (if panoramic) view of these dissonant notes in the Rehnquist Court's federalism project. Future historians might consider whether there was, at last, anything for the Raich Court to kill off - if, in fact, Raich represents any retreat at all. A. The Spending Power Many hoped that the Court would follow up Lopez by elaborating the limits on Congress's power to impose conditional restrictions on money appropriated to states, thus enabling it to regulate indirectly what it could not regulate directly. n64 In Sabri v. United States, n65 however, the Court declined the opportunity, upholding Congress's power to criminalize bribery of a state official concerning a state program that received some federal money, despite the lack of any connection between the federal money and the bribe itself. n66 While there were some procedural issues that made the issues in Sabri less clean than they might have been, nothing in the case indicated any appetite to strengthen Dole's rather flaccid constraints on conditional spending requirements, much less revisit larger constitutional questions such as whether Congress can spend ""for the general welfare"" or only in connection with one of its Article I, Section 8 enumerated powers. B. Preemption Court critics made great sport of contrasting several of the Court's recent cases in which state power was deemed to have been preempted by federal law with cases like Morrison or Seminole Tribe. Indeed, the Court - including members of the Federalism Five - has shown a real appetite for applying implied preemption doctrines liberally, even to the point of limiting or [*929] extinguishing state common law tort claims, n67 despite the Court's previous admonition that preemption of statutes reflecting an exercise of a state's traditional police powers required a clear statement of congressional intent to do so. n68 The erosion of the ""presumption against preemption"" has been particularly noticeable in cases involving state regulations that have international implications. Recently, in fact, the Court held that a mere presidential policy statement that Holocaust survivors and their heirs should settle claims outside of the judicial system and through a system established by executive agreement was sufficient to preempt a state law requiring merely that insurance companies disclose their involvement in insurance sales prior to the Holocaust as a condition of doing business in the state. n69 This despite the fact that the executive agreement establishing the compensation fund disclaimed any preemptive intent and the fact that Congress had both acknowledged that states were legislating in this area and had, years before, left the regulation of the insurance industry to the states. C. The Anti-Commandeering Principle In the wake of New York v. United States and Printz, there were questions about the extent to which the so-called ""anti-commandeering principle"" operated. After all, preemption itself, as Mark Tushnet has argued, constitutes a type of commandeering, since it ""commands"" the states and their officials not to engage in particular types of conduct, and may require the expenditure of resources to comply with the federal regime. n70 South Carolina might therefore have been forgiven for thinking that it had a winner when it challenged a federal statute prohibiting any person or state from selling driver's license data. n71 The Court thought otherwise. In a unanimous opinion, it drew a distinction between mandates from the federal government that required affirmative action on the part of states and their officials and preemption, which, it noted, not only required mere forbearance on the state's part but was [*930] also rooted in the text of the Supremacy Clause itself. n72 Since the Act in question was a valid exercise of Congress's commerce power, the Court held it was binding on the states. D. The Commerce Power Soon after Lopez was decided, the Court decided United States v. Robertson, which raised the question whether a local Alaska gold mine's operations ""substantially affected"" interstate commerce for purposes of the RICO statute. n73 In a per curiam opinion, the Court concluded that because the mine purchased out-of-state equipment and supplies, it was engaged in interstate commerce for purposes of that statute, and did not reach the substantial effects question. n74 For some commentators Robertson signaled that Lopez was likely a limited decision. n75 Had Lopez been a truly transformative opinion, one might have expected the Court to hear more Commerce Clause cases, much as it did when expanding the scope of sovereign immunity. The Court did not lack for attractive candidates, but it either refused to grant certiorari, n76 dodged the constitutional question, n77 or affirmed the power of [*931] Congress. n78 With the benefit of hindsight, it is Lopez and Morrison, not Raich, that look like the outliers. n79 E. The Scope of Congressional Power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment Another of Rehnquist Court critics' bete noires n80 was the limitation imposed by the Court on congressional power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. Announced unanimously in Boerne v. Flores, that Court's ""proportionality and congruence"" test combined with the Court's robust sovereign immunity jurisprudence to curb congressional efforts to subject states to liability for damages under federal civil rights statutes. n81 In 2003, however, the Court pulled back, voting 6-3 to uphold provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act. n82 Professor Suzanna Sherry has persuasively argued that Hibbs is not consistent with what the Court's prior cases in this area hold, and that the Court ""unmade"" precedent in order to reach the result it desired. n83 * * * [*932] When one focuses on the sweep of the Court's cases (especially within the last five years), as opposed to focusing on particular decisions, Judge Noonan's claim that the Court had ""sided with the states"" seems melodramatic. In fact, it seems as if the Court's moves towards federalism were merely dissonant notes in an overwhelmingly nationalist melody. n84 That was the thesis of Robert Nagel's The Implosion of American Federalism, a book that, when it was written, was decidedly heterodox. n85 Nagel argued that whatever moves the Court was making in the name of ""federalism"" or ""state's rights"" were overshadowed - particularly in its decisions under the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment - by a consistent and relentless nationalization that began sixty years ago and continued largely unabated, even during the high tide of the Rehnquist Court's federalism project. He concluded that even ostensibly ""state's rights"" or ""federalist"" justices actually offered a relatively tepid federalism, that ""radical federalism"" was unlikely, and that the Court's program of ""radical nationalism,"" particularly in civil liberties areas was likely to continue unabated. What seemed to be a somewhat peevish dissent from the conventional wisdom at the time, after Raich, looks prescient. Looking at the case law as a whole, we wonder whether there was enough life left in judicially-enforceable federalism for Raich to kill. In retrospect, it seems the Rehnquist Court conjured a zombie federalism that wandered aimlessly for a while, killing off the occasional federal statute drafted with no thought as to constitutionality (akin to the usual horror movie zombie victims who wander away from the group), but which, in the end, was pretty easy to kill without even the aid of a shotgun-wielding action hero.",10034.0,"<h4>Raich didn’t kill federalism—it was already dead</h4><p>Lopez was the exception that proved the rule—the court has no appetite for enforcing dual federalism—their precedent will be circumvented anyway</p><p><u><strong><mark>Reynolds</mark> and Denning <mark>05</mark> (Glenn, Beauchamp Brogan Distinguished Professor of Law, The University of Tennessee, and Brannon, Associate Professor of Law and Director of Faculty Development, Cumberland School of Law at Samford University, Winter 2005, ""FEDERALISM AFTER GONZALES V.

On Saturday, a large demonstration in Mexico City turned violent, with some protesters lighting cars on fire and attempting to burn down the presidential palace. On Monday, another demonstration shut down the Acapulco airport. On Tuesday, protesters set fire to the ruling party's regional headquarters in Guerrero state.¶ This began as a movement to demand justice and answers in the case of 43 students who were kidnapped and likely killed by a drug cartel at the behest of corrupt politicians, but has turned into something much larger, touching on some of the biggest and most daunting issues facing Mexico today. Here's what you need to know about the protests in Mexico and the deeper forces driving the unrest.¶ 1) What are the protests about?¶ Protests Mexico City¶ Protesters in Mexico City on November 8 ( Miguel Tovar/LatinContent/Getty Images)¶ The protests started in response to a horrible attack on a group of student protesters in Iguala, a small city in Mexico's Guerrero province. However, they've now become much broader — a way for Mexicans to protest against the violence and corruption that plague their country.¶ The 43 student protesters disappeared outside Iguala on September 26, and are believed to have been murdered by a drug cartel at the behest of corrupt local officials. Shortly after the attack, the body of one of the students was found with his eyes gouged out and the skin from his face removed. His companions remain missing.¶ Last week, police announced that two ""gang members"" had confessed to murdering the students and burning their bodies in a garbage dump outside of the city before stuffing the charred remains into trash bags and throwing them in a river.¶ Some burned remains have been recovered from the dump and river, but they have not yet been conclusively identified as belonging to the missing students — the Mexican government has said that it lacks the technology necessary to do DNA analysis on the fragments, which were badly burned. They have asked a lab in Austria to assist with that process.¶ 2) Why did the kidnapping become such a big deal?¶ Riot police Mexico¶ Protesters face off with riot police on November 10 during the demonstrations at the Acapulco airport (Pedro Pardo/AFP/Getty Images)¶ Drug cartel violence is nothing new to Mexico. But the students' kidnapping struck a nerve and quickly became a national story, prompting protests around the country that have grown for more than a month. That's not just because the kidnapping was so terrible — although it was — but because the attack encapsulated many Mexicans' worst fears and frustrations about where their country is headed.¶ There's the fear that public corruption is out of control: the mayor of Iguala and his wife apparently had close ties to Guerros Unidos, a local drug cartel, and ordered the police to hand the students over to the gang, which murdered them. There's the fear that corruption and violence will be used to suppress political dissent: the town's mayor appears to have ordered the students to be arrested so that their protests wouldn't disrupt a speech by his wife. There's the fear that even ordinary Mexicans, who have no ties to the drug trade or politics, still can't escape from politicized violence: the students were ordinary kids from poor families, studying to be teachers.¶ And finally, but crucially, the students' disappearance has also become the manifestation of Mexicans' fear that their government doesn't take those problems seriously, or even treats calls to fix them with disdain. On November 7, Mexico's Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam cut off a press conference about the students with a muttered ""ya me cansé "" — a phrase that basically means ""I'm tired of this already.""¶ To many Mexicans, it seemed like Murillo was dismissing the missing students as an annoyance, or a waste of time. They reacted with fury. The hashtag #YaMeCansé began trending on Twitter, as Mexicans began tweeting and uploading videos about what they were tired of: corruption, crime, violence — as well as Murillo himself and Mexico's president, Enrique Peña Nieto.¶ The next day there was a large protest in Mexico City, with demonstrators carrying hand-made Ya Me Cansé banners and signs. That evening, the demonstration turned violent, as protestors lit cars on fire and attempted to burn down the presidential palace.¶ 3) Are things in Mexico really that bad?¶ Mexico City Protests¶ Protests in Mexico City on November 8 (Miguel Tovar/LatinContent/Getty Images)¶ Yes. Violence in Mexico is out of control, and organized crime has spread throughout the country like a cancer, destroying any legitimate institutions that get in its way.¶ The International Crisis Group estimates that a staggering 47,000 to 70,000 people were killed in drug war-related violence between 2006 and 2012 alone, along with thousands more who disappeared and whose fate remains unknown. Human Rights Watch puts that number at 60,000.¶ The police, military, and other state security forces were responsible for many of those killings and disappearances, as well as for torture and other human rights abuses. Amnesty International documented a 600 percent rise in torture committed by state security officials between 2003 and 2013.¶ Violence has often been used to terrorize or eliminate Mexicans who support the rule of law. Hundreds of human rights defenders, journalists, judges, police officers, and politicians have been murdered. Government corruption has deepened criminal groups' leverage, buying off those who haven't been scared away.¶ That has had the effect of silencing dissent as well as weakening law enforcement and democratic institutions, not to mention destroying public trust, all of which makes the drug war problems even worse.¶ Mexico's judicial system has, for all practical purposes, collapsed. 80 percent of homicides remain unsolved and in some states fewer than one in 20 murders results in a conviction. The violence has become so extreme, and the impunity so absolute, that a coalition of Mexican human rights groups recently asked the International Criminal Court to open an investigation into Mexican crimes against humanity.¶ 4) How did Mexico become such a disaster?¶ Guerrero state protesters¶ Demonstrators clash with riot police during protests in Chilpancingo, a city in Mexico's Guerrero state (Eduardo Guerrero/AFP/Getty Images)¶ There are a lot of factors, but the crisis has its roots in Mexico's transition, in the 1990s and early 2000s, from a de-facto single-party dictatorship to a multi-party democracy. That transition opened up a power vacuum — and organized crime rushed to fill it.¶ Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, held power for 71 years in what the writer Mario Vargas Llosa has called the ""dictadura perfecta"" — the perfect dictatorship. Its rule was marked by corruption and authoritarianism, but the stability of the one-party state limited criminal competition, which acted as a check on violence.¶ However, the PRI lost its absolute majority in Mexico's Congress in 1997, and then the presidency in 2000.¶ The democratic transition brought many benefits to Mexico. But dismantling the one-party state weakened Mexican institutions, and created a competition for power and influence that wasn't limited to lawful methods, or legitimate goals.¶ From the top to the bottom, the PRI government had ruled Mexico through a system of corruption, patronage, and authoritarian enforcement. That system was corrupt and unjust, but it was stable. When the party left power and that system splintered, it opened up a power vacuum at every level of Mexican society. That created an opportunity for criminal groups, who used corruption and violence to expand their operations and co-opt political power. The cartels became much more powerful, and daily life in Mexico became much more violent.¶ This got much worse after September 11, 2001. As part of its global war on terror, the US clamped down on its border with Mexico. That disrupted established smuggling routes, setting off renewed — and necessarily fiercer — competition between different cartels for border territory and smuggling routes.¶ The results were disastrous. Because the always-challenging process of Mexico's democratic transition had left its law enforcement institutions and politicians weaker, they lacked the power to constrain the cartels, whose competition for the most lucrative ""plazas"" — smuggling territories — was fierce.¶ As new cartels grew and old ones sought to expand or consolidate their holdings, violence escalated — much of it intended to grab attention and inspire fear through exceptional brutality. La Familia Michoacana, a relatively new cartel, announced its arrival on the scene in 2006 by emptying a sackful of severed heads onto the floor of a nightclub.¶ When the Mexican military killed the head of the Beltran Leyva cartel, members of his organization attacked the funeral of a marine killed in the operation, murdering his mother, aunt, and siblings in revenge. The Tijuana cartel murdered so many people that it had to employ someone (known colloquially as ""the Stewmaker"") full-time to dispose of the bodies by dissolving them in acid.¶ 5) So is Mexico a failed state?¶ Mexico never became a completely failed state — but it has failed in a number of important respects.¶ Many of Mexico's institutions have been weakened or co-opted by organized crime. That process takes many forms, from bribing sympathetic officials, to killing or frightening off people who might oppose them, to installing cartel-friendly faces in key roles.¶ The result has been to diminish the state's capacity to act independently or control criminal organizations. And that sets off a vicious cycle, as state weakness gives criminal groups more room to thrive, and thus more ability to weaken state institutions even further.",10043.0,"<h4><u>corruption</u>, <u>protests</u>, <u>judicial system</u>, <u>violence</u> create a <u>vicious cycle</u> that <u>collapses the state</h4><p></u>Updated by Amanda <u><strong>Taub 11-12 on November 12, 2014, 3:50 p.m. ET “It’s about much more than missing students: Mexico’s massive protest movement, explained” http://www.vox.com/2014/11/12/7194603/mexico-protests-iguala-massacre</p><p>Mexico has been roiled</u></strong> by near-constant protests in recent weeks, and <u><strong>all signs are that the demonstrations are continuing to gather steam. </u></strong>On Saturday, a large demonstration in Mexico City turned violent, with some <u><strong>protesters light</u></strong>ing<u><strong> cars on fire and attempting to burn down the presidential palace</u></strong>.

However, they've now become much broader — a way for Mexicans to protest against the violence and corruption that plague their country.¶ The 43 student protesters disappeared outside Iguala on September 26, and are believed to have been murdered by a drug cartel at the behest of corrupt local officials. Shortly after the attack, the body of one of the students was found with his eyes gouged out and the skin from his face removed.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides.
Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements. Eventually they too will be swept up in the multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized elements into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive network.",10047.0,"<h4>Voting Aff affirms the transformational power of oppositional networks to resist capital itself & accelerate the fragmenting power of anti-hegemonic networks – larger trajectory of reform can be understood as a strategy for political action</h4><p><strong>Hardt 2</strong> – Prof. of Literature @ Duke & The European Graduate School</p><p>New Left Review, New Left Review 14, March-April 2002, </p><p>http://newleftreview.org/II/14/michael-hardt-porto-alegre-today-s-bandung</p><p>Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough.

This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. <u><strong>The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization.</u></strong> The <u><strong>traditional parties</u></strong> and centralized campaigns <u><strong>generally occupy the national sovereignty pole</u></strong>, whereas the <u><strong>new movements organized in horizontal networks</u></strong> tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, <u><strong>neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis </u></strong>that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. <u><strong>They</u></strong> rather <u><strong>present different political strategies for action</u></strong> today <u><strong>which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. </u></strong>Parties vs networks In a previous period <u><strong>we could</u></strong> have <u><strong>stage</u></strong>d <u><strong>an old</u></strong>-style ideological <u><strong>confrontation between the two positions</u></strong>. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. <u><strong>Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state</u></strong>. <u><strong>And</u></strong> the second <u><strong>could reply that national regimes</u></strong> and other forms of sovereignty, <u><strong>corrupt</u></strong> and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, <u><strong>but <mark>no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network</u></strong></mark>? <u><strong><mark>The movements organized within them do exert</u></strong></mark> their <u><strong><mark>power</u></strong></mark>, <u><strong><mark>but they do not proceed through oppositions</u></strong></mark>. <u><strong><mark>One</u></strong></mark> of the <u><strong><mark>basic</mark> <mark>characteristic</mark>s</u></strong> <u><strong><mark>of</mark> <mark>the network form</u></strong></mark> is that <u><strong><mark>no two nodes face each other in contradiction</u></strong></mark>; rather, <u><strong><mark>they are always triangulated by a third</u></strong></mark>, and then a fourth, <u><strong><mark>and </u></strong></mark>then<u><strong><mark> by an indefinite number of others in the web</u></strong></mark>. <u><strong><mark>This is</u></strong></mark> one of the <u><strong><mark>characteristic</u></strong></mark>s <u><strong><mark>of </u></strong></mark>the Seattle<u><strong><mark> events that we have had the most trouble understanding</u></strong></mark>: <u><strong><mark>groups which we thought in objective contradiction</mark> <mark>to one another</u></strong></mark>—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—<u><strong><mark>were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network</u></strong></mark> of the multitude.

I find a renewed commitment to the evaluative norms of scholarship clearly agreed-upon protocols of fair scholarship benefit from explicit affirmation","Lets first examine the claim that my book is ""unwittingly"" inviting a resurrection of the ""Enlightenment-equals-totalitarianism position."" How, one wonders, could a book promoting argument and debate, and promoting reason-giving practices as a kind of common ground that should prevail over assertions of cultural authenticity, somehow come to be seen as a dangerous resurgence of bad Enlightenment? Robbins tells us why: I want ""argument on my own terms""-that is, I want to impose reason on people, which is a form of power and oppression. But what can this possibly mean? Arguments stand or fall based on whether they are successful and persuasive, even an argument in favor of argument. It simply is not the case that an argument in favor of the importance of reasoned debate to liberal democracy is tantamount to oppressive power. To assume so is to assume, in the manner of Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer, that reason is itself violent, inherently, and that it will always mask power and enforce exclusions. But to assume this is to assume the very view of Enlightenment reason that Robbins claims we are ""thankfully"" well rid of. (I leave to the side the idea that any individual can proclaim that a debate is over, thankfully or not.) But perhaps Robbins will say, ""I am not imagining that your argument is directly oppressive, but that what you argue for would be, if it were enforced."" Yet my book doesn't imagine or suggest it is enforceable; I simply argue in favor of, I promote, an ethos of argument within a liberal democratic and proceduralist framework. As much as Robbins would like to think so, neither I nor the books I write can be cast as an arm of the police.
Robbins wants to imagine a far more direct line of influence from criticism to political reality, however, and this is why it can be such a bad thing to suggest norms of argument. Watch as the gloves come off:
Faced with the prospect of submitting to her version of argument roughly, Habermass version-and of being thus authorized to disagree only about other, smaller things, some may feel that there will have been an end to argument, or an end to the arguments they find most interesting. With current events in mind, I would be surprised if there were no recourse to the metaphor of a regular army facing a guerilla insurrection, hinting that Anderson wants to force her opponents to dress in uniform, reside in well-demarcated camps and capitals that can be bombed, fight by the rules of states (whether the states themselves abide by these rules or not), and so on-in short, that she wants to get the battle onto a terrain where her side will be assured of having the upper hand.
Lets leave to the side the fact that this is a disowned hypothetical criticism. (As in, ""Well, okay, yes, those are my gloves, but those are somebody elses hands they will have come off of."") Because far more interesting, actually, is the sudden elevation of stakes. It is a symptom of the sorry state of affairs in our profession that it plays out repeatedly this tragicomic tendency to give a grandiose political meaning to every object it analyzes or confronts. We have evidence of how desperate the situation is when we see it in a critic as thoughtful as Bruce Robbins, where it emerges as the need to allegorize a point about an argument in such a way that it gets cast as the equivalent of war atrocities. It is especially ironic in light of the fact that to the extent that I do give examples of the importance of liberal democratic proceduralism, I invoke the disregard of the protocols of international adjudication in the days leading up to the invasion of Iraq; I also speak about concerns with voting transparency. It is hard for me to see how my argument about proceduralism can be associated with the policies of the Bush administration when that administration has exhibited a flagrant disregard of democratic procedure and the rule of law. I happen to think that a renewed focus on proceduralism is a timely venture, which is why I spend so much time discussing it in my final chapter. But I hasten to add that I am not interested in imagining that proceduralism is the sole political response to the needs of cultural criticism in our time: my goal in the book is to argue for a liberal democratic culture of argument, and to suggest ways in which argument is not served by trumping appeals to identity and charismatic authority. I fully admit that my examples are less political events than academic debates; for those uninterested in the shape of intellectual arguments, and eager for more direct and sustained discussion of contemporary politics, the approach will disappoint. Moreover, there will always be a tendency for a proceduralist to under-specify substance, and that is partly a principled decision, since the point is that agreements, compromises, and policies get worked out through the communicative and political process. My book is mainly concentrated on evaluating forms of arguments and appeals to ethos, both those that count as a form of trump card or distortion, and those that flesh out an understanding of argument as a universalist practice. There is an intermittent appeal to larger concerns in the political democratic culture, and that is because I see connections between the ideal of argument and the ideal of deliberative democracy. But there is clearly, and indeed necessarily, significant room for further elaboration here.
There is a way to make Robbins’s point more narrowly which would run something like this: Anderson has a very restricted notion of how argument should play out, or appear, within academic culture, given the heavy emphasis on logical consistency and normative coherence and explicitness. This conception of argument is too narrow (and hence authoritarian). To this I would reply simply that logical consistency and normative coherence and explicitness do not exhaust the possible forms, modes, and strategies of argumentation. There is a distinction to be made between the identification of moves that stultify or disarm argument, and an insistence on some sort of single manner of reasoned argument. The former I am entirely committed to; the latter not at all, despite the fact that I obviously favor a certain style of argument, and even despite the fact that I am philosophically committed to the claims of the theory of communicative reason. I do address the issue of diverse forms and modes of argument in the first and last chapters of the book (as I discuss above), but it seems that a more direct reflection on the books own mode of argumentation might have provided the occasion for a fuller treatment of the issues that trouble Robbins.
Different genres within academe have different conventions, of course, and we can and do make decisions all the time about what rises to the level of cogency within specific   venues, and what doesn't. Some of those judgments have to do with protocols of argument. The book review, for example, is judged according to whether the reviewer responsibly represents the scholarship under discussion, seems to have a good grasp of the body of scholarship it belongs to, and convincingly and fairly points out strengths and weaknesses. The book forum is a bit looser-one expects responsible representation of the scholarship under discussion, but it can be more selectively focused on a key set of issues. And one expects a bit of provocation, in order to make the exchange readable and dramatic. But of course in a forum exchange there is an implicit norm of argument, a tendency to judge whether a particular participant is making a strong or a weak case in light of the competing claims at play. Much of our time in the profession is taken with judging the quality of all manner of academic performance, and much of it has to do with norms of argument, however much Robbins may worry about their potentially coercive nature.
From time to time I myself have wondered whether my book is too influenced by the modes of academe. But when I read a piece of writing like the one that Elspeth Probyn produced, I find myself feeling a renewed commitment to the evaluative norms of responsible scholarship, and to the idea that clearly agreed-upon genres and protocols of fair scholarship benefit from explicit affirmation at times. Probyn's piece does not conform at all to the conventions of the forum response. She may herself be quite delighted that it does not. Robbins may find himself delighted that she represents a viewpoint that does not agree on my (totalitarian) fundamentals of forum responses. But I would simply say that here we do not have fair or reasoned argument, which is one of the enabling procedures of forum exchanges. Indeed, I hear a different genre altogether: the venting phone call to a friend or intimate. In this genre, which I think we are all familiar with, one is not expected or required to give reasons or evidence, as one is in academic argument. Here's how the phone call might go: ""Ugh. I have to write a response to this awful book. I agreed to this because I thought the book had an interesting title; it's called The Way We Argue Now. But I can't get through it; it isn't at all what I expected. I find myself alternately bored and irritated. It's so from the center—totally American parochial, and I just hate the style: polemical in a slam-bam-thank-you-ma'am way—really quite mean-spirited. She's so arrogant. And you wouldn't believe the so-called critique of Foucault. I don't know, I think I'm just sick of abstract theory—I mean, aren't we past this? It's so stultifying. I wish there were some way to get out of the commitment. I don't know how I'm ever going to get to it anyway, with all my journalism deadlines."" The friend: ""That sounds awful. But just use the occasion to write about something else, something you think is important. Write about yourself. Direct attention to a book that you do like. Whatever you do, don't spend too much time on it. And definitely call her out on the American centrism.""",10041.0,"<h4>All arguments are framework arguments---exclusion args rely on a false dichotomy because debate <u>requires</u> continual judgment about which arguments are persuasive and which can be dismissed even though this usually happens implicitly---we don’t have the power to impose a norm, only to persuade you that their argumentative practices should be rejected</h4><p>Amanda <strong>Anderson 6</strong>, Andrew W.

Latinos, Asian Americans—the answer seems to be that us includes everyone except white men.¶ This result is not illogical. When Malcolm X condemned ""the white man"" and declared him the enemy, he was not, of course, speaking about any par- ticular white man, but rather the white, patriarchal order that characterized both slavery and Jim Crow. Malcolm X understood that the United States was created by and for privileged white men. It was white men who dominated politics, controlled the nation's wealth, and wrote the rules by which everyone else was forced to live. No group in the United States can be said to have experienced more privilege, and gone to greater lengths to protect it, than ""the white man.""¶ Yet the white man, it turns out, has suffered too. The fact that his suffering has been far less extreme, and has not been linked to a belief in his inherent inferiority, has not made his suffering less real. Civil rights advocates, however, have treated the white man's suffering as largely irrelevant to the pursuit of the promised land. As civil rights lawyers unveiled plans to desegregate public schools, it was poor and working-class whites who were expected to bear the burden of this profound social adjustment, even though many of them were as desperate for upward social mobility and quality education as African Americans. According to the 1950 census, among Southerners in their late twenties, the state-by-state percentages of functional illiterates (people with less than five years of schooling) for whites on farms overlapped with those for blacks in the cities. The majority of Southern whites were better off than Southern blacks, but they were not affluent or well educated by any means; they were semiliterate (with less than twelve years of schooling). Only a tiny minority of whites were affluent and well educated. They stood far apart from the rest of the whites and virtually all blacks.59¶ What lower-class whites did have was what W.E.B. Du Bois described as “the public and psychological wage” paid to white workers, who depended on their status and privileges as whites to compensate for low pay and harsh working conditions.60 As described in chapter 1, time and time again, poor and working-class whites were persuaded to choose their racial status interests over their common economic interests with blacks, resulting in the emergence of new caste systems that only marginally benefited whites but were devastating for African Americans. ¶ In retrospect, it seems clear that nothing could have been more important in the 1970s and 1980s than finding a way to create a durable, interracial, bottom-up coalition for social and economic justice to ensure that another caste system did not emerge from the ashes of Jim Crow. Priority should have been given to figuring out some way for poor and working-class whites to feel as though they had a stake—some tangible interest—in the nascent integrated racial order. As Lani Guinier points out, however, the racial liberalism expressed in the Brown v. Board of Education decision and endorsed by civil rights litigators “did not offer poor whites even an elementary framework for understanding what they might gain as a result of integration.”61¶ Nothing in the opinion or in the subsequent legal strategy made clear that segregation had afforded elites a crucial means of exercising social control over poor and working-class whites as well as blacks. The Southern white elite, whether planters or industrialists, had successfully endeavored to make all whites think in racial rather than class terms, predictably leading whites to experience desegregation, as Derrick Bell put it, as a net “loss.”62¶ Given that poor and working-class whites (not white elites) were the ones who had their world rocked by desegregation, it does not take a great leap of empathy to see why affirmative action could be experienced as salt in a wound. Du Bois once observed that the psychological wage of whiteness put “an indelible black face to failure.”63 Yet with the advent of affirmative action, suddenly African Americans were leapfrogging over poor and working class whites on their way to Harvard and Yale and taking jobs in police departments and fire departments that had once been reserved for whites. ¶ Civil rights advocates offered no balm for the wound, publicly resisting calls for class-based affirmative action and dismissing claims of unfairness on the grounds that whites had been enjoying racial preferences for hundreds of years. Resentment, frustration, and anger expressed by poor and working-class whites was chalked up to racism, leading to a subterranean discourse about race and to implicitly racial political appeals, but little honest dialogue.¶ Perhaps the time has come to give up the racial bribes and begin an honest conversation about race in America. The topic of the conversation should be how us can come to include all of us. Accomplishing this degree of unity may mean giving up fierce defense of policies and strategies that exacerbate racial tensions and produce for racially defined groups primarily psychological or cosmetic racial benefits. ¶ Of course, if meaningful progress is to be made, whites must give up their racial bribes too, and be willing to sacrifi ce their racial privilege. Some might argue that in this game of chicken, whites should make the fi rst move. Whites should demonstrate that their silence in the drug war cannot be bought by tacit assurances that their sons and daughters will not be rounded up en masse and locked away. Whites should prove their commitment to dismantling not only mass incarceration, but all of the structures of racial inequality that guarantee for whites the resilience of white privilege. After all, why should “we” give up our racial bribes if whites have been unwilling to give up theirs? In light of our nation’s racial history, that seems profoundly unfair. But if your strategy for racial justice involves waiting for whites to be fair, history suggests it will be a long wait. It’s not that white people are more unjust than others. Rather it seems that an aspect of human nature is the tendency to cling tightly to one’s advantages and privileges and to rationalize the suffering and exclusion of others. This tendency is what led Frederick Douglass to declare that “power concedes nothing without a demand; it never has and it never will.” ¶ So what is to be demanded in this moment in our nation’s racial history? If the answer is more power, more top jobs, more slots in fancy schools for “us”—a narrow, racially defined us that excludes many—we will continue the same power struggles and can expect to achieve many of the same results. Yes, we may still manage to persuade mainstream voters in the midst of an economic crisis that we have relied too heavily on incarceration, that prisons are too expensive, and that drug use is a public health problem, not a crime. But if the movement that emerges to end mass incarceration does not meaningfully address the racial divisions and resentments that gave rise to mass incarceration, and if it fails to cultivate an ethic of genuine care, compassion, and concern for every human being—of every class, race, and nationality—within our nation’s borders, including poor whites, who are often pitted against poor people of color, the collapse of mass incarceration will not mean the death of racial caste in America. Inevitably a new system of racialized social control will emerge—one that we cannot foresee, just as the current system of mass incarceration was not predicted by anyone thirty years ago. No task is more urgent for racial justice advocates today than ensuring that America’s current racial caste system is its last.¶ Given what is at stake at this moment in history, bolder, more inspired action is required than we have seen to date. Piecemeal, top-down policy reform on criminal justice issues, combined with a racial justice discourse that revolves largely around the meaning of Barack Obama’s election and “postracialism,” will not get us out of our nation’s racial quagmire. We must flip the script. Taking our cue from the courageous civil rights advocates who brazenly refused to defend themselves, marching unarmed past white mobs that threatened to kill them, we, too, must be the change we hope to create. If we want to do more than just end mass incarceration—if we want to put an end to the history of racial caste in America—we must lay down our racial bribes, join hands with people of all colors who are not content to wait for change to trickle down, and say to those who would stand in our way: Accept all of us or none. ¶ That is the basic message that Martin Luther King Jr. aimed to deliver through the Poor People’s Movement back in 1968. He argued then that the time had come for racial justice advocates to shift from a civil rights to a human rights paradigm, and that the real work of movement building had only just begun.64 A human rights approach, he believed, would offer far greater hope for those of us determined to create a thriving, multiracial, multiethnic democracy free from racial hierarchy than the civil rights model had provided to date. It would offer a positive vision of what we can strive for—a society in which all human beings of all races are treated with dignity, and have the right to food, shelter, health care, education, and security.65 This expansive vision could open the door to meaningful alliances between poor and working-class people of all colors, who could begin to see their interests as aligned, rather than in conflict—no longer in competition for scarce resources in a zero-sum game.",9947.0,"<h4>Our approach to the War on Drugs must be <u>coalitional and inclusive</u>---their alt re-inscribes exclusive binaries, Alexander votes aff</h4><p>Michelle <strong>Alexander 10</strong>, associate professor of law at Stanford Law School, civil rights lawyer, advocate and legal scholar, The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, 2010, The New Press, p. 255-259</p><p><u>This brings us to a critical question: <mark>who is the us that</u></mark> civil rights <u><mark>advocates are fighting for?

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements. Eventually they too will be swept up in the multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized elements into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive network.",10047.0,"<h4>Their position is not mutually exclusive---we can embrace the 1AC while recognizing the 1NC’s method is important – voting aff affirms the transformational power of oppositional nodes in a network to resist structures and accelerate the fragmenting power of anti-hegemonic networks</h4><p><strong>Hardt 2</strong> – Prof. of Literature @ Duke & The European Graduate School, New Left Review, New Left Review 14, March-April 2002, </p><p><u>http://newleftreview.org/II/14/michael-hardt-porto-alegre-today-s-bandung</p><p></u>Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or <u><mark>one can strive towards a </mark>non-national <mark>alternative </mark>to the present form of globalization that is equally global.</u> The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more <u><mark>clearly posed against capital itself, </mark>whether state-regulated or not</u>. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. <u><mark>The division between </mark>the <mark>sovereignty, </mark>anti-globalization position <mark>and the non-sovereign, </mark>alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict<mark> corresponds </mark>rather <mark>to two different forms of political organization.</u></mark> The <u>traditional <mark>parties</u></mark> and centralized campaigns <u>generally <mark>occupy the </mark>national <mark>sovereignty pole</u></mark>, whereas the <u><mark>new movements organized in horizontal networks</u></mark> tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, <u><mark>neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution </mark>to the crisis </u>that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. <u><mark>They</u></mark> rather <u><mark>present different political strategies for action</u></mark> today <u><mark>which seek, </mark>in the course of time<mark>, to develop real alternatives to </mark>the current form of<mark> global rule.</mark> </u>Parties vs networks In a previous period <u><mark>we could</u></mark> have <u><mark>stage</u></mark>d <u><mark>an old</u></mark>-style ideological <u><mark>confrontation between the two positions</u></mark>.

This is just four months from now; however, they do not say what will happen one year from now based on their own, projective, logic.¶ If the current rate of transmission persists, with an exponential doubling time around 1 month, the human population will be infected to 2016. This will happen. There will be a thousand more cases in just 10 months…I’m being generous, or optimistic, here with the numbers: regardless, there will be a thousand more cases by the year’s end, and if there are 5000 cases by the middle of September 2014. It just grows exponentially from there: five million cases as of Sept 2015; 5 billion cases by Sept 2016, i.e. the total human population. At a 70 % mortality rate, only 2 billion people will survive, but the situation could be even worse if we take into account mutations of the virus and the consequences of a pandemic catastrophe.¶ There are a lot of very lethal viruses in the world, and Ebola is not the most lethal or most easy transmittable, but the main thing which makes me worry about it is the steadiness of its exponential infection curve.¶ The main stunning feature of it is that the curve is moving straight forward (small downward bump in May-June may be explained by the efforts of existing medical services in Africa to curb the epidemic before services had been overwhelmed). This exponential growth must be stopped, or humanity will face a global catastrophe, and it may start a downward spiral towards extinction;¶ moreover, some estimates suggest that pandemic doubling time is actually two weeks (because of underreporting of actual cases), so in five months, seven billion will be infected: total infection, by July 2015.¶ Read more here “Ebola cases doubling every two weeks in worst areas”. http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2014/s4089887.htm¶ These preliminary calculations show that risks of global catastrophe from Ebola should be under assessment.¶ Such catastrophes may not mean total human extinction, as only around 70% of people infected currently die from Ebola (and even less because we don’t know, or share, asymptomatic cases), but still, this means the end of the world as we know it. This virus is the first step towards the road of full extinction – see more below.¶ Some have said that Western countries are not under any risk because of their high quality medicine and sanitation, but success mostly depends on the way in which the virus mutates: this is a big unknown…Mutations of virus could lead to two bad things and one good. RNA viruses are known to mutate especially quick.¶ Bad viruses are airborne while the second one may take on many different forms of the virus. Good forms of the virus provide a milder form, which will dominate and provide immunity.¶ Risks of an evolving multi-pandemic¶ Let’s look first on the risk from many forms of the viruses. If the virus will mutate quickly, there will be many different strains of it, so it will ultimately create a multi-pandemic. (There are also many different strains of AIDS and TB, but they are rarely overlapping which may happen only when an entire population is exposed).¶ Some of the strains may became airborne, or have higher transmission rates, but the main risk from multi-pandemic is that it overcomes defenses provided by the natural variability of the human genome and immunity. (By the way, the human genome variability is very low because of the recent bottle neck in the history of our population. Any chimpanzee has more differentiation from another chimpanzee than human beings have between other human beings: Pygmies have more in common with Nordic blondes than chimps have with each other. http://theadvancedapes.com/201328great-ape-and-human-genetic-diversity/)¶ We are almost clones from the view point of genetic variability typical for natural populations.¶ The Human race is very unique – it has very large population but very small genetic diversity. It means that it is more susceptible to pandemics.¶ Also, a large homogenous population is ideal for breeding different strains of infection. There are no many natural examples of such large and homogeneous populations, in which exist high level of communication between all its parts (I mean global air travel).¶ Such populations of clones exist in the world of plants. Most of them are fine, but the population of one particular banana was completely wiped out by a specific rust (see more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_disease). All bananas of this specie were clones: Now we eat different bananas.¶ My point is that a large homogenous population is an ideal breeding ground for a multi-pandemic.¶ If the genetic diversity of a pathogen is bigger than human diversity, than it could cause a near total extinction, and also, large and homogenous populations help breed such a diversity of pathogens feeding on the population.¶ Risks of airborne Ebola¶ If we speak about airborne Ebola, in some experiments, it shows an ability to be transferred via air from monkey to monkey, but the problem is that existing ways of transmission may be very effective only if virus could survive long enough in dirty pieces of shit and blood. Airborne viruses, like the flu, live a very short time in the air, and it makes it easy to defend against them. See more here: http://virologydownunder.blogspot.com.au/2014/09/the-wind-beneath-my-ebola-virus.html¶ Several citation for more information:¶ “The Ebola virus can survive for several days outside the body”. http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ebola-virus/pages/ebola-virus.aspx¶ “It is infectious as breathable 0.8 to 1.2-μm laboratory-generated droplets” (wiki)¶ “Also many of the greatest plagues mankind has ever known were not airborne: e.g. smallpox. A mutation that made ebola transmissible before the visible onset of clear symptoms (i.e during the early febrile strage) would be just as problematic as airborne transmission and make contact tracing very much more difficult” (from flutrackers.com)¶ Bottleneck in vaccine production¶ We could have many new vaccines and drugs for Ebola by 2015, but the bottleneck here is in production, which should be at the same level of possible potential victims: hundreds millions in 2015. (“Ebola Epidemic Outpacing Vaccine Production”¶ http://en.ria.ru/analysis/20140919/193103190/Ebola-Epidemic-Outpacing-Vaccine-Production-.html)¶ Also, if virus mutate, it will make most drugs obsolete sooner than they will be developed, such as AIDS vaccines.¶ Problems with the response¶ Another problem is the lack of adequate responses from global authorities; they are half a year behind the situation. You can’t react to exponential threats “proportionally”. You must be several steps ahead.¶ Everything they do now should have been done half a year ago.¶ Unlimited exponential growth is a mark of potential global catastrophe: self-improving AI; nuclear chain reactions; self-replicating grey goo from nanobots; all examples are especially dangerous in a naïve environment. A large human population without immunity to Ebola, or any other Marburg style viruses, is fuel for exponential viral growth.¶ Direction of natural selection of Ebola virus¶ Ebola could evolve into a milder form as we may hope. Most pathogens do so only if it is favorable for transmission and such milder forms could also provide immunity. The Flu is most transmittable when it is mild: when someone goes out and coughs. Ebola is mostly transmittable only in hard cases when a person shits and bleeds uncontrollably, but it is also contagious from non-symptomatic people, so Ebola is not naturally selecting for mildness; it may do just the opposite. It may be selected for extreme and “fluid-like” dying.¶ Ebola as meme virus¶ Also Ebola seems to influence behavior zombie style, as late stage patients attack medical personal, run from quarantine or even bite someone—it happened in Nigeria and Liberia—the same can be said of rabies and toxoplasma.¶ Here we also should mention the meme aspect of the Ebola virus, which is the psychological stigma and fear associated with the disease. The fear has led to riots in Liberia, which additionally helped spread the virus. (See for example rumors that dead Ebola patients had resurrected http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12763%3Adead-ebola-patients-resurrect&catid=3%3Ageneral&Itemid=68)¶ So Ebola is also mimetic hazard, and the fear of it prevents rational control of the epidemic: people flee it, destroy hospitals, or they live in denial of it.¶ Other Ebola risk factors:¶ Also, the Ebola virus has natural host in African bats, but if it spreads over the world, it could find new natural hosts and create new reservoirs in nature, such as mice.¶ Most survivors are alive because they got some medical care from relatives and hospitals, and most new victims are the same relatives and nurses. This means mortality of the pandemic will grow in its late stages. Public restrooms may become the main place of contagion; especially, if victims became contagious long before they fail ill.¶ Ebola has a very long incubation period, estimated up to 21 days, and it also circulates in the blood after the illness for up to seven weeks. Men could infect women with their sperm months after the illness. It requires a very long and impractical quarantine.¶ From global catastrophe to human extinction¶ If Ebola slaughters most of the human population, hundred of millions of people will still survive the pandemic itself (if it will not become multi-pandemic with many different strains of Ebola-like viruses).¶ It will end technological civilization as we know it, and it probably start the self-sustainable process of destruction, which is the consequent failure of different institutions and technologies as well as wars and general disorder.

You must be several steps ahead.¶ Everything they do now should have been done half a year ago.¶ <u>Unlimited exponential growth is a mark of potential global catastrophe</u>: self-improving AI; nuclear chain reactions; self-replicating grey goo from nanobots; all examples are especially dangerous in a naïve environment. <u>A large human population without immunity to Ebola</u>, or any other Marburg style viruses, is fuel for exponential viral growth.¶ Direction of natural selection of Ebola virus¶ Ebola could evolve into a milder form as we may hope. Most pathogens do so only if it is favorable for transmission and such milder forms could also provide immunity. The Flu is most transmittable when it is mild: when someone goes out and coughs. Ebola is mostly transmittable only in hard cases when a person shits and bleeds uncontrollably, but it is also contagious from non-symptomatic people, so Ebola is not naturally selecting for mildness; it may do just the opposite. It may be selected for extreme and “fluid-like” dying.¶ Ebola as meme virus¶ Also Ebola seems to influence behavior zombie style, as late stage patients attack medical personal, run from quarantine or even bite someone—it happened in Nigeria and Liberia—the same can be said of rabies and toxoplasma.¶ Here we also should mention the meme aspect of the Ebola virus, which is the psychological stigma and fear associated with the disease. The fear has led to riots in Liberia, which additionally helped spread the virus. (See for example rumors that dead Ebola patients had resurrected http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12763%3Adead-ebola-patients-resurrect&catid=3%3Ageneral&Itemid=68)¶ So Ebola is also mimetic hazard, and the fear of it prevents rational control of the epidemic: people flee it, destroy hospitals, or they live in denial of it.¶ Other Ebola risk factors:¶ Also, the Ebola virus has natural host in African bats, but if it spreads over the world, it could find new natural hosts and create new reservoirs in nature, such as mice.¶ Most survivors are alive because they got some medical care from relatives and hospitals, and most new victims are the same relatives and nurses. This means mortality of the pandemic will grow in its late stages. Public restrooms may become the main place of contagion; especially, if victims became contagious long before they fail ill.¶ Ebola has a very long incubation period, estimated up to 21 days, and it also circulates in the blood after the illness for up to seven weeks. Men could infect women with their sperm months after the illness. <u><mark>It requires </mark>a very long and <mark>impractical quarantine</u></mark>.¶ <u>From global catastrophe to human extinction</u>¶ <u>If <mark>Ebola</mark> slaughters most of the human population, hundred of millions of people will still survive the pandemic itself</u> (if it will not become multi-pandemic with many different strains of Ebola-like viruses).¶ <u>It <mark>will end</mark> technological <mark>civilization as we know it, and</mark> it probably <mark>start</mark> the self-sustainable process of destruction, which is the consequent failure of different institutions and technologies as well as <mark>wars</mark> and general disorder. It may be a long term degradation process, which has its own logic and its bottom may be very far from now</u>.</p>",2AC,Treaties,Ebola Add-On,164241,20,18692,./documents/ndtceda14/Northwestern/MiVe/Northwestern-Miles-Vellayappan-Aff-Harvarddebate-Round1.docx,569582,A,Harvarddebate,1,"California, Berkeley Sergent-Leventhal-Wimsatt",Hester,"1AC Marijuana (CartelsTreaties)

They can’t start savings accounts. They don’t have checking accounts. They can’t get credit cards. They live in places where banks don’t want to go, and because of this, they remain effectively walled off from the global economy. They are called the unbanked. But they are not unreachable, not by a long shot, and one of the biggest and most exciting prospects bitcoiners talk about is using their cryptocurrency to bring these billions of people roaring into the twenty-first century.¶ The Caribbean is an area of the emerging-market world where a strong case can be made for locals to use bitcoin to get around a restrictive financial system. ¶ Jamal Ifill, a young, soft-spoken artist with a head full of dreadlocked hair and a warm smile, has been blowing glass in Barbados for 11 years and has had his own one-room studio-cum-showroom for five years. One of his latest pieces is a two-foot-high, rectangular, latticework lamp that to our New York eyes looked like one of the Twin Towers. He sells his artwork locally and has attracted some attention; a piece he made was presented to Prin­cess Anne when she visited the island in 2011. He wants to expand into the U.S. market, but the logistics and costs of moving money from there to here are prohibitively high, so most of his business remains local. ¶ “I tried everything,” Ifill says, sitting at the desk that doubles as his office and workspace in his small glass-blowing studio in Bridgetown, Barbados. “Credit cards, PayPal, Western Union. They’re too expensive.” ¶ Leroy McClain, managing director of the government-run Barbados Investment Development Corp., explained why that is: The big international banks are happy to provide merchant-banking services to companies in the United States and Canada, but they make island businesses jump through far more hoops for the same services.¶ Ifill understands the problem all too well. In fact, he has all the problems of an international business. The partic­ular glass he uses must be imported from Ukraine. His customers are not only on the island, but overseas. He is competing with foreign artists who aren’t hamstrung by the costs that tie him up. He tried e-commerce—through a local company—but gave up on it because not enough customers were using it, which meant he wasn’t getting any business out of it. A vicious circle. “I even tried Etsy,” he says, the online arts-and-craft site. Again, he couldn’t compete on costs with U.S. artists.¶ Ifill’s problem stems in part from the difficulty in shifting money around the region’s island nations, which requires constant and costly currency exchanges. Barbados and virtually every nation in the British West Indies has its own, sepa­rately printed currency—each called the dollar, each fluctuating in value against the others and against the better-known U.S. dollar. And the for­mer Spanish, Dutch, and French colonies all have their own pesos, guil­ders, and gourdes. The governments of the region have long talked about creating a monetary union to deepen the region’s free-trade arrangement, the Caricom common market. But as with the development of that free-trade area, progress toward building a single monetary authority and the other institutions needed for a common currency has been fitful. A Caribbean dollar remains a pipe dream.¶ To make matters worse, a number of central banks impose capital controls on their citizens. Barbadians such as Ifill, for in­stance, are limited in the amount of foreign currency they can buy. That Barbados, the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas, and other Caribbean na­tions serve as tax havens for hedge funds and other foreign financial in­stitutions is an irony not lost on the region’s tightly controlled residents. This mix of monetary systems and financial regulations, and the frustration that it breeds, make the sunny islands of the Caribbean ripe for bitcoin—or so says Gabriel Abed.¶ Abed, 27, turned to cryptocurrencies as the answer to a problem: how to expand e-commerce. He is the CEO of Web Designs, a local business that sells Internet domain registrations, Web site designs, maintenance, and e-commerce platforms. The last has been a particularly tough sell. Because of the costs of foreign exchange, credit cards, and PayPal, which can add up to eight or nine percent, he said, most merchants—Ifill was one of them—simply avoid sell­ing abroad.¶ Abed learned of bitcoin early on and saw its potential to solve this problem. He began with the idea of a Caribbean cryptocurrency, which he dubbed CaribCoin, but realized quickly it was a bigger project than he wanted to take on. He pivoted to the idea of a bitcoin exchange, and a merchant service that he could bundle with his Web-design and hosting service, and began building Bitt (the URL is actually bi.tt, the .tt being the domain for neighboring Trinidad and Tobago). He also began mining his own bitcoins—in Trinidad, taking advantage of relatively low electricity costs there, and using the profits from that and from Web Designs to fund Bitt. ¶ Bitt is designed as a Caribbean-focused online exchange and mer­chant service, providing trading between different cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, as well as a module for helping local businesses adopt digi­tal currencies for payment. His appeal to them is simple: What if I can give you a payment option that costs only one percent?¶ The catch is that the one percent fee comes with bitcoins, which as of this writing can’t buy you much in Barbados. To say that cryptocurrencies are not big in Barbados would be an understatement. They effectively don’t exist on the island, and neither does mobile commerce. While vir­tually everybody has a cell phone, the proverbial badge of a digital citi­zen, people use them only for texting and talking. E-commerce is barely getting started, as is online banking.¶ The way to get over the chicken-and-egg problem and encourage adoption, Abed believes, is to focus on the merchants. He believes that if he can offer them a dramatically cheaper payment method, they can be talked into accepting that method at their shops. But he has his work cut out for him.¶ EARLY ADOPTERS¶ The chicken-and-egg dilemma will require incentives. The promise of saving money is certainly one of them. But there are others. As in the developed world, one hope is that if big firms or institutions whose relationships run deep in the economy start using bitcoin, they can create incentives for their suppliers and customers to use it.¶ Patrick Byrne, the CEO of Salt Lake City-based online retailer Over­stock.com, which began accepting bitcoin in early 2014 to become what was then the biggest revenue-earning merchant to do so, believes his firm can play such a catalytic role creating a bitcoin “ecosystem” in the devel­oping world.¶ When we met in June 2014 in Utah, Byrne explained that he viewed bitcoin as a way to widen economic opportunity, if only he could get people to accept it. He was still figuring out the carrots he would use, but he had some ideas. “In the world of payments and dealing with vendors, there’s all this sensitiv­ity around the terms of payment. Vendors will sometimes give you a two percent discount for shaving off 20 days, because to them that’s like a 36 percent cost of money over the year. That affects all kinds of things. The very fact that vendors offer those terms means there’s an enor­mous opportunity for bitcoin to step up in this area.” A few weeks later, Byrne announced he would not only be paying bitcoin-accepting vendors one week early, but that he’d also pay his employee bonuses in bitcoin. ¶ What companies such as Overstock are trying to do with digital-currency payments has parallels with what Walmart achieved by pio­neering communications technology to revolutionize supply-chain management in the 1990s and early 2000s. The Arkansas-based retailer famously developed a sophisticated network with which to tie all of its suppliers worldwide into a single, integrated database for managing the goods and services flowing in and out of Walmart’s warehouses. Along with big improvements in shipping logistics, this allowed the company to optimize its just-in-time inventory management, which drastically cut costs. Walmart parlayed those cost savings into the cheapest prices any­where in the United States, which turned it into the iconic and, to some, infamous behemoth that now dominates American suburbia. ¶ Just as im­portant, its high-tech network had a feedback effect on suppliers, contrib­uting to the concentration of manufacturing in hubs such as China’s Pearl River Delta. As Walmart became an increasingly powerful but relentless hunter of the cheapest manufacturing sources, and as other Western buy­ers caught on to its high-tech lead, factories paying low wages in the de­veloping world would congregate in locales where it was most efficient to tap into Walmart’s network. Byrne now sees similar opportunities for firms like his to build influence by leveraging bitcoin in its international payment relationships and thus creating a tipping point from which change starts rippling over the global economy. As a group of businesses in one region begins adopting the currency, it will become more appealing to others with whom they do business. Once such a network of intertwined businesses builds up, no one wants to be excluded from it. Or so the theory goes.¶ “Just as American retail collapsed into Walmart, who knows how much can collapse into us? And I don’t mean Overstock. I mean bitcoin,” Byrne said. “You start getting network effects. You are incentivizing everyone—it’s like we have the first fax machine but nobody else has a fax machine, so it doesn’t do you any good. But you start adding other nodes and making incentives to add nodes and eventually get a critical mass. Now people aren’t just faxing us, they are faxing each other.”",10096.0,"<h4>And, Bitcoin expansion’s key to <u>massive Caribbean economic growth</h4><p></u>Paul <strong>Vigna 2/26</strong>, with Michael J.

The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur it is unnecessary A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases","Stem-cell treatment it is critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power to regulate medicine, where it is ill-equipped to intervene.

It is also common ground in the medical profession that so-called “allogenic” treatments, whereby stem-cells from one person are ultimately transferred into the body of another, run the risk of immunological rejection by the recipient. The preferred road to medical advance lies therefore through “autologous” transfers that remove your own cells, which are then manipulated under laboratory conditions to grow new tissue forms that can then be reinjected into your body to restore its lost function.¶ Regenerative Sciences uses its “Cultured Regenexx Procedure” for treating patients suffering from certain musculoskeletal damage, including those arising from athletic injuries, like those suffered by professional athletes, who have every incentive to select the right treatment. Like all stem-cell treatments, the Regenerative Science protocol required the standard autologous treatment that requires your cells to be grown and concentrated before being reinjected into the body at the site of damaged joints.¶ Regenerative Sciences’ track record of successes led large numbers of patients to beat a path to its door. But that same success also attracted FDA attention in 2008 when Mary A. Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:¶ Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.¶ A small medical practice like Regenerative Science cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.¶ The FDA’s Power¶ Ms. Malarkey’s letter bases the FDA’s power on the fact that the new technology affects “interstate commerce.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.¶ Judge Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research.¶ Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”¶ These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.¶ The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.¶ Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.¶ Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.¶ Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.¶ But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. But that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do.¶ In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.¶ Bad Policy¶ In addition to being bad law, the FDA decision represents bad policy. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell procedure had to go through the FDA gauntlet.¶ Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. The business would come to a screeching halt if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur.¶ And it is all so unnecessary. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.¶ A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention. It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But the courts are well within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into the regulation of medical practice in stem cell cases.",9935.0,"<h4>The plan narrows the Commerce Clause---<u>prevents FDA over-regulation</u> and chilling of stem cell research</h4><p>Richard A. <strong>Epstein 13</strong>, Visiting Scholar at the Manhattan Institute, ""Government Overreach Threatens Lives"", October 1, www.hoover.org/research/government-overreach-threatens-lives</p><p><u><mark>Stem-cell treatment</u></mark>.¶ In light of all these difficulties, <u><mark>it is</u></mark> absolutely <u><mark>critical that the FDA should not be allowed to extend its power</mark> over new drugs and devices <mark>to regulate</mark> the practice of <mark>medicine, where it is</u></mark> singularly <u><mark>ill-equipped to intervene.

Malarkey, director of the Office of Compliance and Biologics Quality at the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research at the FDA, delivered a a letter to the firm, which shut its activities down:¶ Please be advised that in order to introduce or deliver for introduction a drug that is also a biological product into interstate commerce, a valid biologics license must be in effect. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product’s intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application in effect as specified by FDA regulations.¶ <u><mark>A small</mark> medical <mark>practice </mark>like Regenerative Science <mark>cannot hope to recover through its medical practice the huge-front end costs </mark>that often prove too much to bear from large well-capitalized pharmaceutical companies</u>. But rather than fold its tent, Regenerative Sciences challenged the FDA in court in ways that put the agency’s powers and wisdom in the spotlight. Let us take these matters up in order.¶ The FDA’s Power¶ Ms. <u><mark>Malarkey</mark>’s letter <mark>bases the FDA’s power on</mark> the fact that the new technology affects “<mark>interstate commerce</u></mark>.” As a matter of plain English, her approach is surely wrong-headed because every stage of Regenerative Sciences treatment took place within the state of Colorado.¶ Judge <u>Collyer’s answer to that interpretive issue lies in the modern jurisprudence of Article I the Commerce Clause—“Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations, among the several states and with the Indian tribes.” <mark>That Clause received an indefensibly broad reading</u></mark> in the key New Deal decision Wickard v. Filburn, <u>where the Supreme Court allowed Congress to regulate purely local activities within a given state that, when aggregated, influenced the total level of national economic activity—which is surely the case with respect to stem-cell research</u>.¶ Yet by running first to the Constitution, Judge Collyer never addressed the key statutory provisions, which tell a different tale. Under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, “The term ‘interstate commerce’ means (1) commerce between any State or Territory and any place outside therefore, and (2) commerce within the District of Columbia or within any other Territory not organized with a legislative body.” Similarly, the Public Health Service Act authorizes the FDA to make rules and regulations “to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.”¶ These key definitions of commerce and communicable diseases were not chosen at random. Historically, they reflect the pre-New Deal vision that the FDA’s jurisdiction only reaches those drugs that actually move in interstate commerce, where they present a risk of communicable diseases. The statutory language consciously reflects the 1903 Supreme Court decision in Champion v. Ames, where the Supreme Court by a five-to-four vote found that Congress had—under the Commerce Clause—the power to prohibit the movement of lottery tickets in interstate commerce.¶ The decision was notable for two reasons. First, it was consistent with the then well-established rule that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of lottery tickets or indeed anything else. Second, it was a limited power insofar as it left it unclear whether Congress could prohibit the sale of any good in interstate commerce, a position that was widely rejected prior to the Civil War.¶ Champion exerted a powerful influence over the shape of the 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act, which gave Congress the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the territories while denying it the power to regulate the manufacture of drugs within the states. At the same time, it seized on Champion to allow Congress to prohibit, if need be, the shipment of drugs in interstate commerce.¶ Those limitations were carried forward into the 1938 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, where they functioned just as they did in the earlier statute. It takes therefore an extraordinary level of judicial imagination to take a statute intended to prevent the shipment of some dangerous substances in interstate commerce and use it to regulate the growth of new substances that pose no threat of a communicable disease within the state.¶ <u>Under the statute, however, it is not enough that some product used in the course of this stem cell procedure had moved in interstate commerce, even if it did pose any threat of a communicable disease</u>. To be sure, these products could, if improperly prepared, result in the spread of some communicable disease.¶ <u>But so too could standard surgeries which present that risk whenever physicians fail to wash their hands</u> during a routine procedure—a topic that has been vividly illustrated in Atul Gawande’s 2007 New Yorker masterpiece The Check List. <u>But <mark>that point proves too much: by its logic, it would allow the FDA to regulate the entire practice of medicine</mark> so long as the doctors used products brought in from out of state—which doctors always do</u>.¶ In its 1997 report on Proposed Approach to Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products, the FDA sought, at least for the moment, to limit the potential scope of its power by insisting that it only sought to exert control over “the cells or tissues [that] are…more-than-minimally, manipulated,” which covers all autologous stem cell procedures. But that “more than minimally” language bears no relationship to any portion of the relevant statutory text. Nor does the use of that phrase explain why this stem-cell procedure is not a text-book instance of the practice of medicine.¶ Bad Policy¶ <u>In addition to being bad law, <mark>the FDA decision represents bad policy</mark>. The stem-cell practice may well pose some patient dangers, but that is far more true of other forms of surgery that have life-threatening implications. Yet the FDA has not regulated other forms of surgery that have shown staggering advances at every level without its intervention. It is today bad enough that the FDA regulates medical devices, but <mark>it would be a serious setback to medical innovation if each stem-cell </mark>procedure <mark>had to go through the FDA </mark>gauntlet</u>.¶ Surgery is half science and half art. The procedures that are used at any time will be modified countless times within very short periods. Right now, it is only a combination of hunch, experience, and collaboration that indicate which new techniques are applied and which older ones are rejected. And this is how it should be. <u><mark>The business would come to a screeching halt</mark> if the FDA took it upon itself to insist that each and every one of these changes could only be done with its imprimatur</u>.¶ And <u>it is</u> all so <u>unnecessary</u>. At the time Ms. Malarkey wrote her letter, Regenerative Sciences had already built up a track record of performance that the FDA could have investigated before dropping its regulatory bomb on the company. But information like that is irrelevant to the FDA, which only thinks in terms of its powers, without bothering to ask whether there is actually a problem to fix.¶ <u>A far better approach is for the FDA to stay its hand in all cases until there is some evidence of mishap that calls for its intervention.</u> It is the same story all over again. The FDA is keenly cognizant of its own powers, but largely oblivious to its own institutional weaknesses. <u>In dealing with drugs and medical devices it may take a revitalized Congress to rein it in. But <mark>the courts are </mark>well <mark>within their power in striking down the FDA’s unwise venture into</mark> the regulation of medical practice in <mark>stem cell</mark> case<mark>s</u></mark>.</p>",1AC – Wake Round 2,,1AC – Commerce Clause Advantage,432708,14,18734,./documents/ndtceda14/Northwestern/MiVe/Northwestern-Miles-Vellayappan-Aff-Wake-Round2.docx,569594,A,Wake,2,Georgia GH,Lincoln Garrett,"1AC Marijuana (Treaty  Commerce Clause)

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements. Eventually they too will be swept up in the multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized elements into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive network.",10047.0,"<h4>Not mutually exclusive – voting Aff affirms the transformational power of oppositional networks to accelerate the fragmenting power of anti-hegemonic networks – larger trajectory of reform can be understood as a strategy for political action</h4><p><strong>Hardt 2</strong> – Prof. of Literature @ Duke & The European Graduate School</p><p>New Left Review, New Left Review 14, March-April 2002, </p><p><u>http://newleftreview.org/II/14/michael-hardt-porto-alegre-today-s-bandung</p><p></u>Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements. Eventually they too will be swept up in the multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized elements into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive network.",10047.0,"<h4>Not mutually exclusive – voting Aff affirms the transformational power of oppositional networks to resist capital itself & accelerate the fragmenting power of anti-hegemonic networks – larger trajectory of reform can be understood as a strategy for political action</h4><p><strong>Hardt 2</strong> – Prof. of Literature @ Duke & The European Graduate School</p><p>New Left Review, New Left Review 14, March-April 2002, </p><p><u>http://newleftreview.org/II/14/michael-hardt-porto-alegre-today-s-bandung</p><p></u>Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough.

The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. <u>The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization.</u> The <u>traditional parties</u> and centralized campaigns <u>generally occupy the national sovereignty pole</u>, whereas the <u>new movements organized in horizontal networks</u> tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, <u>neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis </u>that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. <u>They</u> rather <u>present different <strong>political strategies for action</u></strong> today <u>which seek, in the course of time, to develop <strong>real alternatives to</strong> the current form of <strong>global rule.</strong> </u>Parties vs networks In a previous period <u>we could</u> have <u>stage</u>d <u>an old</u>-style ideological <u>confrontation between the two positions</u>. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. <u>Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state</u>. <u>And</u> the second <u>could reply that national regimes</u> and other forms of sovereignty, <u>corrupt</u> and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization.

One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements. Eventually they too will be swept up in the multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized elements into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive network.",10047.0,"<h4>networked resistance solves the hegemony of oppressive structures<strong> </h4><p>Hardt 2</strong> – Prof. of Literature @ Duke & The European Graduate School</p><p>New Left Review, New Left Review 14, March-April 2002, </p><p><u>http://newleftreview.org/II/14/michael-hardt-porto-alegre-today-s-bandung</p><p></u>Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough.

The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization.</u> The <u>traditional parties</u> and centralized campaigns <u>generally occupy the national sovereignty pole</u>, whereas the <u>new movements organized in horizontal networks</u> tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, <u>neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis </u>that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. <u>They</u> rather <u>present different <strong>political strategies for action</u></strong> today <u>which seek, in the course of time, to develop <strong>real alternatives to</strong> the current form of <strong>global rule.</strong> </u>Parties vs networks In a previous period <u>we could</u> have <u>stage</u>d <u>an old</u>-style ideological <u>confrontation between the two positions</u>. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. <u>Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state</u>. <u>And</u> the second <u>could reply that national regimes</u> and other forms of sovereignty, <u>corrupt</u> and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions.

The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements.

The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. <u>The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization.</u> The <u>traditional parties</u> and centralized campaigns <u>generally occupy the national sovereignty pole</u>, whereas the <u>new movements organized in horizontal networks</u> tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, <u>neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis </u>that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. <u>They</u> rather <u>present different <strong>political strategies for action</u></strong> today <u>which seek, in the course of time, to develop <strong>real alternatives to</strong> the current form of <strong>global rule.</strong> </u>Parties vs networks In a previous period <u>we could</u> have <u>stage</u>d <u>an old</u>-style ideological <u>confrontation between the two positions</u>. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. <u>Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state</u>. <u>And</u> the second <u>could reply that national regimes</u> and other forms of sovereignty, <u>corrupt</u> and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections.

The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre.

Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough. The most important political difference cutting across the entire Forum concerned the role of national sovereignty. There are indeed two primary positons in the response to today’s dominant forces of globalization: either one can work to reinforce the sovereignty of nation-states as a defensive barrier against the control of foreign and global capital, or one can strive towards a non-national alternative to the present form of globalization that is equally global. The first poses neoliberalism as the primary analytical category, viewing the enemy as unrestricted global capitalist activity with weak state controls; the second is more clearly posed against capital itself, whether state-regulated or not. The first might rightly be called an antiglobalization posit on, in so far as national sovereignties, even if linked by international solidarity, serve to limit and regulate the forces of capitalist globalization. National liberation thus remains for this posit on the ultimate goal, as it was for the old anticolonial and anti-imperialist struggles. The second, in contrast, opposes any national solutions and seeks instead a democratic globalization. The first position occupied the most visible and dominant spaces of the Porto Alegre Forum; it was represented in the large plenary sessions, repeated by the official spokespeople, and reported in the press. A key proponent of this position was the leadership of the Brazilian PT (Workers' Party)—in effect the host of the Forum, since it runs the city and regional government. It was obvious and inevitable that the PT would occupy a central space in the Forum and use the international prestige of the event as part of its campaign strategy for the upcoming elections. The second dominant voice of national sovereignty was the French leadership of ATTAC, which laid the groundwork for the Forum in the pages of Le Monde Diplomatique. The leadership of ATTAC is, in this regard, very close to many of the French politicians— most notably Jean-Pierre Chevenement—who advocate strengthening national sovereignty as a solution to the ills of contemporary globalization. These, in any case, are the figures who dominated the representation of the Forum both internally and in the press. The non-sovereign, alternative globalization position, in contrast, was minoritarian at the Forum—not in quantitative terms but in terms of representation; in fact, the majority of the participants in the Forum may well have occupied this minoritarian position. First, the various movements that have conducted the protests from Seattle to Genoa are generally oriented towards non-national solutions. Indeed, the centralized structure of state sovereignty itself runs counter to the horizontal network-form that the movements have developed. Second, the Argentinian movements that have sprung up in response to the present financial crisis, organized in neighbourhood and city-wide delegate assemblies, are similarly antagonistic to proposals of national sovereignty. Their slogans call for getting rid, not just of one politician, but all of them—que se vayan todos: the entire political class. And finally, at the base of the various parties and organizations present at the Forum the sentiment is much more hostile to proposals of national sovereignty than at the top. This may be particularly true of ATTAC, a hybrid organization whose head, especially in France, mingles with traditional politicians, whereas its feet are firmly grounded in the movements. The division between the sovereignty, anti-globalization position and the non-sovereign, alternative globalization position is therefore not best understood in geographical terms. It does not map the divisions between North and South or First World and Third. The conflict corresponds rather to two different forms of political organization. The traditional parties and centralized campaigns generally occupy the national sovereignty pole, whereas the new movements organized in horizontal networks tend to cluster at the non-sovereign pole. And furthermore, within traditional, centralized organizations, the top tends toward sovereignty and the base away. It is no surprise, perhaps, that those in positions of power would be most interested in state sovereignty and those excluded least. This may help to explain, in any case, how the national sovereignty, antiglobalization position could dominate the representations of the Forum even though the majority of the participants tend rather toward the perspective of a non-national alternative globalization. As a concrete illustration of this political and ideological difference, one can imagine the responses to the current economic crisis in Argentina that logically follow from each of these positions. Indeed that crisis loomed over the entire Forum, like a threatening premonition of a chain of economic disasters to come. The first position would point to the fact that the Argentinian debacle was caused by the forces of global capital and the policies of the IMF, along with the other supranational institutions that undermine national sovereignty. The logical oppositional response should thus be to reinforce the national sovereignty of Argentina (and other nation-states) against these destabilizing external forces. The second position would identify the same causes of the crisis, but insist that a national solution is neither possible nor desirable. The alternative to the rule of global capital and its institutions will only be found at an equally global level, by a global democratic movement. The practical experiments in democracy taking place today at neighbourhood and city levels in Argentina, for example, pose a necessary continuity between the democratization of Argentina and the democratization of the global system. Of course, neither of these perspectives provides an adequate recipe for an immediate solution to the crisis that would circumvent IMF prescriptions—and I am not convinced that such a solution exists. They rather present different political strategies for action today which seek, in the course of time, to develop real alternatives to the current form of global rule. Parties vs networks In a previous period we could have staged an old-style ideological confrontation between the two positions. The first could accuse the second of playing into the hands of neoliberalism, undermining state sovereignty and paving the way for further globalization. Politics, the one could continue, can only be effectively conducted on the national terrain and within the nation-state. And the second could reply that national regimes and other forms of sovereignty, corrupt and oppressive as they are, are merely obstacles to the global democracy that we seek. This kind of confrontation, however, could not take place at Porto Alegre—in part because of the dispersive nature of the event, which tended to displace conflicts, and in part because the sovereignty position so successfully occupied the central representations that no contest was possible. But the more important reason for a lack of confrontation may have had to do with the organizational forms that correspond to the two positions. The traditional parties and centralized organizations have spokespeople who represent them and conduct their battles, but no one speaks for a network. How do you argue with a network? The movements organized within them do exert their power, but they do not proceed through oppositions. One of the basic characteristics of the network form is that no two nodes face each other in contradiction; rather, they are always triangulated by a third, and then a fourth, and then by an indefinite number of others in the web. This is one of the characteristics of the Seattle events that we have had the most trouble understanding: groups which we thought in objective contradiction to one another—environmentalists and trade unions, church groups and anarchists—were suddenly able to work together, in the context of the network of the multitude. The movements, to take a slightly different perspective, function something like a public sphere, in the sense that they can allow full expression of differences within the common context of open exchange. But that does not mean that networks are passive. They displace contradictions and operate instead a kind of alchemy, or rather a sea change, the flow of the movements transforming the traditional fixed positions; networks imposing their force through a kind of irresistible undertow. Like the Forum itself, the multitude in the movements is always overflowing, excessive and unknowable. It is certainly important then, on the one hand, to recognize the differences that divide the activists and politicians gathered at Porto Alegre. It would be a mistake, on the other hand, to try to read the division according to the traditional model of ideological conflict between opposing sides. Political struggle in the age of network movements no longer works that way. Despite the apparent strength of those who occupied centre stage and dominated the representations of the Forum, they may ultimately prove to have lost the struggle. Perhaps the representatives of the traditional parties and centralized organizations at Porto Alegre are too much like the old national leaders gathered at Bandung—imagine Lula of the PT in the position of Ahmed Sukarno as host, and Bernard Cassen of ATTAC France as Jawaharlal Nehru, the most honoured guest. The leaders can certainly craft resolutions affirming national sovereignty around a conference table, but they can never grasp the democratic power of the movements. Eventually they too will be swept up in the multitude, which is capable of transforming all fixed and centralized elements into so many more nodes in its indefinitely expansive network.",10047.0,"<h4>Not mutually exclusive – voting Aff affirms the transformational power of oppositional networks to resist capital itself & accelerate the fragmenting power of anti-hegemonic networks – larger trajectory of reform can be understood as a strategy for political action</h4><p><strong>Hardt 2</strong> – Prof. of Literature @ Duke & The European Graduate School</p><p>New Left Review, New Left Review 14, March-April 2002, </p><p><u>http://newleftreview.org/II/14/michael-hardt-porto-alegre-today-s-bandung</p><p></u>Anti-capitalism and national sovereignty The Porto Alegre Forum was in this sense perhaps to happy, to celebratory and not conflictual enough.

Brown (1995) positions herself within thedebate about identity politics by seeking to elaborate on “the wounded character of politicised identity’s desire” (ibid: 55); thatis, the problem of “wounded attachments” whereby a claim to identity becomes over-invested in its own historical suffering and perpetuates its injury through its refusal to give up its identity claim. Brown’s argument is that where politicised identity is founded upon an experience of exclusion, for example, exclusion itself becomes perversely valorised in the continuance of that identity. In such cases, group activity operates to maintain and reproduce the identity created by injury (exclusion) rather than– and indeed, often in opposition to – resolving the injurious social relations that generated claims around that identity in the ﬁrst place. If things have to have a history in order to have af uture, then the problem becomes that of how history is con-structed in order to make the future. To the extent that, for Brown, identity is associated primarily with (historical) injury, the future for that identity is then already determined by the injury “as both bound to the history that produced it and as a reproach to the present which embodies that history” (ibid 1995: 73). Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. Politicised identity, Brown maintains, “emerges and obtains its unifying coherence through the politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal, as a protest against exclusion” (ibid: 65). Its continuing existence requires both a belief in the legitimacy of the universal ideal (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) and enduring exclusion from those ideals. Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that such identi-ties, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment andinequality, then become invested in their own impotence through practices of, for example, reproach, complaint, and revenge. These are “reactions” in the Nietzschean sense since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. Rather than acting to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering is instead ameliorated (to some extent) through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue” (ibid 1995:70), and is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimnation. Such practices, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, provide obstacles to – practices that would seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion. Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past. This is because for those who have suffered oppression and exclusion, the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible to meet. We would argue instead that the “turn to the future” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting.

As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “in order to break the seal of the past, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, we must ﬁrst bring them into the realm of political action” (2004: 33). We would add that the task of analys-ing the traumatic past, and thus opening up the possibility of political action, is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but that this, instead, requires a “community” of participants dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. The “pain” of historical injury is not simply an individual psychological issue, but stems from objective social conditions which perpetuate, for the most part, forms of injustice and inequality into the present.

Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. <u>Politicised identity</u>, Brown maintains, “emerges and <u>obtains its unifying coherence through the <strong>politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal</strong>, as a protest against exclusion</u>” (ibid: 65). <u><mark>Its</mark> continuing <mark>existence requires</mark> both a belief in <mark>the legitimacy of the</mark> <mark>universal ideal</u></mark> (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) <u><mark>and</mark> enduring <mark>exclusion from those ideals</mark>.</u> Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that <u><strong><mark>such identi-ties</mark>, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment </u></strong>andinequality, then <u><strong><mark>become invested in their</mark> own <mark>impotence through</mark> practices of</u></strong>, for example, reproach, complaint, and <u><strong><mark>revenge</u></strong></mark>. <u>These are “reactions</u>” in the Nietzschean sense <u>since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. <strong><mark>Rather than acting</mark> <mark>to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering</mark> is instead ameliorated</u></strong> (to some extent) <u><strong>through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue</u></strong>” (ibid 1995:70), <u><strong>and <mark>is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimnation</u></strong>. <u><strong>Such</u></strong> <u><strong>practices</u></strong></mark>, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, <u><strong><mark>provide obstacles to</u></strong></mark> – <u><strong><mark>practices that </u></strong></mark>would<u><strong> <mark>seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion.</mark> </u></strong>Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), <u>we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past</u>. This is because <u>for those who have suffered oppression</u> and exclusion, <u>the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible</u> to meet. We would argue instead that the “<u><strong><mark>turn to the future</u></strong></mark>” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, <u><strong><mark>need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past</u></strong></mark>. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that <u>this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche</u>” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that <u>remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient,</u> who is <u>doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget</u> <u>and to forget in order to be able to live in the present.</u> 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past.

Brown (1995) positions herself within thedebate about identity politics by seeking to elaborate on “the wounded character of politicised identity’s desire” (ibid: 55); thatis, the problem of “wounded attachments” whereby a claim to identity becomes over-invested in its own historical suffering and perpetuates its injury through its refusal to give up its identity claim. Brown’s argument is that where politicised identity is founded upon an experience of exclusion, for example, exclusion itself becomes perversely valorised in the continuance of that identity. In such cases, group activity operates to maintain and reproduce the identity created by injury (exclusion) rather than– and indeed, often in opposition to – resolving the injurious social relations that generated claims around that identity in the ﬁrst place. If things have to have a history in order to have af uture, then the problem becomes that of how history is con-structed in order to make the future. To the extent that, for Brown, identity is associated primarily with (historical) injury, the future for that identity is then already determined by the injury “as both bound to the history that produced it and as a reproach to the present which embodies that history” (ibid 1995: 73). Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. Politicised identity, Brown maintains, “emerges and obtains its unifying coherence through the politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal, as a protest against exclusion” (ibid: 65). Its continuing existence requires both a belief in the legitimacy of the universal ideal (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) and enduring exclusion from those ideals. Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that such identi-ties, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment andinequality, then become invested in their own impotence through practices of, for example, reproach, complaint, and revenge. These are “reactions” in the Nietzschean sense since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. Rather than acting to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering is instead ameliorated (to some extent) through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue” (ibid 1995:70), and is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimnation. Such practices, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, provide obstacles to – practices that would seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion. Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures.

Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. <u>Politicised identity</u>, Brown maintains, “emerges and <u>obtains its unifying coherence through the <strong>politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal</strong>, as a protest against exclusion</u>” (ibid: 65). <u><mark>Its</mark> continuing <mark>existence requires</mark> both a belief in <mark>the legitimacy of the</mark> <mark>universal ideal</u></mark> (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) <u><mark>and</mark> enduring <mark>exclusion from those ideals</mark>.</u> Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that <u><strong><mark>such identi-ties</mark>, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment </u></strong>andinequality, then <u><strong><mark>become invested in their</mark> own <mark>impotence through</mark> practices of</u></strong>, for example, reproach, complaint, and <u><strong><mark>revenge</u></strong></mark>. <u>These are “reactions</u>” in the Nietzschean sense <u>since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. <strong><mark>Rather than acting</mark> <mark>to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering</mark> is instead ameliorated</u></strong> (to some extent) <u><strong>through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue</u></strong>” (ibid 1995:70), <u><strong>and <mark>is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimnation</u></strong>. <u><strong>Such</u></strong> <u><strong>practices</u></strong></mark>, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, <u><strong><mark>provide obstacles to</u></strong></mark> – <u><strong><mark>practices that </u></strong></mark>would<u><strong> <mark>seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion.</mark> </u></strong>Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), <u>we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past</u>. This is because <u>for those who have suffered oppression</u> and exclusion, <u>the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible</u> to meet. We would argue instead that the “<u><strong><mark>turn to the future</u></strong></mark>” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, <u><strong><mark>need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past</u></strong></mark>. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that <u>this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche</u>” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that <u>remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient,</u> who is <u>doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget</u> <u>and to forget in order to be able to live in the present.</u> 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past. Indeed, this wouldseem to be similar to the message of Beloved , whose central motif of haunting (is the adult woman, “Beloved”, Sethe’s murderedchild returned in spectral form?) dramatises the tendency of theunanalysed traumatic past to keep on returning, constraining, asit does so, the present to be like the past, and thereby, disallow-ing the possibility of a future different from that past. As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “<u><strong><mark>in order to break the seal of the past</u></strong></mark>, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, <u><strong><mark>we must</mark> ﬁrst <mark>bring them into the realm of political action</u></strong></mark>” (2004: 33). We would add that <u>the task of analys-ing the traumatic past, and</u> thus <u><mark>opening</mark> up the possibility of <mark>political action, </mark>is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but that this, instead, <mark>requires a “community” of participants</u></mark> dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. <u><mark>The “pain” of historical injury is <strong>not simply an individual psychological issue</strong>, but stems from</mark> objective <mark>social conditions which perpetuate</mark>, for the most part, forms of <mark>injustice</mark> and inequality into the present. </u>In sum, Brown presents too stark a choice between past andfuture. In the example of Beloved with which we began thisarticle, Paul D’s acceptance of Sethe’s experiences of slavery asdistinct from his own, enable them both to arrive at new under-standings of their experience. Such understanding is a way of partially “undoing” the (effects of) the past and coming to terms with the locatedness of one’s being in the world (Mohanty 1995). As this example shows, opening up a future, and attending to theongoing effects of a traumatic past, are only incorrectly under-stood as alternatives. A second set of problems with Brown’s critique of identity poli-tics emerge from what we regard as her tendency to individualise social problems as problems that are the possession and theresponsibility of the “wounded” group. Brown suggests that <u>the problems associated with identity politics can be overcome through a “shift in the character of political expression</u> and politi-cal claims common to much politicised identity” (1995: 75). She deﬁnes this shift as one <u>in which identity would be expressed in terms of <strong>desire rather than of ontology by supplanting the lan-guage of “I am” with the language of “I want this for us” </u></strong>(1995:75). Such a reconﬁguration, she argues, would create an opportu-nity to “rehabilitate the memory of desire within identiﬁcatory processes…prior to [their] wounding” (1995: 75). <u><strong>It would fur-ther refocus attention on the future possibilities present in theidentity as opposed to the identity being foreclosed through its attention to past-based grievances</u></strong>.</p>",,,Case,127857,114,19031,./documents/ndtceda14/Trinity/VaTo/Trinity-Vargas-Torres-Neg-Weberswing-Round2.docx,570341,N,Weberswing,2,Kansas State Pena-Ramirez,Montee,"1AC - Decolonial Prositution

Local innovations are interlinked with global policy most important are the interactions between different levels of social actor and of the institutions that give shape to social systems","(Mette F., Department of Geology and Geography at the University of Copenhagen, Daivi Rodima-Taylor, African Studies Centre, Boston University, “Adaptation as innovation, innovation as adaptation: An institutional approach to climate change,” Applied Geography, 2011).
While there is an increasing recognition that many adaptation actions are local and build off experience of managing past climatic risks (Christoplos et al.. 2009). There can be barriers and limitations to adaptation. These can come from several fronts including inadequate climate information (Deressa, Hassan, Ringler. Alemu, 82. Yesuf, 2009), partial understanding of climate impacts and uncertainty about benefits of adaptation (Hammill 82 Tanner. 2011), institutional inertia and lock-in (path dependency) (Chhetri, Easterling. Terando. 82 Meams. 2010). disconnect between climate science and policy leading to a lack of use-inspired research (Moser, 2010), insufficient credit access (Bryan. Deressa. Gbetibouo. 82. Ringler. 2009). and weak market systems (Kabubo-Mariara 2009). By using the conceptual infrastructure of the hypothesis of induced innovation, such as done by Chhetri et al., in this issue, researchers can extend the boundaries of climate change research to take into consideration the role of institutions in the innovation and delivery of technologies to enhance the adaptive capacity of a society. The hypothesis of induced innovation refers to the process by which societies develop technologies that facilitate the substitution of relatively abundant (hence, cheap) factors of production for relatively scarce (hence, expensive) factors in the economy (Hayami 82 Ruttan. 1985) The concept has earned recognition in climate adaptation and has been used to explain the complex process of institutional and technological change (Koppel, 1995). While the role of climate as a stimulant for institutional and technological innovation is a difficult assumption to test (Abler. Shortle. Rose. 82 Oladosu. 2000), scholars have drawn on this hypothesis in explaining the possible relationships between change in resource endowment and the development of new institutional and technological arrangements (Easterling. 1996; Gitay. Brown. Easterling, 8: ]allow, 2001). Insights about the role of climate as a stimulus to innovation are therefore crucial to improving our understanding of adaptation to climate change. One of the most important insights of this hypothesis is that the innovation of technologies that are needed to respond to the emerging threat of climate is the function of change (or difference) in resource endowment and the ability of institutions to deliver technologies on demand (Chhetri 82 Easterling, 2010). Technological change is treated as being induced by institutional change (Koppel, 1995). Institutionalized research is therefore crucial for producing innovations leading to advanced technologies capable of making society resilient and adaptable. Institutional change, in turn, is treated as induced by changes in factor supplies (e.g.. land. water) and product demand (e.g.. food. health) and affected by techno- logical change (e.g.. high yielding varieties. better medicine) (Hayami 82 Ruttan. 1985). Institutions that lack the mandate and knowledge to implement climate-sensitive measures can diminish the adaptive capacity of the social-ecological system (Moser. 2009). The innovation of appropriate technologies therefore depends on the sensitivity of institutions to progressively respond to climate change. As climate changes there may be a more pronounced focus on wider partnerships between all stakeholders and on the co- production of knowledge. Nepal's evolving experience in dealing with the nation's dwindling food security has shown a demand for a broad participation of farmers and their supporting institutions in innovation of technologies. The research establishment in Nepal has developed novel multi-level institutional partnerships, including collaboration with farmers and non-governmental organizations at the critical stages of technological innovation (Chhetri et al.. in this issue). In their paper Chhetri et al. also show that existing centralized top-down institutions are increasingly being complemented and sometimes challenged by new forms of collaboration, including public-private partnerships and demand led collaboration. Yet, notwithstanding this recognition, there is a dearth of research that unravels the role of climate as a stimulus for the innovation of appropriate technologies (Ruttan, 1996; Smithers 82 Blay-Palmer. 2001). As the transition to a new and highly variable climate does not occur in an institutional vacuum (Agrawal. 2008. 2010) efforts to generate appropriate adaptation response require institutional arrangements that empower the stakeholders to co-produce the technologies needed to address the new challenges. The induced innovation framework enables the researchers to extend the boundaries of climate change research by taking into consideration the role of institutions in the innovation and delivery of technologies to enhance the adaptive capacity of the society. The impacts of climate change are already being observed, and because of a lag in natural systems, more and severe challenges are inevitable (Burton. Huq. ljrn. Pilifosova. 82. Schipper. 2002). At the heart of climate response strategies lies the issue of how smallholder farmers in developing countries cope with variable and unpredictable climate (Chn'stoplos et al.. 2009). Local communities and NGOs are demanding an increasingly active role of public institutions in the delivery of technological options to cope with emerging climate challenges (Prowse 8: Scott. 2008). Despite the importance accorded to the role of institutions in fostering adaptation, few researchers have investigated how the challenges of managing natural resources may induce new forms of institutional arrangement that can facilitate adaptation to climate change. Much of the attention on the effects of climate change in developing countries has focused on its impact on natural systems, producing little insights on the present and future adaptability of whole systems. However, the effect of climate variability on innovation is a crucial factor in the calculus of understanding the adaptive potentials of social-ecological systems. The local and the global: multi-level institutional linkages and climate adaptation Globalization has increased the mobility of not only people, information and resources, but also new ideas and discourses that can facilitate innovation and adaptation. Local innovations and adaptations are thus increasingly interlinked with global policy and intervention indicative of a profound global interconnectedness between institutions and actors. Indeed, the global is embedded in the local and vice versa. The very notion of the local and the global constituting a dichotomy is, in fact, problematic because it is based on the idea of ""society as a bounded object or closed social system analogous to an organism,"" which it is not (beach. Meams. 82. Scoones, 1999: pp. 229-230). Rather. as Liep (2001: p. 169) explains: ""the modern or global is not something advancing at the boundary of the local but present and active in the midst of it. [...] Regarding creativity, we have thus seen that its viability is not only dependent on the resonance of a local social environment, but subject to the stark realities of a much wider context"". Individuals adapt and are innovative through complex interactions between institutions and actors at multiple scale levels. These processes are multi-directional and not - as would be proposed by a structuralist approach - only the result of larger scale institutions, such as those of donors and national government, providing a structure within which local actors must navigate. As Leach et al. (1999: p. 235) point out: ""the interrelationships between scale levels are far from deterministic. Land claims at the local level may spill over into national, state or provincial-level politics, for example, and influence the direction of future policy and the scope of legally enforceable rights"". Scale is a social construction, not a force of nature. Furthermore, institutions are dynamic (Agrawal, 2010: p. 174) and some institutions, as discussed by Yarrow, even alternate between global and local identities depending on the circumstances. Thus, in his study Yarrow (2008: p. 438) found that ""the opposition between local and global was employed relation- ally to make a variety of contextual distinctions and to perform a range of shifting identities"". Local and global understandings and practices of innovation and creativity in face of climate change are therefore entangled and cannot be analyzed as distinct. Research on the interrelationships between local and global processes shaping adaptation is still in its infancy. Although ""cross- scale linkages (crossing boundaries from local to global levels) are commonly asserted to be important in social processes"". Adger et al. (2005: p. 80) noted in 2005. ""in examining adaptation, the dynamic nature of linkages between levels of governance is not well-understood, and the politics of the construction of scale are often ignored"". Six years later, in 2011, the situation is only just beginning to change according to Pelling (2011: p. 163): ""Perhaps most important are the interactions between different levels of social actor (individuals and organizations) and of the institutions that give shape to social systems. Research and policy on adaptation to climate change is just beginning to recognize the full contribution of values and governance to behavior and action"". Recent work on the importance of the social aspects of climate change (see for example Meams 82 Norton, 2010; Pelling. 2011), has thus particlarly highlighted the interaction between institutions and actors across multiple levels (e.g., Agrawal, 2010: Ribot, 2010).",10000.0,"<h4>Warming inevitable, adaptation key—innovations spill over to international cooperation.</h4><p><strong>Olwig 11</p><p></strong>(Mette F., Department of Geology and Geography at the University of Copenhagen, Daivi Rodima-Taylor, African Studies Centre, Boston University, “Adaptation as innovation, innovation as adaptation: An institutional approach to climate change,” Applied Geography, 2011). </p><p><u><strong>While there is an increasing recognition that many adaptation actions are local and build off experience of managing past climatic risks</u></strong> (Christoplos et al.. 2009). <u><strong>There can be <mark>barriers </mark>and limitations <mark>to adaptation</u></strong></mark>.

Six years later, in 2011, the situation is only just beginning to change according to Pelling (2011: p. 163): ""<u><strong>Perhaps <mark>most important are the interactions between different levels of social actor</mark> (individuals and organizations) <mark>and of the institutions that give shape to social systems</u></strong></mark>. <u><strong>Research and policy on adaptation to climate change is just beginning to recognize the full contribution of values and governance to behavior and action</u></strong>"".

President Barack Obama’s administration says any Iran deal, which would likely involve easing extensive U.S. and international sanctions on Iran, would not be legally binding on the United States, and hence Congress should not have a role in approving it. But given the importance of the deal, says CFR’s John B. Bellinger III, “Republicans (and Democrats) in Congress are not out of line to insist on having some role in reviewing the agreement.” At the same time, he adds, “congressional Republicans should actually want the administration to immediately seek a binding Security Council resolution that would require international verification of Iran’s commitments under the agreement and impose additional international penalties for noncompliance.”¶ How does sanctions relief typically work in the United States?¶ Congress has imposed a complex and overlapping array of sanctions on Iran, including through new sanctions enacted during the last five years, that target Iran’s oil and gas, petrochemical, shipping, and financial sectors. In addition, President Obama has imposed additional sanctions on Iran through a series of executive orders issued pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.¶ Most of the congressional sanctions include waiver authority that permits the president to waive the different sanctions for a period of time if he determines that the waiver would be in the national interest or, in some cases, makes a more specific determination. Such waiver authority is typically included in congressionally mandated economic sanctions and gives a president flexibility to adjust sanctions as circumstances change. However, Congress must pass new legislation to remove the sanctions requirements altogether. In addition, some of the congressional sanctions may not be waived.¶ In contrast, the president may modify the sanctions imposed by executive order at any time, either by suspending them or eliminating them. Under the Joint Plan of Action with Iran adopted in November 2013, the president has suspended most of the sanctions he had previously imposed by executive order.¶ Is there any precedent for such a deal in which the president would rely on the Congress to play such a crucial role in lifting sanctions?¶ It’s not clear that President Obama is relying on Congress to lift sanctions at all. There is a bipartisan concern in Congress about the Iran deal, and many (if not most) Republicans appear to be opposed to lifting congressionally imposed sanctions. Thus, executive branch negotiators can promise only to lift or waive sanctions that the president has sole authority to control. At the same time, the administration must be cautious not to agree to any deal that would be so unpopular in Congress that a supermajority of Congress could pass additional sanctions on Iran over a presidential veto.¶ How is the U.S. policy process different (or more complicated) when the sanctions have an international dimension, like in the case of Iran, as opposed to when sanctions are unilateral, as in the case of Cuba?¶ The Iran talks are a multilateral negotiation, and U.S. negotiators must coordinate commitments they make to suspend or lift U.S. sanctions on Iran with the commitments made by the other so-called P5+1 countries. The UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on Iran in a series of six resolutions over the last nine years and the P5 countries, who are the five permanent members of the Council, have likely offered to support modification or lifting of these sanctions.¶ Germany, France, and the UK have likely promised to support modification of sanctions imposed by the European Union. U.S. negotiators have presumably committed to modify those sanctions that are within the power of the president to waive or suspend. U.S. negotiators must be careful not to commit—to Iran or the other P5+1 members—to take actions regarding sanctions relief that the executive branch will not be able to deliver, for either legal or political reasons.¶ Is the Congress trying to assert more of a role in this foreign policy process than it has in the past?¶ Congress has always been concerned about foreign policy commitments made by presidents. For instance, a bitterly divided, Republican-controlled Senate refused to approve the Treaty of Versailles that had been laboriously negotiated by Woodrow Wilson.¶ That said, the current controversy between Congress and the Obama Administration is unusual in several respects. First, it is certainly unusual for a large bloc of Congress (47 Republican Senators) to write directly to the leadership of another country (especially an adversary) in the midst of a sensitive negotiation being conducted by the president. Second, contrary to the apparent premise of the Republican letter, the Iran agreement would not be a treaty and does not require Senate approval. Moreover, according to the Obama Administration, it would not even be legally binding as a matter of international law (and therefore would not even have to be officially submitted to the Congress under the Case-Zablocki Act, which requires submission to Congress of legally binding international agreements that do not constitute treaties). In this respect, the Obama administration is correct that Congress traditionally has not had a role in reviewing and approving mere political declarations made by the executive branch (which are not legally binding under international law).¶ Nonetheless, the Iran deal is not a garden-variety political declaration. Even if it is not technically legally binding under international law (as a treaty or executive agreement), it obviously is an enormously important political undertaking by the executive branch and would be politically difficult for the current or a future president to reneg on; Republicans (and Democrats) in Congress are not out of line to insist in having some role in reviewing the agreement, even if formal Congressional “approval” is not required.¶ Some policymakers fear the Obama administration will circumvent the Congress and enshrine sanctions relief in a UN Security Council resolution. How would this affect the ability of future U.S. administrations to sanction Iran?¶ Senator Bob Corker (R-TN), the Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has written to President Obama to ask whether the administration is considering “going to the United Nations Security Council without coming to Congress first.” He added that this would be a “direct affront to the American people.”¶ In response, White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough confirmed in a letter to Senator Corker that the administration does plan to seek a Security Council resolution to affirm and/or implement any Iran agreement. He explained that: “We anticipate that the Security Council would pass a resolution to register its support for any deal and increase its international legitimacy. A resolution would also increase the international pressure on Iran to live up to the deal and would expand the risks if they failed to do so.” It’s not entirely clear what the Obama administration has in mind, but presumably the U.S. and other P5 members would seek a Security Council resolution adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, which authorizes the Security Council to make decisions that are binding on member states; a Chapter VII resolution would be necessary to lift or modify the sanctions imposed on Iran by prior Security Council resolutions adopted under Chapter VII and could also impose additional binding legal obligations on Iran to comply.¶ Despite their suspicions about both the Obama administration and the United Nations, congressional Republicans should actually want the administration to immediately seek a binding Security Council resolution that would require international verification of Iran’s commitments under the agreement and impose additional international penalties on Iran for noncompliance. The Security Council can impose internationally binding requirements on Iran that Congress by itself cannot.¶ Congressional Republicans presumably are concerned that the Obama Administration would instead try to circumvent the Congress by agreeing to a binding Security Council resolution that would place obligations on the United States, not on Iran (e.g., by requiring the United States to lift its domestic sanctions). However, it would be inconceivable to me that the Obama administration would seek a Security Council resolution that would impose binding legal obligations on the United States that would actually supersede or be contrary to U.S. statutory sanctions on Iran; this would also be contrary to Denis McDonough’s letter to Senator Corker.¶ In the event a deal is not reached, what action could the Congress take in regard to toughening sanctions against Iran?¶ Congress could pass additional sanctions on Iran and has threatened to do so. Several different bills have already been introduced to impose new sanctions on Iran (and one bill was passed by the House in 2013), and other members of Congress have indicated their desire to introduce additional bills. Of course, President Obama would have to sign any legislation passed by Congress for the legislation to become law, unless there are enough votes to override a presidential veto.¶ Senator Corker plans to hold hearings in mid-April on a bill that would require the president to submit the Iran deal to Congress for review and would prohibit the president from exercising his waiver authority to lift statutory sanctions for a period of two months while the congressional review is ongoing. The White House has said that President Obama would veto the Corker legislation.

S3-S8, January)
The question of resource scarcity has led to many debates on whether scarcity (whether of food or water) will lead to conflict and war. The underlining reasoning behind most of these discourses over food and water wars comes from the Malthusian belief that there is an imbalance between the economic availability of natural resources and population growth since while food production grows linearly, population increases exponentially. Following this reasoning, neo-Malthusians claim that finite natural resources place a strict limit on the growth of human population and aggregate consumption; if these limits are exceeded, social breakdown, conflict and wars result. Nonetheless, it seems that most empirical studies do not support any of these neo-Malthusian arguments. Technological change and greater inputs of capital have dramatically increased labour productivity in agriculture. More generally, the neo-Malthusian view has suffered because during the last two centuries humankind has breached many resource barriers that seemed unchallengeable. Lessons from history: alarmist scenarios, resource wars and international relations In a so-called age of uncertainty, a number of alarmist scenarios have linked the increasing use of water resources and food insecurity with wars. The idea of water wars (perhaps more than food wars) is a dominant discourse in the media (see for example Smith, 2009), NGOs (International Alert, 2007) and within international organizations (UNEP, 2007). In 2007, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon declared that ‘water scarcity threatens economic and social gains and is a potent fuel for wars and conflict’ (Lewis, 2007). Of course, this type of discourse has an instrumental purpose; security and conflict are here used for raising water/food as key policy priorities at the international level. In the Middle East, presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers have also used this bellicose rhetoric. Boutrous Boutros-Gali said; ‘the next war in the Middle East will be over water, not politics’ (Boutros Boutros-Gali in Butts, 1997, p. 65). The question is not whether the sharing of transboundary water sparks political tension and alarmist declaration, but rather to what extent water has been a principal factor in international conflicts. The evidence seems quite weak. Whether by president Sadat in Egypt or King Hussein in Jordan, none of these declarations have been followed up by military action. The governance of transboundary water has gained increased attention these last decades. This has a direct impact on the global food system as water allocation agreements determine the amount of water that can used for irrigated agriculture. The likelihood of conflicts over water is an important parameter to consider in assessing the stability, sustainability and resilience of global food systems. None of the various and extensive databases on the causes of war show water as a casus belli. Using the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data set and supplementary data from the University of Alabama on water conflicts, Hewitt, Wolf and Hammer found only seven disputes where water seems to have been at least a partial cause for conflict (Wolf, 1998, p. 251). In fact, about 80% of the incidents relating to water were limited purely to governmental rhetoric intended for the electorate (Otchet, 2001, p. 18). As shown in The Basins At Risk (BAR) water event database, more than two-thirds of over 1800 water-related ‘events’ fall on the ‘cooperative’ scale (Yoffe et al., 2003). Indeed, if one takes into account a much longer period, the following figures clearly demonstrate this argument. According to studies by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), organized political bodies signed between the year 805 and 1984 more than 3600 water-related treaties, and approximately 300 treaties dealing with water management or allocations in international basins have been negotiated since 1945 (FAO, 1978 and FAO, 1984). The fear around water wars have been driven by a Malthusian outlook which equates scarcity with violence, conflict and war. There is however no direct correlation between water scarcity and transboundary conflict. Most specialists now tend to agree that the major issue is not scarcity per se but rather the allocation of water resources between the different riparian states (see for example Allouche, 2005, Allouche, 2007 and [Rouyer, 2000] ). Water rich countries have been involved in a number of disputes with other relatively water rich countries (see for example India/Pakistan or Brazil/Argentina). The perception of each state’s estimated water needs really constitutes the core issue in transboundary water relations. Indeed, whether this scarcity exists or not in reality, perceptions of the amount of available water shapes people’s attitude towards the environment (Ohlsson, 1999). In fact, some water experts have argued that scarcity drives the process of co-operation among riparians (Dinar and Dinar, 2005 and Brochmann and Gleditsch, 2006). In terms of international relations, the threat of water wars due to increasing scarcity does not make much sense in the light of the recent historical record. Overall, the water war rationale expects conflict to occur over water, and appears to suggest that violence is a viable means of securing national water supplies, an argument which is highly contestable. The debates over the likely impacts of climate change have again popularised the idea of water wars. The argument runs that climate change will precipitate worsening ecological conditions contributing to resource scarcities, social breakdown, institutional failure, mass migrations and in turn cause greater political instability and conflict (Brauch, 2002 and Pervis and Busby, 2004). In a report for the US Department of Defense, Schwartz and Randall (2003) speculate about the consequences of a worst-case climate change scenario arguing that water shortages will lead to aggressive wars (Schwartz and Randall, 2003, p. 15). Despite growing concern that climate change will lead to instability and violent conflict, the evidence base to substantiate the connections is thin ( [Barnett and Adger, 2007] and Kevane and Gray, 2008).
No food wars – conflicts are more likely when resources are abundant
Salehyan 07 (Idean, assistant professor of political science at the University of North Texas, “The New myth about climate change,” August, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3922)
These claims generally boil down to an argument about resource scarcity. Desertification, sea-level rise, more-frequent severe weather events, an increased geographical range of tropical disease, and shortages of freshwater will lead to violence over scarce necessities. Friction between haves and have-nots will increase, and governments will be hard-pressed to provide even the most basic services. In some scenarios, mass migration will ensue, whether due to desertification, natural disasters, and rising sea levels, or as a consequence of resource wars. Environmental refugees will in turn spark political violence in receiving areas, and countries in the “global North” will erect ever higher barriers to keep culturally unwelcome—and hungry—foreigners out.  The number of failed states, meanwhile, will increase as governments collapse in the face of resource wars and weakened state capabilities, and transnational terrorists and criminal networks will move in. International wars over depleted water and energy supplies will also intensify. The basic need for survival will supplant nationalism, religion, or ideology as the fundamental root of conflict.  Dire scenarios like these may sound convincing, but they are misleading. Even worse, they are irresponsible, for they shift liability for wars and human rights abuses away from oppressive, corrupt governments. Additionally, focusing on climate change as a security threat that requires a military response diverts attention away from prudent adaptation mechanisms and new technologies that can prevent the worst catastrophes.  First, aside from a few anecdotes, there is little systematic empirical evidence that resource scarcity and changing environmental conditions lead to conflict. In fact, several studies have shown that an abundance of natural resources is more likely to contribute to conflict. Moreover, even as the planet has warmed, the number of civil wars
and insurgencies has decreased dramatically. Data collected by researchers at Uppsala University and the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo shows a steep decline in the number of armed conflicts around the world. Between 1989 and 2002, some 100 armed conflicts came to an end, including the wars in Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Cambodia. If global warming causes conflict, we should not be witnessing this downward trend.  Furthermore, if famine and drought led to the crisis in Darfur, why have scores of environmental catastrophes failed to set off armed conflict elsewhere? For instance, the U.N. World Food Programme warns that 5 million people in Malawi have been experiencing chronic food shortages for several years. But famine-wracked Malawi has yet to experience a major civil war. Similarly, the Asian tsunami in 2004 killed hundreds of thousands of people, generated millions of environmental refugees, and led to severe shortages of shelter, food, clean water, and electricity. Yet the tsunami, one of the most extreme catastrophes in recent history, did not lead to an outbreak of resource wars. Clearly then, there is much more to armed conflict than resource scarcity and natural disasters.",9908.0,"<h4>No extinction from ag collapse</h4><p><strong>Allouche 11</strong>, research Fellow – water supply and sanitation @ Institute for Development Studies, frmr professor – MIT, ‘11</p><p>(Jeremy, “The sustainability and resilience of global water and food systems: Political analysis of the interplay between security, resource scarcity, political systems and global trade,” Food Policy, Vol. 36 Supplement 1, p.

The underlining reasoning behind most of these discourses over food and water wars <u>comes from the Malthusian belief that there is an imbalance between</u> the economic availability of natural <u>resources and population growth</u> since while food production grows linearly, population increases exponentially. Following this reasoning, neo-Malthusians claim that finite natural resources place a strict limit on the growth of human population and aggregate consumption; if these limits are exceeded, social breakdown, conflict and wars result. Nonetheless, it seems that <u><strong>most <mark>empirical studies do not support</u></strong></mark> any of <u><strong><mark>these</u></strong></mark> neo-Malthusian <u><strong><mark>arguments</mark>.</u></strong> <u><mark>Tech</u></mark>nological change <u><mark>and</u></mark> greater inputs of <u><mark>capital have</mark> dramatically <mark>increased</u></mark> labour <u><mark>productivity</u></mark> in agriculture. More generally, <u>the neo-Malthusian view has suffered because</u> during the last two centuries <u><mark>humankind has breached</u></mark> many <u><mark>resource barriers that seemed unchallengeable.</mark> </u>Lessons from history: alarmist scenarios, resource wars and international relations In a so-called age of uncertainty, a number of <u><strong><mark>alarmist scenarios</u></strong></mark> have <u><mark>linked</u></mark> the increasing <u>use of <mark>water</mark> resources <mark>and food insecurity with wars.</u></mark> The idea of water wars (perhaps more than food wars) is a dominant discourse in the media (see for example Smith, 2009), NGOs (International Alert, 2007) and within international organizations (UNEP, 2007). In 2007, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon declared that ‘water scarcity threatens economic and social gains and is a potent fuel for wars and conflict’ (Lewis, 2007). Of course, this type of discourse has an instrumental purpose; security and conflict are here used for raising water/food as key policy priorities at the international level. <u><strong><mark>In the Mid</mark>dle <mark>East</u></strong></mark>, presidents, prime ministers and <u><mark>foreign ministers</mark> have</u> also <u><mark>used this</mark> bellicose <mark>rhetoric.</u></mark> Boutrous Boutros-Gali said; ‘the next war in the Middle East will be over water, not politics’ (Boutros Boutros-Gali in Butts, 1997, p. 65). The question is not whether the sharing of transboundary water sparks political tension and alarmist declaration, but rather to what extent water has been a principal factor in international conflicts. <u>The evidence seems quite weak.</u> Whether by president Sadat in Egypt or King Hussein in Jordan, <u>none of these declarations have been followed up by military action. </u>The governance of transboundary water has gained increased attention these last decades. This has a direct impact on the global food system as water allocation agreements determine the amount of water that can used for irrigated agriculture. The likelihood of conflicts over water is an important parameter to consider in assessing the stability, sustainability and resilience of global food systems. <u><mark>None of the <strong>various and extensive databases</strong> on</mark> the <mark>causes of war show water</mark> as a casus belli.</u> Using the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) data set and supplementary data from the University of Alabama on water conflicts, <u>Hewitt, Wolf and Hammer found only seven disputes where water seems to have been at least a partial cause</u> for conflict (Wolf, 1998, p. 251). In fact, about <u><mark>80% of</mark> the <mark>incidents</mark> relating to water <mark>were limited</u></mark> purely <u><mark>to</mark> governmental <mark>rhetoric</u></mark> intended for the electorate (Otchet, 2001, p. 18). As shown in The Basins At Risk (BAR) water event database, <u>more than <mark>two-thirds</mark> of</u> over <u>1800 water</u>-related ‘<u>events’ <mark>fall on the ‘cooperative’ scale</u></mark> (Yoffe et al., 2003). Indeed, if one takes into account a much longer period, the following figures clearly demonstrate this argument. According to studies by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), <u>organized political bodies signed</u> between the year 805 and 1984 <u>more than 3600 water-related treaties</u>, and approximately 300 treaties dealing with water management or allocations in international basins have been negotiated since 1945 (FAO, 1978 and FAO, 1984). The fear around water wars have been driven by a Malthusian outlook which equates scarcity with violence, conflict and war. <u><strong>There is</u></strong> however <u><strong>no</u></strong> direct <u><strong>correlation between water scarcity and transboundary conflict. </u></strong>Most specialists now tend to agree that the major issue is not scarcity per se but rather the allocation of water resources between the different riparian states (see for example Allouche, 2005, Allouche, 2007 and [Rouyer, 2000] ). <u>Water rich countries have been involved in</u> a number of <u>disputes with other</u> relatively <u>water rich countries</u> (see for example India/Pakistan or Brazil/Argentina). The perception of each state’s estimated water needs really constitutes the core issue in transboundary water relations. Indeed, whether this scarcity exists or not in reality, <u><mark>perceptions of</mark> the amount of available <mark>water</u></mark> shapes people’s attitude towards the environment (Ohlsson, 1999). In fact, some water experts have argued that scarcity <u><mark>drives</u></mark> the process of <u><mark>co-operation</mark> among riparians</u> (Dinar and Dinar, 2005 and Brochmann and Gleditsch, 2006). In terms of international relations, <u><strong>the <mark>threat of water wars</u></strong></mark> due to increasing scarcity <u><strong><mark>does not make</u></strong></mark> much <u><strong><mark>sense in the light of the</mark> recent <mark>historical record</mark>.</u></strong> Overall, the water war rationale expects conflict to occur over water, and appears to suggest that violence is a viable means of securing national water supplies, an argument which is highly contestable. The <u>debates over</u> the likely impacts of <u>climate change</u> have again <u>popularised</u> the idea of <u>water wars.</u> The argument runs that climate change will precipitate worsening ecological conditions contributing to resource scarcities, social breakdown, institutional failure, mass migrations and in turn cause greater political instability and conflict (Brauch, 2002 and Pervis and Busby, 2004). In a report for the US Department of Defense, Schwartz and Randall (2003) speculate about the consequences of a worst-case climate change scenario arguing that water shortages will lead to aggressive wars (Schwartz and Randall, 2003, p. 15). <u>Despite growing concern that climate change will lead to instability and violent conflict, the evidence base to substantiate the connections is thin</u> ( [Barnett and Adger, 2007] and Kevane<strong> and Gray, 2008).</p><p>No food wars – conflicts are more likely when resources are abundant</p><p>Salehyan</strong> <strong>07</strong> (Idean<u>, assistant professor of political science at the University of North Texas, “The New myth about climate change,” August, http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=3922)</p><p></u>These <u><mark>claims </u></mark>generally boil down to an argument <u><mark>about</mark> </u>resource <u><mark>scarcity</u></mark>. Desertification, sea-level rise, more-frequent severe weather events, an increased geographical range of tropical disease, and shortages of freshwater will lead to violence over scarce necessities. Friction between haves and have-nots will increase, and governments will be hard-pressed to provide even the most basic services. In some scenarios, mass migration will ensue, whether due to desertification, natural disasters, and rising sea levels, or as a consequence of resource wars. Environmental refugees will in turn spark political violence in receiving areas, and countries in the “global North” will erect ever higher barriers to keep culturally unwelcome—and hungry—foreigners out.  The number of failed states, meanwhile, will increase as governments collapse in the face of resource wars and weakened state capabilities, and transnational terrorists and criminal networks will move in. International wars over depleted water and energy supplies will also intensify. The basic need for survival will supplant nationalism, religion, or ideology as the fundamental root of conflict.  Dire scenarios like these may sound convincing, but they <u><mark>are misleading</u></mark>. Even worse, they are irresponsible, for they shift liability for wars and human rights abuses away from oppressive, corrupt governments. Additionally, focusing on climate change as a security threat that requires a military response diverts attention away from prudent adaptation mechanisms and new technologies that can prevent the worst catastrophes.  First, aside from a few anecdotes, <u><mark>there is little </u></mark>systematic empirical <u><mark>evidence that </u></mark>resource <u><mark>scarcity </u></mark>and changing environmental conditions <u><mark>lead to conflict</u></mark>. In fact, several <u><mark>studies have shown that </u></mark>an <u><mark>abundance </u></mark>of natural resources <u><mark>is more likely to contribute to conflict</u></mark>. Moreover, <u><mark>even as the planet has warmed, the number of civil wars </p><p></u></mark>and insurgencies has decreased dramatically. Data collected by researchers at Uppsala University and the International Peace Research Institute, Oslo shows a steep decline in the number of armed conflicts around the world. Between 1989 and 2002, some 100 armed conflicts came to an end, including the wars in Mozambique, Nicaragua, and Cambodia. If global warming causes conflict, we should not be witnessing this downward trend.  Furthermore, if famine and drought led to the crisis in Darfur, why have scores of environmental catastrophes failed to set off armed conflict elsewhere? For instance, the U.N. World Food Programme warns that <u><mark>5 million people in Malawi have been experiencing </u></mark>chronic <u><mark>food shortages </u></mark>for several years. <u><mark>But </u></mark>famine-wracked <u><mark>Malawi has yet to experience a </u></mark>major civil <u><mark>war</u></mark>. Similarly, the Asian tsunami in 2004 killed hundreds of thousands of people, generated millions of environmental refugees, and led to severe shortages of shelter, food, clean water, and electricity. Yet the tsunami, one of the most extreme catastrophes in recent history, did not lead to an outbreak of resource wars. Clearly then, <u><mark>there is much more to armed conflict than resource scarcity </u></mark>and natural disasters.  </p>",1NR,Adv 3,2NC Youths,28932,766,19134,./documents/ndtceda14/UNLV/GoVe/UNLV-Gomez-Velto-Neg-Umkcbabyjo-Round3.docx,570504,N,Umkcbabyjo,3,Kansas Foreman-Goh,Morris,"Aff = Marijuana

Ressentiment can be cultivated via the assignment of blame to political enemies while simultaneous speaking of a politics of reconciliation, bipartisanship, and aisle-crossing. Ronald Reagan coupled an insouciant optimism and personal charm with deft demonization of evil empires, welfare queens, and their fellow travelers. Left politicians misunderstand the Rightist criticism of “flip-flopping” because they take the critic to literally mean what he or she says. The Rightists do not mean this, and they know it. The flip-flopping of one’s political allies is as meaningless as the flip- flopping of one’s foes is evidence of hypocrisy, weakness, indecisiveness, etc. Thus one sees plenty of politicians who play to opposite registers (resentment now, reconciliation later) and who are not punished; the ones who are, like John Kerry, are punished not for 25 flip-flopping but for being too dull-witted to understand the nature of the game they are playing. Ressentiment should be cultivated at the most general level possible, though without ruling out the use of specifics: Personalized narratives of woe are crucial to the refinement of ressentiment, but this should not be taken as license to “go specific” at all costs. In particular, examples of particular people should be used carefully, as the most important element of the exemplar is that a general audience be able to their own story mirrored in the spectacle of misery being displayed before them. While there are numerous possible foci for such a generalized ressentiment, the corporation and the government agencies beholden to corporate capitalism still seems the most likely and most fruitful targets of opportunity. It is crucial, however, to maintain the rhetoric of equality of opportunity and the defense of the small businessman amidst the critique of the corporation. If this seems like an impossible feat, consider that it is no more inherently difficult than Reagan’s rhetorical evisceration of “Big Government” while simultaneously creating the creating the largest American federal government in history. Of course there was a contradiction at the heart of his program – but does identifying this as a debating point have any real effect? Ressentiment is inevitable as long as consumer capitalism holds sway, according to the theorists most prized by the Left, so we had better make our peace with her: This is not to reify ressentiment, as I have stated before, but it is to say that the Left more so than the Right has reason to utilize ressentiment with a good conscience. It is from the Left that 26 we hear the narrative of capitalism as a ressentiment-producing engine of amazing power (Connolly 1988; Brown 1993), and unless capitalism is about to pass from the scene, which seems wishful thinking of the most extreme nature, the Left should be harnessing the energy of this current rather than simply criticizing it. There are many filaments that comprise the fiber of the American Left, but whether indebted to the theories of Marx, Nietzsche, or Rawls, most of these strands implicitly link their political programs to the ressentiment-producing apparatuses of contemporary society. Indeed, Wendy Brown implies that ressentiment is responsible for “welfare-state liberalism” as such in the form of “attenuations of the unmitigated license of the rich and powerful on behalf of the ‘disadvantaged’” (Brown 1993, 400). Perhaps I am being unfair here to Brown, but it sounds as if the welfare state is a rather tawdry achievement. While I have no interest in further propping up the status quo, it seems worth noting that ressentiment’s acknowledged role in the creation of liberal democracy, here scoffed at by Brown, is no small thing. Ressentiment is patient, but not infinitely so. If, as Melissa Lane observes in her study of Plato’s Statesman, a sense of timing is the sine qua non of the political ruler (Lane 1998), then we must be sensitive to the kairos, the right moment for the deployment of a ressentiment-filled rhetoric. It would be difficult to imagine a more opportune moment than the present recession for cultivating a sense of working-class victimage, yet, oddly enough, it is the Right rather than the Left which has been carrying the banner of anti- finance capital. How is this possible? When one is the party in power in the United States it is difficult to govern without the consent of the barons of Wall Street, and the 27 Democrats must be particularly solicitous of the favor of the financial elites since a collapsing Dow Jones, ever skittish of “statist” Democratic interference, is prone to regard even the mildest brand of Democratic populism as the equivalent of the October Revolution. Democratic elites have felt it necessary to go the extra mile around a horse as shy as this one, and coupled with the particular friendships and connections between Obama and his economic advisors, who read like a who’s who of Goldman Sachs alums, and it is easy to understand why it is Glenn Beck rather than Barack Obama who has taken up the populist mantle. That said, opportunities like this do not come along often, and pivotal electoral moments can reshape the political landscape for decades. The crucial question to ask is how the needs of the resentful many can be squared with the need to placate corporate power (i.e. to prevent stock markets from crashing, capital fleeing overseas, international economic sanctions, etc.). Populists from South America to Europe have found multiple answers to this question, so the dilemma is not an insoluble one. But in order to address this tension the Left must first give up its utopian hope that the Beloved Community is around the corner, and that all that is needed to get there is one final psychological purge. The resentful are going to be here for a long time to come, as Brown and Connolly ably demonstrate, so Obama, Pelosi, Reid, and their successors must begin to think more creatively about how to combine the politics of hope with the politics of blame. After Ressentiment In closing I would suggest that my praise of ressentiment is also in line with the more deliberatively conceived multiculturalism of the Left than is the current puritanical disdain. As Monique Deveaux argues, it is a failure of political imagination when we 28 fixate on liberal principles as preconditions to multicultural dialogue, and in particular it is necessary to move toward a deeper level of intercultural respect rather than mere toleration (Deveaux 2000).10 But if it is appropriate to go beyond simply tolerating non- liberal peoples abroad and in immigrant communities, if we must go beyond toleration to do justice to the rich tradition of cultural pluralism, then perhaps we can also open our hearts and minds to the possibility that the ressentiment-suffused need to be heard out as well. Perhaps rather than demonizing ressentiment as a toxin to politics, as the worst of the worst for subjects whom we purport to free, we must accept that ressentiment is for many inseparable from their conception of their own freedom. Perhaps rather than pitying these poor fools, in ways that we would never pity a plural wife in the global South, we should ponder whether ressentiment as a precondition of subjectivity is as much a gift as a curse. And are we so sure, after all, we late Nietzscheans, that our crusade against ressentiment is not itself suffused with ressentiment? Is not itself fully in the grips of it? How would we know if it were or weren’t? Perhaps we are, in our own way, as spiteful, vain, petty, weak, subjected, enraged against the past, capitalized, consumerized, unfree, as those we purport to want to free from the chains of slave morality. Perhaps it is ourselves that we need to give a break to, that we need to get over, when we first look to purge the other of ressentiment. Perhaps we all swim in this current, perhaps we are all Ressentiment’s children, and perhaps that is OK – even to the extreme of the using ressentiment unconsciously in the effort to rid the world of ressentiment. Though just in saying so I wouldn’t expect that to do much to overturn Ressentiment’s reign. No, she is far too puissant for that. But we do not need to rage against the weakness in others because we fear the dependence and weakness in ourselves. As Vetlesen puts it, defending Amery: “Against Nietzsche, who despised victims because he saw them as weak, as losers in life’s struggles, Amery upholds the dignity of having been forced by circumstances beyond one’s control into that position, thus reminding Nietzsche that as humans we are essentially relational beings, dependent, not self-sufficient. In hailing the strong and despising the weak, in denying that vulnerability is a basic ineluctably given human condition, a condition from which not only the role of victim springs but that of the morally responsible agent too, Nietzsche fails to be the provocateur he loves to believe he is: He sides with the complacent majority and so helps reinforce the existential and moral loneliness felt by Amery, the individual victim who speaks up precisely in that capacity” (Vetlesen 2006, 43). Perhaps we can begin to see how we have been using the weak, the viewers of Glenn Beck and others, as the targets for our need to find blameworthy agents. And that too is fine. The trouble comes when we think we’ve gone beyond Ressentiment when in fact we’re just listening to her whisperings without realizing it. We think that we can well and truly look down on the Rush Limbaughs, these destroyers of civilization, because they are possessed by something that we are above. And far be it from me to suggest that we should not resent, should not blame; I merely suggest we direct our blame toward more useful ends than where it is currently located.",9936.0,"<h4>Ressentiment is an inevitable aspect of life---we should stop trying to repress it and instead use it to consciously motivate politics---the alt produces true self-hatred </h4><p><u><strong>Dolgert 10</u></strong> Stefan, Prof @ Brock U, In Praise of Ressentiment<u><strong>: OR, How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Glen Beck, APSA 2010 Annual Meeting Paper, http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1642232 </p><p></u></strong>Ressentiment is not jealous: <u><strong>It is not necessary to maintain consistency of political message across time and context.

As Monique Deveaux argues, it is a failure of political imagination when we 28 fixate on liberal principles as preconditions to multicultural dialogue, and in particular it is necessary to move toward a deeper level of intercultural respect rather than mere toleration (Deveaux 2000).10 But if it is appropriate to go beyond simply tolerating non- liberal peoples abroad and in immigrant communities, if we must go beyond toleration to do justice to the rich tradition of cultural pluralism, then perhaps we can also open our hearts and minds to the possibility that the ressentiment-suffused need to be heard out as well.<u><strong> Perhaps <mark>rather than demonizing ressentiment</mark> as a toxin to politics, as the worst of the worst for subjects whom we purport to free, <mark>we must accept that ressentiment is for many inseparable from</mark> their conception of their own <mark>freedom</u></strong></mark>. Perhaps <u><strong>rather than pitying these poor fools, in ways that we would never pity a plural wife in the global South, we should ponder whether <mark>ressentiment as a precondition of subjectivity is as much</mark> a <mark>gift as</mark> a <mark>curse</mark>.</u></strong> And are we so sure, after all, we late Nietzscheans, that our crusade against ressentiment is not itself suffused with ressentiment? Is not itself fully in the grips of it? How would we know if it were or weren’t? <u><strong>Perhaps we are, in our own way, as spiteful, vain, petty, weak, subjected, enraged against the past, capitalized, consumerized, unfree, as those we purport to want to free from the chains of slave morality. Perhaps it is ourselves that we need to give a break to, that we need to get over, when we first look to purge the other of ressentiment. Perhaps we all swim in this current, <mark>perhaps we are all Ressentiment’s children, and perhaps that is OK – even to the extreme of</mark> the <mark>using ressentiment</mark> unconsciously in the effort <mark>to rid the world of ressentiment</u></strong></mark>. Though just in saying so I wouldn’t expect that to do much to overturn Ressentiment’s reign. No, she is far too puissant for that. But <u><strong>we do not need to rage against the weakness in others because we fear the dependence and weakness in ourselves</u></strong>. As Vetlesen puts it, defending Amery: “<u><strong><mark>Against Nietzsche</mark>, who despised victims because he saw them as weak, as losers in life’s struggles, Amery upholds the dignity of having been forced by circumstances beyond one’s control into that position, thus reminding Nietzsche that <mark>as humans we are</mark> essentially <mark>relational beings</mark>, dependent, <mark>not self-sufficient</mark>. In hailing the strong and despising the weak, <mark>in denying that vulnerability is</mark> a basic ineluctably given <mark>human</mark> condition, a condition from which not only the role of victim springs but that of the morally responsible agent too, <mark>Nietzsche</mark> fails to be the provocateur he loves to believe he is: He <mark>sides with the complacent majority and so helps reinforce</u></strong></mark> the <u><strong><mark>existential and moral loneliness</u></strong></mark> felt by Amery, the individual victim who speaks up precisely in that capacity” (Vetlesen 2006, 43). Perhaps we can begin to see how <u><strong>we have been using the weak</u></strong>, the viewers of Glenn Beck and others, <u><strong>as the targets for our need to find blameworthy agents. And that too is fine. <mark>The trouble comes when we think we’ve gone beyond Ressentiment when in fact we’re just listening to her</mark> whisperings <mark>without realizing it</mark>.</u></strong> We think that we can well and truly look down on the Rush Limbaughs, these destroyers of civilization, because they are possessed by something that we are above. And <u><strong>far be it from me to suggest that we should not resent, should not blame; I merely suggest we direct our blame toward more useful ends than where it is currently located.</p></u></strong>",Round 5,1NC,Case,34432,116,19171,./documents/ndtceda14/USC/SaVi/USC-Saiedian-Vitzileos-Neg-Fullerton-Round5.docx,570607,N,Fullerton,5,Harvard Bolman-Suo,Thiele,Framework,ndtceda14/USC/SaVi/USC-Saiedian-Vitzileos-Neg-Fullerton-Round5.docx,,48861,SaVi,USC SaVi,,Id.....,Sa.....,Jo.....,Vi.....,18821,USC,USC,,,1004,ndtceda14,NDT/CEDA 2014-15,2014,cx,college,2

In stating this, we need to include an important caveat that differentiates our approach from those invoking the well-worn race/class/gender triplet which can sound, to the uninitiated, both radical and vaguely Marxian. It is not. Race, class and gender, while they invariably intersect and interact, are not co-primary. This ‘triplet’ approximates what the ‘philosophers might call a category mistake.’ On the surface the triplet may be convincing—some people are oppressed because of their race, others as a result of their gender, yet others because of their class—but this ‘is grossly misleading’ for it is not that ‘some individuals manifest certain characteristics known as “class” which then results in their oppression; on the contrary, to be a member of a social class just is to be oppressed’ and in this regard class is ‘a wholly social category’ (Eagleton, 1998, p. 289). Furthermore, even though ‘class’ is usually invoked as part of the aforementioned and much vaunted triptych, it is usually gutted of its practical, social dimension or treated solely as a cultural phenomenon—as just another form of ‘difference.’ In these instances, class is transformed from an economic and, indeed, social category to an exclusively cultural or discursive one or one in which class merely signifies a ‘subject position.’ Class is therefore cut off from the political economy of capitalism and class power severed from exploitation and a power structure ‘in which those who control collectively produced resources only do so because of the value generated by those who do not’ (Hennessy & Ingraham, 1997, p. 2).¶ Such theorizing has had the effect of replacing an historical materialist class analysis with a cultural analysis of class. As a result, many post-Marxists have also stripped the idea of class of precisely that element which, for Marx, made it radical—namely its status as a universal form of exploitation whose abolition required (and was also central to) the abolition of all manifestations of oppression (Marx, 1978, p. 60). With regard to this issue, Kovel (2002) is particularly insightful, for he explicitly addresses an issue which continues to vex the Left—namely the priority given to different categories of what he calls ‘dominative splitting’—those categories of ‘gender, class, race, ethnic and national exclusion,’ etc. Kovel argues that we need to ask the question of priority with respect to what? He notes that if we mean priority with respect to time, then the category of gender would have priority since there are traces of gender oppression in all other forms of oppression. If we were to prioritize in terms of existential significance, Kovel suggests that we would have to depend upon the immediate historical forces that bear down on distinct groups of people—he offers examples of Jews in 1930s Germany who suffered from brutal forms of anti-Semitism and Palestinians today who experience anti-Arab racism under Israeli domination. The question of what has political priority, however, would depend upon which transformation of relations of oppression are practically more urgent and, while this would certainly depend upon the preceding categories, it would also depend upon the fashion in which all the forces acting in a concrete situation are deployed. As to the question of which split sets into motion all of the others, the priority would have to be given to class since class relations¶ entail the state as an instrument of enforcement and control, and it is the state that shapes and organizes the splits that appear in human ecosystems. Thus class is both logically and historically distinct from other forms of exclusion (hence we should not talk of ‘classism’ to go along with ‘sexism’ and ‘racism,’ and ‘species-ism’). This is, first of all, because class is an essentially man-made category, without root in even a mystified biology. We cannot imagine a human world without gender distinctions—although we can imagine a world without domination by gender. But a world without class is eminently imaginable—indeed, such was the human world for the great majority of our species’ time on earth, during all of which considerable fuss was made over gender. Historically, the difference arises because ‘class’ signifies one side of a larger figure that includes a state apparatus whose conquests and regulations create races and shape gender relations. Thus there will be no true resolution of racism so long as class society stands, inasmuch as a racially oppressed society implies the activities of a class-defending state. Nor can gender inequality be enacted away so long as class society, with its state, demands the super-exploitation of women’s labor. (Kovel, 2002, pp. 123–124)¶ Contrary to what many have claimed, Marxist theory does not relegate categories of ‘difference’ to the conceptual mausoleum; rather, it has sought to reanimate these categories by interrogating how they are refracted through material relations of power and privilege and linked to relations of production. Moreover, it has¶ emphasized and insisted that the wider political and economic system in which they are embedded needs to be thoroughly understood in all its complexity. Indeed, Marx made clear how constructions of race and ethnicity ‘are implicated in the circulation process of variable capital.’ To the extent that ‘gender, race, and ethnicity are all understood as social constructions rather than as essentialist categories’ the effect of exploring their insertion into the ‘circulation of variable capital (including positioning within the internal heterogeneity of collective labor and hence, within the division of labor and the class system)’ must be interpreted as a ‘powerful force reconstructing them in distinctly capitalist ways’ (Harvey, 2000, p. 106). Unlike contemporary narratives which tend to focus on one or another form of oppression, the irrefragable power of historical materialism resides in its ability to reveal (1) how forms of oppression based on categories of difference do not possess relative autonomy from class relations but rather constitute the ways in which oppression is lived/experienced within a class-based system; and (2) how all forms of social oppression function within an overarching capitalist system.¶ This framework must be further distinguished from those that invoke the terms ‘classism’ and/or ‘class elitism’ to (ostensibly) foreground the idea that ‘class matters’ (cf. hooks, 2000) since we agree with Gimenez (2001, p. 24) that ‘class is not simply another ideology legitimating oppression.’ Rather, class denotes ‘exploitative relations between people mediated by their relations to the means of production.’ To marginalize such a conceptualization of class is to conflate an individual’s objective location in the intersection of structures of inequality with people’s subjective understandings of who they really are based on their ‘experiences.’¶ Another caveat. In making such a claim, we are not renouncing the concept of experience. On the contrary, we believe it is imperative to retain the category of lived experience as a reference point in light of misguided post-Marxist critiques which imply that all forms of Marxian class analysis are dismissive of subjectivity. We are not, however, advocating the uncritical fetishization of ‘experience’ that tends to assume that experience somehow guarantees the authenticity of knowledge and which often treats experience as self-explanatory, transparent, and solely individual. Rather, we advance a framework that seeks to make connections between seemingly isolated situations and/or particular experiences by exploring how they are constituted in, and circumscribed by, broader historical and social circum- stances. Experiential understandings, in and of themselves, are suspect because, dialectically, they constitute a unity of opposites—they are at once unique, specific, and personal, but also thoroughly partial, social, and the products of historical forces about which individuals may know little or nothing (Gimenez, 2001). In this sense, a rich description of immediate experience in terms of consciousness of a particular form of oppression (racial or otherwise) can be an appropriate and indispensable point of departure. Such an understanding, however, can easily become an isolated ‘difference’ prison unless it transcends the immediate perceived point of oppression, confronts the social system in which it is rooted, and expands into a complex and multifaceted analysis (of forms of social mediation) that is capable of mapping out the general organization of social relations. That, however, requires a broad class-based approach.¶ © 2004 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia¶ Class Dismissed? 189¶ 190¶ Valerie Scatamburlo-D’Annibale & Peter McLaren¶ Having a concept of class helps us to see the network of social relations constituting an overall social organization which both implicates and cuts through racialization/ethnicization and gender ...

Brown (1995) positions herself within thedebate about identity politics by seeking to elaborate on “the wounded character of politicised identity’s desire” (ibid: 55); thatis, the problem of “wounded attachments” whereby a claim to identity becomes over-invested in its own historical suffering and perpetuates its injury through its refusal to give up its identity claim. Brown’s argument is that where politicised identity is founded upon an experience of exclusion, for example, exclusion itself becomes perversely valorised in the continuance of that identity. In such cases, group activity operates to maintain and reproduce the identity created by injury (exclusion) rather than– and indeed, often in opposition to – resolving the injurious social relations that generated claims around that identity in the ﬁrst place. If things have to have a history in order to have af uture, then the problem becomes that of how history is con-structed in order to make the future. To the extent that, for Brown, identity is associated primarily with (historical) injury, the future for that identity is then already determined by the injury “as both bound to the history that produced it and as a reproach to the present which embodies that history” (ibid 1995: 73). Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. Politicised identity, Brown maintains, “emerges and obtains its unifying coherence through the politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal, as a protest against exclusion” (ibid: 65). Its continuing existence requires both a belief in the legitimacy of the universal ideal (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) and enduring exclusion from those ideals. Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that such identi-ties, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment andinequality, then become invested in their own impotence through practices of, for example, reproach, complaint, and revenge. These are “reactions” in the Nietzschean sense since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. Rather than acting to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering is instead ameliorated (to some extent) through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue” (ibid 1995:70), and is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimi-nation. Such practices, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, provide obstacles to – practices that would seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion. Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past. This is because for those who have suffered oppression and exclusion, the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible to meet. We would argue instead that the “turn to the future” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient, who is doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget and to forget in order to be able to live in the present. 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past. Indeed, this wouldseem to be similar to the message of Beloved , whose central motif of haunting (is the adult woman, “Beloved”, Sethe’s murderedchild returned in spectral form?) dramatises the tendency of theunanalysed traumatic past to keep on returning, constraining, asit does so, the present to be like the past, and thereby, disallow-ing the possibility of a future different from that past. As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “in order to break the seal of the past, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, we must ﬁrst bring them into the realm of political action” (2004: 33). We would add that the task of analys-ing the traumatic past, and thus opening up the possibility of political action, is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but that this, instead, requires a “community” of participants dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. The “pain” of historical injury is not simply an individual psychological issue, but stems from objective social conditions which perpetuate, for the most part, forms of injustice and inequality into the present. In sum, Brown presents too stark a choice between past andfuture. In the example of Beloved with which we began thisarticle, Paul D’s acceptance of Sethe’s experiences of slavery asdistinct from his own, enable them both to arrive at new under-standings of their experience. Such understanding is a way of partially “undoing” the (effects of) the past and coming to terms with the locatedness of one’s being in the world (Mohanty 1995). As this example shows, opening up a future, and attending to theongoing effects of a traumatic past, are only incorrectly under-stood as alternatives. A second set of problems with Brown’s critique of identity poli-tics emerge from what we regard as her tendency to individualise social problems as problems that are the possession and theresponsibility of the “wounded” group. Brown suggests that the problems associated with identity politics can be overcome through a “shift in the character of political expression and politi-cal claims common to much politicised identity” (1995: 75). She deﬁnes this shift as one in which identity would be expressed in terms of desire rather than of ontology by supplanting the lan-guage of “I am” with the language of “I want this for us” (1995:75). Such a reconﬁguration, she argues, would create an opportu-nity to “rehabilitate the memory of desire within identiﬁcatory processes…prior to [their] wounding” (1995: 75). It would fur-ther refocus attention on the future possibilities present in theidentity as opposed to the identity being foreclosed through its attention to past-based grievances.",10030.0,"<h4>The aff’s narrative is grounded in injuries of the past with no guide for the future---this reinscribes exclusion and foreclosures social justice </h4><p><strong>Bhambra 10</strong>—U Warwick—AND—Victoria Margree—School of Humanities, U Brighton (Identity Politics and the Need for a ‘Tomorrow’, http://www.academia.edu/471824/Identity_Politics_and_the_Need_for_a_Tomorrow_)</p><p>2 The Reification of Identity We wish to turn now to a related problem within identity politicsthat can be best described as the problem of <u><strong><mark>the reiﬁcation of politicised identities</u></strong></mark>.

Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past. This is because for those who have suffered oppression and exclusion, the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible to meet. We would argue instead that the “turn to the future” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient, who is doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget and to forget in order to be able to live in the present. 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past. Indeed, this wouldseem to be similar to the message of Beloved , whose central motif of haunting (is the adult woman, “Beloved”, Sethe’s murderedchild returned in spectral form?) dramatises the tendency of theunanalysed traumatic past to keep on returning, constraining, asit does so, the present to be like the past, and thereby, disallow-ing the possibility of a future different from that past. As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “in order to break the seal of the past, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, we must ﬁrst bring them into the realm of political action” (2004: 33). We would add that the task of analys-ing the traumatic past, and thus opening up the possibility of political action, is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but that this, instead, requires a “community” of participants dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. The “pain” of historical injury is not simply an individual psychological issue, but stems from objective social conditions which perpetuate, for the most part, forms of injustice and inequality into the present. In sum, Brown presents too stark a choice between past andfuture. In the example of Beloved with which we began thisarticle, Paul D’s acceptance of Sethe’s experiences of slavery asdistinct from his own, enable them both to arrive at new under-standings of their experience. Such understanding is a way of partially “undoing” the (effects of) the past and coming to terms with the locatedness of one’s being in the world (Mohanty 1995). As this example shows, opening up a future, and attending to theongoing effects of a traumatic past, are only incorrectly under-stood as alternatives. A second set of problems with Brown’s critique of identity poli-tics emerge from what we regard as her tendency to individualise social problems as problems that are the possession and theresponsibility of the “wounded” group. Brown suggests that the problems associated with identity politics can be overcome through a “shift in the character of political expression and politi-cal claims common to much politicised identity” (1995: 75). She deﬁnes this shift as one in which identity would be expressed in terms of desire rather than of ontology by supplanting the lan-guage of “I am” with the language of “I want this for us” (1995:75). Such a reconﬁguration, she argues, would create an opportu-nity to “rehabilitate the memory of desire within identiﬁcatory processes…prior to [their] wounding” (1995: 75). It would fur-ther refocus attention on the future possibilities present in theidentity as opposed to the identity being foreclosed through its attention to past-based grievances.",10028.0,"<h4>The politics of identity is reactionary which ultimately creates an attachment to the status of oppression---the affirmative’s emphasis on exclusion from Whiteness perversely recreate those as valorized ideals </h4><p><strong>Bhambra 10</strong>—U Warwick—AND—Victoria Margree—School of Humanities, U Brighton (Identity Politics and the Need for a ‘Tomorrow’, http://www.academia.edu/471824/Identity_Politics_and_the_Need_for_a_Tomorrow_)</p><p>2 The Reification of Identity We wish to turn now to a related problem within identity politicsthat can be best described as the problem of <u><strong>the reiﬁcation of politicised identities</u></strong>.

Brown (1995) positions herself within thedebate about identity politics by seeking to elaborate on “the wounded character of politicised identity’s desire” (ibid: 55); thatis, the problem of “wounded attachments” whereby a claim to identity becomes over-invested in its own historical suffering and perpetuates its injury through its refusal to give up its identity claim. Brown’s argument is that where politicised identity is founded upon an experience of exclusion, for example, exclusion itself becomes perversely valorised in the continuance of that identity. In such cases, group activity operates to maintain and reproduce the identity created by injury (exclusion) rather than– and indeed, often in opposition to – resolving the injurious social relations that generated claims around that identity in the ﬁrst place. If things have to have a history in order to have af uture, then the problem becomes that of how history is con-structed in order to make the future. To the extent that, for Brown, identity is associated primarily with (historical) injury, the future for that identity is then already determined by the injury “as both bound to the history that produced it and as a reproach to the present which embodies that history” (ibid 1995: 73). Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. Politicised identity, Brown maintains, “emerges and obtains its unifying coherence through the politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal, as a protest against exclusion” (ibid: 65). Its continuing existence requires both a belief in the legitimacy of the universal ideal (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) and enduring exclusion from those ideals. Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that such identi-ties, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment andinequality, then become invested in their own impotence through practices of, for example, reproach, complaint, and revenge. These are “reactions” in the Nietzschean sense since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. Rather than acting to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering is instead ameliorated (to some extent) through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue” (ibid 1995:70), and is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimnation. Such practices, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, provide obstacles to – practices that would seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion. Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures.

Brown (1995) positions herself within thedebate about identity politics by seeking to <u><strong>elaborate on</u></strong> “<u><strong>the wounded character of</u></strong> <u><strong>politicised identity’s desire</u></strong>” (ibid: 55); thatis, <u>the problem of “<mark>wounded attachments</mark>” whereby a claim to identity <mark>becomes <strong>over-invested</mark> <mark>in its own </mark>historical <mark>suffering</u></strong> <u>and <strong>perpetuates its injury</strong> </mark>through its refusal to give up its identity claim.</u> Brown’s argument is that <u><mark>where</mark> politicised <mark>identity is founded upon</mark> an <mark>experience of exclusion</u></mark>, for example, <u><strong><mark>exclusion</mark> itself <mark>becomes perversely valorised in the continuance of that identity</u></strong>.</mark> In such cases, <u><mark>group activity operates to</mark> maintain and <mark>reproduce the identity created by injury</mark> (exclusion) </u>rather than– and indeed, often <u><strong><mark>in opposition to – resolving the </mark>injurious <mark>social relations that generated</mark> claims around <mark>that identity</mark> <mark>in the ﬁrst place.</u></strong></mark> If things have to have a history in order to have af uture, then the problem becomes that of how history is con-structed in order to make the future. <u><mark>To the extent that</u>,</mark> for Brown, <u><mark>identity is associated</mark> </u>primarily<u> <mark>with (historical) injury, the</mark> <mark>future</mark> for that identity <mark>is</mark> then <strong><mark>already determined by the injury</strong></mark> “as </u>both<u> bound to the history that produced it </u>and as a reproach to the present which embodies that history” (ibid 1995: 73). Brown’s sug-gestion that as it is not possible to undo the past, the focus back- wards entraps the identity in reactionary practices, is, we believe,too stark and we will pursue this later in the article. <u>Politicised identity</u>, Brown maintains, “emerges and <u>obtains its unifying coherence through the <strong>politicisation of exclusion from an ostensible universal</strong>, as a protest against exclusion</u>” (ibid: 65). <u><mark>Its</mark> continuing <mark>existence requires</mark> both a belief in <mark>the legitimacy of the</mark> <mark>universal ideal</u></mark> (for example, ideals of opportunity, and re- ward in proportion to effort) <u><mark>and</mark> enduring <mark>exclusion from those ideals</mark>.</u> Brown draws upon Nietzsche in arguing that <u><strong><mark>such identi-ties</mark>, produced in reaction to conditions of disempowerment </u></strong>andinequality, then <u><strong><mark>become invested in their</mark> own <mark>impotence through</mark> practices of</u></strong>, for example, reproach, complaint, and <u><strong><mark>revenge</u></strong></mark>. <u>These are “reactions</u>” in the Nietzschean sense <u>since they are substitutes for actions or can be seen as negative forms of action. <strong><mark>Rather than acting</mark> <mark>to remove the cause(s) of suffering, that suf-fering</mark> is instead ameliorated</u></strong> (to some extent) <u><strong>through “the estab-lishment of suffering as the measure of social virtue</u></strong>” (ibid 1995:70), <u><strong>and <mark>is compensated for by the vengeful pleasures of recrimnation</u></strong>. <u><strong>Such</u></strong> <u><strong>practices</u></strong></mark>, she argues, stand in sharp distinction to –in fact, <u><strong><mark>provide obstacles to</u></strong></mark> – <u><strong><mark>practices that </u></strong></mark>would<u><strong> <mark>seek to dispel the conditions of exclusion.</mark> </u></strong>Brown casts the dilemma discussed above in terms of a choicebetween past and future, and adapting Nietzsche, exhorts theadoption of a (collective) will that would become the “redeemer of history” (ibid: 72) through its focus on the possibilities of creat-ing different futures. As Brown reads Nietzsche, the one thingthat the will cannot exert its power over is the past, the “it was”.Confronted with its impotence with respect to the events of thepast, the will is threatened with becoming simply an “angry spec-tator” mired in bitter recognition of its own helplessness. The onehope for the will is that it may, instead, achieve a kind of mastery over that past such that, although “what has happened” cannotbe altered, the past can be denied the power of continuing to de-termine the present and future. It is only this focus on the future, Brown continues, and the capacity to make a future in the face of human frailties and injustices that spares us from a rancorous decline into despair. Identity politics structured by ressentiment – that is, by suffering caused by past events – can only break outof the cycle of “slave morality” by remaking the present againstthe terms of the past, a remaking that requires a “forgetting” of that past. An act of liberation, of self-afﬁrmation, this “forgettingof the past” requires an “overcoming” of the past that offers iden-tity in relationship to suffering, in favour of a future in whichidentity is to be deﬁned differently. In arguing thus, Brown’s work becomes aligned with a posi-tion that sees the way forward for emancipatory politics as re-siding in a movement away from a “politics of memory” (Kilby 2002: 203) that is committed to articulating past injustices andsuffering. While we agree that investment in identities prem-ised upon suffering can function as an obstacle to alleviating the causes of that suffering, we believe that Brown’s argument as outlined is problematic. First, following Kilby (2002), <u>we share a concern about any turn to the future that is ﬁgured as a complete abandonment of the past</u>. This is because <u>for those who have suffered oppression</u> and exclusion, <u>the injunction to give up articulating a pain that is still felt may seem cruel and impossible</u> to meet. We would argue instead that the “<u><strong><mark>turn to the future</u></strong></mark>” that theorists such as Brown and Grosz callfor, to revitalise feminism and other emancipatory politics, <u><strong><mark>need not be conceived of as a brute rejection of the past</u></strong></mark>. Indeed, Brown herself recognises the problems involved here, stating that [since] erased histories and historical invisibility are themselves suchintegral elements of the pain inscribed in most subjugated identities[then] the counsel of forgetting, at least in its unreconstructedNietzschean form, seems inappropriate if not cruel (1995: 74). She implies, in fact, that the demand exerted by those in painmay be no more than the demand to exorcise that pain throughrecognition: “all that such pain may long for – more than revenge– is the chance to be heard into a certain release, recognised intoself-overcoming, incited into possibilities for triumphing over, and hence, losing itself” (1995: 74-75). Brown wishes to establish the political importance of remembering “painful” historical events but with a crucial caveat: that the purpose of remembering pain is to enable its release . The challenge then, according to her,is to create a political culture in which this project does not mutate into one of remembering pain for its own sake. Indeed, if Brown feels that <u>this may be “a pass where we ought to part with Nietzsche</u>” (1995: 74), then Freud may be a more suit-able companion. Since his early work with Breuer, Freud’s writ-ings have suggested the (only apparent) paradox that <u>remember-ing is often a condition of forgetting. The hysterical patient,</u> who is <u>doomed to repeat in symptoms and compulsive actions a past she cannot adequately recall, is helped to remember that trau-matic past in order then to move beyond it: she must remember inorder to forget</u> <u>and to forget in order to be able to live in the present.</u> 7 This model seems to us to be particularly helpful for thedilemma articulated by both Brown (1995) and Kilby (2002),insisting as it does that “forgetting” (at least, loosening the holdof the past, in order to enable the future) cannot be achieved without ﬁrst remembering the traumatic past. Indeed, this wouldseem to be similar to the message of Beloved , whose central motif of haunting (is the adult woman, “Beloved”, Sethe’s murderedchild returned in spectral form?) dramatises the tendency of theunanalysed traumatic past to keep on returning, constraining, asit does so, the present to be like the past, and thereby, disallow-ing the possibility of a future different from that past. As Sarah Ahmed argues in her response to Brown, “<u><strong><mark>in order to break the seal of the past</u></strong></mark>, in order to move away from attach-ments that are hurtful, <u><strong><mark>we must</mark> ﬁrst <mark>bring them into the realm of political action</u></strong></mark>” (2004: 33). We would add that <u>the task of analys-ing the traumatic past, and</u> thus <u><mark>opening</mark> up the possibility of <mark>political action, </mark>is unlikely to be achievable by individuals on their own, but that this, instead, <mark>requires a “community” of participants</u></mark> dedicated to the serious epistemic work of rememberingand interpreting the objective social conditions that made up thatpast and continue in the present. <u><mark>The “pain” of historical injury is <strong>not simply an individual psychological issue</strong>, but stems from</mark> objective <mark>social conditions which perpetuate</mark>, for the most part, forms of <mark>injustice</mark> and inequality into the present. </u>In sum, Brown presents too stark a choice between past andfuture. In the example of Beloved with which we began thisarticle, Paul D’s acceptance of Sethe’s experiences of slavery asdistinct from his own, enable them both to arrive at new under-standings of their experience. Such understanding is a way of partially “undoing” the (effects of) the past and coming to terms with the locatedness of one’s being in the world (Mohanty 1995). As this example shows, opening up a future, and attending to theongoing effects of a traumatic past, are only incorrectly under-stood as alternatives. A second set of problems with Brown’s critique of identity poli-tics emerge from what we regard as her tendency to individualise social problems as problems that are the possession and theresponsibility of the “wounded” group. Brown suggests that <u>the problems associated with identity politics can be overcome through a “shift in the character of political expression</u> and politi-cal claims common to much politicised identity” (1995: 75). She deﬁnes this shift as one <u>in which identity would be expressed in terms of <strong>desire rather than of ontology by supplanting the lan-guage of “I am” with the language of “I want this for us” </u></strong>(1995:75). Such a reconﬁguration, she argues, would create an opportu-nity to “rehabilitate the memory of desire within identiﬁcatory processes…prior to [their] wounding” (1995: 75). <u><strong>It would fur-ther refocus attention on the future possibilities present in theidentity as opposed to the identity being foreclosed through its attention to past-based grievances</u></strong>.</p>",,1NC,Case,127857,114,19303,./documents/ndtceda14/Wyoming/BeJo/Wyoming-Berry-Jones-Neg-UNLV-Round3.docx,571693,N,UNLV,3,Pepperdine EL,Dan Stout,"1AC- Armenian Genocide Aff

One way to reinforce such view is racializing crime, meaning, making crime a peculiar activity in which the poor and people of color are the only ones involved in. The fact that the majority of the inmate population is predominately of color leads to two types of explanations: that crime is something inherent and cultural among the poor and people of color or that the activities in which these people engage in have become criminalized. The first explanation was known in academic circles as the underclass theory. It identified crime, poverty, violence, and other related social ills within a particular social group or culture. This theory has definitely been taken by some powerful politicians. Former Secretary of Education under the Reagan Administration and influential thinker [stretching the term “thinker”] of the Republican Party, William Bennett declared in a public interview: ""[Y]ou could abort every black baby in this country, and your crime rate would go down.2 ” This shows that criminal activity is largely identified only among the poor and people of color. In contrast with such simplistic and border-line racist statements, one can argue that the rate of incarceration among the poor and people of color is high because their activities have become criminalized. One way to clarify this is to analyze the problems with measuring crime. According to the Crime Index published in the Uniform Crime Reports by the FBI, offenses such as murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault as well as property crimes such as burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson compose Crime Index Part I. Part II are less serious crimes such as assaults, forgery and counterfeiting, fraud, embezzlement, stolen property, vandalism, weapons, prostitution, drug abuse violations, gambling, DUI, liquor law violations, drunkenness, disorderly conduct, vagrancy, etc. Most inmates have been incarcerated for violating crimes from Part II, i.e. petty theft, drugs, prostitutions, etc15. What is left out on the Crime Index are white-collar crimes such as organized crime, computer crime, hazardous wastes, price fixing, fee splitting, false advertising, etc. If white collar crimes were reported as such and punished in accordance to their costs, prisons would be filled with middle and upper-class males. As stated above, the common perception of crime among the population is violent crime. It’s believed that most inmates have been charged with violent crimes, and thus they need to be punished with the toughest sentences. That is simply far from the truth. Most inmates are incarcerated for non-violent crimes, primarily drug related crimes. The war on drugs has principally targeted people of color by going after low level street-dealers, “drug enforcement officers perpetuate the myth that the majority of traffickers and users of illegal drugs are people of color.12” Since street-level dealers in urban areas are predominantly Black, they are easier to arrest and, thus, go to jail at a higher rate than the white high-level trafficker. This racialization of drug use can also be found by the laws congress passes. Harsher mandatory sentences are given for crack cocaine, which is more likely to be found on Blacks, than for cocaine powder, which is likely to be found on Whites. Lusane provides an example: “distribution of five grams or more of crack, worth only about $125 on the street, is a five year mandatory sentence. In contrast, it would take 500 grams of powder cocaine, worth about $ 50 000 to receive the same sentence.13” This has further contributed to more police raids in working-class neighborhoods, police brutality against people of color, mass arrests, and other brutal tactics. Examples of these are Memphis’ Operation Invincible, Los Angeles’ Operation Hammer, Chicago’s Operation Clean Sweep, Atlantas’Red Dof Squad and New York’s TNT; not a single upper-class community has been the target of these assaults, although drug use is likely to happen there too.14” While white middle-class drug users go to private doctors to deal with drug addictions, the poor and people of color go to prison. As police enforcement focus more on communities of color, the rate of crime in those communities rises in official reports. Crime in middle and upper-class neighborhoods, especially white-collar crime, is greatly unreported. If it’s reported, the criminal is often a non-member of the community, most likely Black or Latino. This is especially true when cases of rape occur. It’s very common for enforcement agencies to focus more on rape cases where the victim is a middle-class white girl and the perpetrator is a poor Black or Latino male. In contrast, cases where the rapist is white or the victim is black don’t get too much media coverage or police enforcement. This leads people to believe that middle-class neighborhoods are more susceptible to be victims of crime than working-class neighborhoods. In fact, the contrary is true; working class women, Black and Latinas, are more likely to be raped than white middle class women16. Also, a working class house is more likely to be assaulted than a middle or upper class house. In addition, white collar crimes, particularly those committed by corporations (e.g. hazardous wastes, price fixing) have principally affected communities of color. Poor people are not only targeted more by enforcement agencies, but they are also the ones who suffer the most from criminal activities. Within the prison system, social inequalities are also prevalent. The issue of public defenders and jail snitchers should bring attention. Although the constitution guarantees legal counsel, disparities between the poor and the rich greatly affect who receives and who doesn’t receive legal advice. Middle and upper class inmates do not rely on public defenders because they can afford a private lawyer, often, a very good one. Working-class inmates cannot afford private lawyers, thus they must rely on public defenders, whom are overworked and underpaid. According to a Detroit public defender “I often meet my clients, at most, ten minutes before the trial; it’s impossible to put up a case in only ten minutes. Sometimes, I have 50 cases a day.21” What most overloaded public defenders end up doing is encouraging inmates to plead guilty, even if they are innocent, in order to reduce the sentence the judge will give. Immigrant inmates do not even have access to legal council; the constitution does not allow it. Most immigrants on deportation proceedings have to pay for their own lawyer if they want to fight their cases. Most don’t have the means to pay for lawyers and are deported after many months of being detained in ICE facilities. It was shown that the main reason why people of color are incarcerated at a greater rate than whites is the fact that enforcement agencies primarily target communities of color. Thus, it’s not surprising that Black and Latino males make the majority of the inmate population. However, it’s important to analyze what are the effects of greater policing and more incarceration on subordinate populations; and how this effect perpetuates the role of subordination. Furthermore, this analysis needs to relate the economic restructuring and social unrest described previously. The majority of inmates are young Black males, although the number of female inmates has been increasing lately. Most of these Black males have left Black families without the support of their income, however little it could have been. Single Black mothers now have to raise their children with only minimum, and in many cases subminimum, especially in urban areas, wages. Since economic restructuring of the eighties has cut back almost all social services which could have aided single Black mothers, they are left with solely their labor power, mostly unskilled and degraded. With the rise of the service economy, these women became the main providers of cheap labor, or have become part of the McDonalization of the workforce. Facing such grim possibilities of earning higher income and little financial aid for education, many of these women opt out for either engaging in the drug industry or prostitution. As it is usual with males, Black females are also harassed by the police. They are victims of sexual abuse by officers; in New York City, prostitutes are likely to provide free sexual services to police officers first, then they get arrested. Since the incarceration of poor females is increasing, the children of the poor are left with no parents, deficient education, and a hostile environment. They will become the next inmates of future prisons.

In contrast, it would take 500 grams of powder cocaine, worth about $ 50 000 to receive the same sentence.13” This has further contributed to more police raids in working-class neighborhoods, police brutality against people of color, mass arrests, and other brutal tactics. Examples of these are Memphis’ Operation Invincible, Los Angeles’ Operation Hammer, Chicago’s Operation Clean Sweep, Atlantas’Red Dof Squad and New York’s TNT; not a single upper-class community has been the target of these assaults, although drug use is likely to happen there too.14” While white middle-class drug users go to private doctors to deal with drug addictions, the poor and people of color go to prison. As police enforcement focus more on communities of color, the rate of crime in those communities rises in official reports. Crime in middle and upper-class neighborhoods, especially white-collar crime, is greatly unreported. If it’s reported, the criminal is often a non-member of the community, most likely Black or Latino. This is especially true when cases of rape occur. It’s very common for enforcement agencies to focus more on rape cases where the victim is a middle-class white girl and the perpetrator is a poor Black or Latino male. In contrast, cases where the rapist is white or the victim is black don’t get too much media coverage or police enforcement. This leads people to believe that middle-class neighborhoods are more susceptible to be victims of crime than working-class neighborhoods. In fact, the contrary is true; working class women, Black and Latinas, are more likely to be raped than white middle class women16. Also, a working class house is more likely to be assaulted than a middle or upper class house. In addition, white collar crimes, particularly those committed by corporations (e.g. hazardous wastes, price fixing) have principally affected communities of color. Poor people are not only targeted more by enforcement agencies, but they are also the ones who suffer the most from criminal activities. <u><strong><mark>Within the prison system</mark>, social inequalities are also prevalent. The issue of public defenders and jail snitchers should bring attention.</u></strong> Although the constitution guarantees legal counsel, <u><strong><mark>disparities between the poor and the rich greatly affect who receives and who doesn’t receive legal advice. Middle and upper class inmates </mark>do not rely on public defenders because they <mark>can afford a private lawyer</u></strong></mark>, <u><strong>often, a very good one. <mark>Working-class inmates </mark>cannot afford private lawyers, thus they <mark>must rely on public defenders</u></strong></mark>, whom are overworked and underpaid. <u><strong>According to a Detroit public defender “I often meet my clients, at most, ten minutes before the trial;</u></strong> it’s impossible to put up a case in only ten minutes. <u><strong>Sometimes, I have 50 cases a day</u></strong>.21” What most overloaded public defenders end up doing is encouraging inmates to plead guilty, even if they are innocent, in order to reduce the sentence the judge will give. Immigrant inmates do not even have access to legal council; the constitution does not allow it. Most immigrants on deportation proceedings have to pay for their own lawyer if they want to fight their cases. Most don’t have the means to pay for lawyers and are deported after many months of being detained in ICE facilities. It was shown that the main reason why people of color are incarcerated at a greater rate than whites is the fact that enforcement agencies primarily target communities of color. Thus, it’s not surprising that Black and <u><strong><mark>Latino males make the majority of the inmate population. However, it’s important to analyze what are the effects of greater policing and more incarceration on subordinate populations</mark>; and how this effect perpetuates the role of subordination.</u></strong> Furthermore, this analysis needs to relate the economic restructuring and social unrest described previously. <u><strong><mark>The majority of inmates are young Black males, although </mark>the number of <mark>female inmates has been increasing lately</mark>. Most of these Black males have left Black families without the support of their income</u></strong>, however little it could have been. <u><strong><mark>Single Black mothers now have to raise their children with only minimum, and in many cases subminimum, </mark>especially in urban areas, <mark>wages</mark>. <mark>Since economic restructuring </mark>of the eighties <mark>has cut back almost all social services which could have aided single Black mothers, </mark>they are left with solely their labor power, mostly unskilled and degraded.</u></strong> With the rise of the service economy, <u><strong><mark>these women became the main providers of cheap labor, or have become part of the McDonalization of the workforce.</u></strong></mark> <u><strong><mark>Facing such grim possibilities</u></strong></mark> of earning higher income and little financial aid for education, <u><strong><mark>many of these women opt out for either engaging in the drug industry or prostitution. As it is usual with males, Black females are also harassed by the police</u></strong></mark>. They are victims of sexual abuse by officers; in New York City, <u><strong>prostitutes are likely to provide free sexual services to police officers first, <mark>then they get arrested</mark>. <mark>Since the incarceration of poor females is increasing, the</mark> <mark>children of the poor are left with no parents</mark>, deficient education, and a hostile environment. <mark>They will become the next inmates of future prisons. Thus, the cycle continues.</mark> </p></u></strong>",2NC,,Crime Links,455417,1,19329,./documents/ndtceda14/Wyoming/DiMa/Wyoming-Dilldine-Marcum-Neg-UMKC-Round2.docx,571662,N,UMKC,2,Weber State CS,Kersch,"1AC- Jihad
