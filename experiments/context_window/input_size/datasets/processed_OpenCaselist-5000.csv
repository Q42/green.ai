"Nancy, Professor @ UC Berkeley, “Rotten trade: millennial capitalism, human values and global justice in organs trafficking”, Journal of Human Rights, Vol. 2, No. 2, June, 197–226, AB
The 'demand' for human organs, tissues, and body parts — and the desperate search among wealthy transplant patients to purchase them — is driven, above all, by the medical discourse on scarcity. The specter of long transplant 'waiting lists' — sometimes only virtual lists with little material basis in reality I — has motivated and driven questionable practices of organ harvesting with blatant sales alongside 'compensated gifting', doctors acting as brokers, and fierce competition between public and private hospitals for patients of means. But the very idea of organ 'scarcity' is what Ivan Illich (1970) would call an artificially created need, invented by transplant technicians and dangled before the eyes of an ever- expanding sick, aging and dying population. The resulting artificially created organs scarcity is 'misrecognized' (Bourdieu 1977) as a natural medical phenomenon. In this environment of 'survivalist' utilitarian pragmatics, the ethics of transplantation is modeled after classical 'lifeboat' ethics (Koch 2001). With ethical presumptions of scarcity, there appear to be clear choices to be made, namely who gets into the lifeboat ('getting on the waiting list'); who will be shoved off the boat when it gets overcrowded (getting triaged while on the waiting list); and who will, in the end, be 'eaten' so that others may live (race and class disparities in organs procurement and distribution practices)? There is little consciousness of the vulnerability of some social classes and ethnic groups who can be described as the 'designated donor' populations, both living and brain dead. In the United States, for example, where cadaver transplant continues to be supported as the norm for donation (if not so, increasingly, in practice), the brain dead are drawn from a population that is disproportionately poor — including whites, Latinos and African- Americans. The poor and minorities are over-represented in the intensive care centers (ICUs) of large urban hospitals, due to their over-exposure to urban violence, higher rates of homicide, suicide and vehicular death, as well as the cumulative effects of societal and medical neglect. The great irony is that those lacking public insurance (44 million citizens) also comprise the greatest number of those whose family members are asked to behave altruistically and to donate the organs and tissues of loved ones. That a great many of these poor, African-American and Latino families refuse to donate should come as no surprise. They are being asked to support with the bodies of their loved ones a social and medical system that excludes them and within which they have a lower probability of receiving an organ, should that need arise. One needs to be relatively affluent and otherwise healthy and well looked after to be recommended for organ transplant. The much commented upon refusal of African-Americans to donate organs should be seen as a political act of considered resistance. As for living, paid donation, the social inequities are more transparent. Those who sell a kidney are normally from social and economic strata where access to basic medical care and necessary aftercare are most often lacking. But to date the only dissident voices raised against the dominant transplant narrative of life-saving come from far afield and are generally expressed in unpalatable forms that are all too easily dismissed and discredited. These alternative bioethical positions are often expressed 'primitively' and from the social margins in the form of rumors and moral panics of body theft and organ stealing, some of which turns out not to be so groundless after all. To a great many of those living on the fringes of the new global disorder, the scramble for 'fresh' organs and tissues increases their profound sense of ontological insecurity in a world that values their bodies as a reservoir of spare parts (Scheper-Hughes 1996). While popular resistance in Mexico and Brazil led to revoking new and progressivist laws of presumed consent for the purposes of harvesting organs, such resistance has been ineffectual or lacking with respect to the growth of the international organs market, as those on all sides of the transplant equation have began to accept as normal and routine these nonetheless still largely covert transactions protected by transplant medicine's coyly averted gaze. Throughout these radical transformations, the voice of anthropology has been muted while the high-stake debates have been waged among transplant professionals, bioethicists, legal scholars and economists. But what other human science and discipline is better suited than anthropology to interrogate values and practices from a position of epistemological openness and to offer radical alternatives to the limited pragmatic utilitarianism that dominates medical bioethical thinking today?",summarize the following text: ,"The 'demand' for human organs, tissues, and body parts is driven, by the medical discourse on scarcity The specter of long transplant 'waiting lists' only virtual lists with little material basis in reality motivated questionable practices of organ harvesting with 'compensated gifting' doctors acting as brokers the very idea of organ 'scarcity' is an artificially created need invented by transplant technicians and dangled before the eyes of an ever- expanding sick, aging and dying population The resulting artificially created organs scarcity is 'misrecognized' as a natural medical phenomenon.

"On the Latin American street, the Organization of American States has always borne a reputation, often undeserved, as Washington’s lackey. But the OAS, based in Washington, just sent the western hemisphere a message the White House would rather not hear: It’s time to seriously discuss legalizing marijuana as one means of reducing harrowing drug violence. That conclusion, from a study presented last Friday in Bogotá, Colombia, by OAS Secretary-General José Miguel Insulza, is one that a growing number of Latin American governments — including Uruguay, which might legalize marijuana this year — are urging the Obama Administration to accept. Having the motion seconded by Washington’s “lackey” makes it harder to ignore. But even as Insulza and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos were hailing the OAS report last week, something else was brewing in Bogotá that could further undermine resistance to pot legalization. The Colombian capital is about to start a program that uses marijuana to wean junkies off bazuco, a cheap but fiercely addictive cocaine paste. It will mark one of the largest experiments_old to determine if marijuana — which legalization opponents still insist is a “gateway” to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin — is in reality an “exit” drug. If so, it will only serve to reinforce the argument, mentioned by the OAS study, that marijuana is a relatively benign drug, far more comparable to alcohol than it is, say, to crystal meth. (MORE: Legalizing Marijuana and Other Ways the U.S. and Mexico Can Win the Drug War) As Miami Herald South America correspondent Jim Wyss recently wrote from Bogotá, “For the most desperate [bazuco] users, the cannabis cure may be the only way out.” Or as one social worker told Wyss, “We want people to quit a substance that is very, very damaging and transition to something less dangerous and which will allow them to function in society.” Critics say the effort will just turn bazuco zombies into potheads. But for years now, similar projects in countries like Brazil, Jamaica and most recently Canada have indicated that marijuana is in fact an effective exit drug. In British Columbia last fall, a team of U.S. and Canadian addiction researchers determined that “clinical trials on cannabis substitution for problematic substance abuse appear justified.” That doesn’t mean we should all start smoking herb like Harold and Kumar. The fact that a glass of hot bourbon can relieve common cold symptoms doesn’t mean we should all start drinking Manhattans, either. But affirming marijuana as an exit drug would lead us to reconsider one of modern society’s most glaring double standards: booze good, pot bad. It would reinforce the notion that moderate marijuana use is not more perilous than moderate alcohol consumption. According to studies, in fact, pot smoking in some cases can be a preferable alternative to drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco.

The OAS’s $2 million report “The Drug Problem in the Americas” seems to ask the same thing. It is not an outright call for marijuana legalization. It is, as Insulza said in Bogotá, “the beginning of a long-awaited discussion” about “more realistic [drug war] policies.” Most Latin American leaders — whose countries suffer the bloody brunt of the largely failed U.S.-led drug war — already made it clear to President Obama at last year’s Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, that it’s high time to ask whether marijuana legalization might help reduce drug cartel revenues and therefore drug cartel mayhem. (Studies indicate it could rob Mexico’s narco-mafias of a third of the estimated $30 billion they rake in each year.) Insulza acknowledged the current “disposition” throughout the Americas to “deal with the legalization issue,” and he called for “greater flexibility” on the part of nations like the U.S. The 400-page OAS study itself concludes that trends in the hemisphere “lean toward decriminalization or legalization of the production, sale and use of marijuana. Sooner or later, decisions in this area will need to be taken.” Santos, who is widely considered Washington’s closest ally in Latin America today, has not yet endorsed legalization, but he said the report should help drug-war battered countries like his “seek better solutions” than the conventional interdiction strategy Washington still pushes.

"There’s a sort of Hegelian contradiction at the heart of all academic political theory that has pretensions of being emancipatory.  In a nutshell, the question is that of how this theory can avoid being a sort of commodity.  Using Hegel as a model, this contradiction goes something like this:  emancipatory political theory says it’s undertaken for the sake of emancipation from x.  Yet with rare exceptions, it is only published in academicjournals that few have access to, in a jargon that only other academics or the highly literate can understand, and presented only at conferencesthat only other academics generally attend. Thus, academic emancipatory political theory reveals itself in its truth as something that isn’t aimed at political change or intervention at all, but rather only as a move or moment in the ongoing autopoiesis of academia. That is, it functions as another line on the CVand is one strategy through which the university system carries out its autopoiesis or self-reproduction across time. It thus functions– the issue isn’t here one of the beliefs or intentions of academics, but how things function –as something like a commodity within the academic system. The function is not to intervene in the broader political system– despite what all of us doing political theory say and how we think about our work –but rather to carry out yet another iteration of the academic discourse (there are other ways that this is done, this has just been a particularly effective rhetorical strategy for the autopoiesis of academia in the humanities). Were the aim political change, then the discourse would have to find a way to reach outside the academy, but this is precisely what academic political theory cannot do due to the publication and presentation structure, publish or perish logic, the CV, and so on. To produce political change, the academic political theorist would have to sacrifice his or her erudition or scholarship, because they would have to presume an audience that doesn’t have a high falutin intellectual background in Hegel, Adorno, Badiou, set theory, Deleuze, Lacan, Zizek, Foucault (who is one of the few that was a breakaway figure), etc. They would also have to adopt a different platform of communication. Why? Because they would have to address an audience beyond the confines of the academy, which means something other than academic presses, conferences, journals, etc. (And here I would say that us Marxists are often the worst of the worst. We engage in a discourse bordering on medieval scholasticism that only schoolmen can appreciate, which presents a fundamental contradiction between the form of their discourse– only other experts can understand it –and the content; they want to produce change). But the academic emancipatory political theorist can’t do either of these things. If they surrender their erudition and the baroque nature of their discourse, they surrender their place in the academy (notice the way in which Naomi Klein is sneered at in political theory circles despite the appreciable impact of her work). If they adopt other platforms of communication– and this touches on my last post and the way philosophers sneer at the idea that there’s a necessity to investigating extra-philosophical conditions of their discourse –then they surrender their labor requirements as people working within academia. Both options are foreclosed by the sociological conditions of their discourse. The paradox of emancipatory academic political discourse is thus that it is formally and functionally apolitical. At the level of its intention or what it says it aims to effect political change and intervention, but at the level of what it does, it simply reproduces its own discourse and labor conditions without intervening in broader social fields (and no, the classroom doesn’t count). Unconscious recognition of this paradox might be why, in some corners, we’re seeing the execrable call to re-stablish “the party”. The party is the academic fantasy of a philosopher-king or an academic avant gard that simultaneously gets to be an academic and produce political change for all those “dopes and illiterate” that characterize the people (somehow the issue of how the party eventually becomes an end in itself, aimed solely at perpetuating itself, thereby divorcing itself from the people never gets addressed by these neo-totalitarians).  The idea of the party and of the intellectual avant gard is a symptom of unconscious recognition of the paradox I’ve recognized here and of the political theorist that genuinely wants to produce change while also recognizing that the sociological structure of the academy can’t meet those requirements.  Given these reflections, one wishes that the academic that’s learned the rhetoric of politics as an autopoieticstrategy for reproducing the university discourse would be a little less pompous and self-righteous, but everyone has to feel important and like their the best thing since sliced bread, I guess.",summarize the following text: ,"There’s a contradiction at the heart of all academic political theory that has pretensions of being emancipatory. the question is that of how this theory can avoid being a sort of commodity Thus academic emancipatory theory reveals itself as something that isn’t aimed at political change or intervention but rather only as a moment in the ongoing autopoiesis of academia it functions as another line on the CVand is one strategy through which the university system carries out its self-reproduction It thus functions the issue isn’t here one of the beliefs or intentions of academics as something like a commodity within the academic system.

"Nuclear war more likely than ever: threat comes from South Asia and nuke terrorists The humanity has inched closer to the precipice of an all-out nuclear war than ever before, closer than it was even at the height of the historic Cold War standoff between the US and the Soviet Union.

It brought home the danger of nuclear weapons and led to the non-proliferation regime as conceived by the so-called ""nuclear club,"" which included the Soviet Union, the US, Britain, France and China. Under the NPT, only countries that made and set off a nuclear bomb prior to January 1, 1967 were granted the status of a nuclear power. Washington, London and Moscow were the first to sign the treaty in 1968, with Paris and Beijing committing themselves to it years later. But all of the signatories abided by the rules. Those times have passed. NPT controls have become so loose and new nuclear powers so numerous, there’s no counting them anymore. India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea have never even applied for ""nuclear club"" membership. On the contrary, they created their own shadow club with no rules. The official club with all its nukes poses less threat to the human race than this bunch of neophytes. Volatility has spread, though South Asia plays a separate role in it.

You shouldn’t be lulled by their seeming locality though, since a precise nuclear strike will be felt globally, says PIR Center Internet Project Director Andrei Baklitsky. ""A nuclear conflict will have dramatic consequences for all of us, because nuclear weapons are weapons of mass destruction. They are not selective. A nuclear attack in the Middle East would be most tragic, first of all, because of its huge oil fields, and a burning oil field is a big trouble. Secondly, any strike on the Middle East will skyrocket oil prices across the world and plunge the global economy back into an even worse economic crisis that before. The consequences of using an A-bomb in an Indo-Pakistani conflict would be just as grave for these densely populated countries, driving millions of refugees out of their homes and turning agriculture lands into barren wastes."" Unfortunately, the world is home to many paradoxes. Despite a drop in amounts of nuclear weapons worldwide, the collapse of the bipolar world has made the risk of a manmade apocalypse palpable.",summarize the following text: ,"The humanity has inched closer to the precipice of an all-out nuclear war than ever before, closer than it was even at the height of the historic Cold War standoff between the US and the Soviet Union. The main reason is the erosion of the non-proliferation regime experts say. The Non-Proliferation Treaty has been continuously bashed as ""unfair,"" but it is in fact the exclusive geopolitical environment and ensuing nuclear responsibility of a handful of states that has so far kept mankind away from the total wipeout. The theory of reciprocal deterrence wasn’t there all the time. A long two decades after the A-bomb was invented, the powers who had it in their arsenals thought of it as fair game, a weapon you could actually use in a conflict, rather than a deterrent. India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea have never even applied for ""nuclear club"" Volatility has spread, though South Asia plays a separate role in it. 30 to 40 countries are on their way towards nuclear status. Many of them are inches away, like Germany, Japan and Canada, who could have had an A-bomb long ago – but simply didn’t wish to. The Sunni Saudi Arabia has hinted it will make a bomb the moment the Shiite Iran lays its hands on one. Nuclear terrorism is another problem Terrorists can’t make a nuke. But they do know how to pit countries and eventually provoke them to an inadequate response. There’s no lacking of short-sighted politicians who can take that last step, for instance Republican Senator Steve Buyer who nudged the government after 9/11 to nuke Tora Bora caves, instead of sending a task force to Afghanistan.

"Associate Professor of Law, Vanderbilt Law School. (Anne, REGULATING THE SELF: AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL PERFORMANCES IN OUTSIDER SCHOLARSHIP, 81 Va. L. Rev. 1229)
IV. The Autobiographical Self  The outsider narratives do not reflect on another feature of autobiographical discourse that is perhaps the most significant obstacle to their goal to bring to law an understanding of the human self that will supersede the liberal individual. Contrary to the outsiders' claim that their personalized discourse infuses law with their distinctive experiences and political perspectives, numerous historians and critics of autobiography have insisted that those who participate in autobiographical discourse speak not in a different voice, but in a common voice that reflects their membership in a culture devoted to liberal values. n206 As Sacvan Bercovitch puts it, American cultural ideals, including specifically the mythic connection between the ""heroic individual ... [and] the values of free enterprise,"" are ""epitomized in autobiography."" n207 In his seminal essay on the subject, Professor Georges Gusdorf makes an observation that seems like a prescient warning to outsiders who would appropriate autobiography as their voice. He remarks that the practice of writing about one's own self reflects a belief in the autonomous individual, which is ""peculiar to Western man, a concern that has been of good use in his systematic conquest of the [*1285] universe and that he has communicated to men of other cultures; but those men will thereby have been annexed by a sort of intellectual colonizing to a mentality that was not their own."" n208 Similarly, Albert Stone, a critic of American autobiography, argues that autobiographical performances celebrate the Western ideal of individualism, ""which places the self at the center of its world."" n209 Stone begins to elucidate the prescriptive character of autobiographical discourse as he notes with wonder ""the tenacious social ideal whose persistence is all the more significant when found repeated in personal histories of Afro-Americans, immigrants, penitentiary prisoners, and others whose claims to full individuality have often been denied by our society."" n210 Precisely because it appeals to readers' fascination with the self-sufficiency, resiliency and uniqueness of the totemic individual privileged by liberal political theory, there is a risk that autobiographical discourse is a fallible, even co-opted, instrument for the social reforms envisioned by the outsiders. By affirming the myths of individual success in our culture, autobiography reproduces the [*1286] political, economic, social and psychological structures that attend such success. n211 In this light, the outsider autobiographies unwittingly deflect attention from collective social responsibility and thwart the development of collective solutions for the eradication of racist and sexist harms. Although we may suspect in some cases that the author's own sense of self was shaped by a community whose values oppose those of liberal individualism, her decision to register her experience in autobiographical discourse will have a significant effect on the self she reproduces. n212 Her story will solicit the public's attention to the life of one individual, and it will privilege her individual desires and rights above the needs and obligations of a collectivity. Moreover, literary theorists have remarked the tendency of autobiographical discourse to override radical authorial intention. Even where the autobiographer self-consciously determines to resist liberal ideology and represents her life story as the occasion to announce an alternative political theory, ""the relentless individualism of the genre subordinates"" her political critique. n213 Inevitably, at least within American culture, the personal narrative engrosses the readers' imagination. Fascinated by the travails and triumphs of the developing autobiographical self, readers tend to construe the text's political and social observations only as another aspect of the author's personality. Paradoxically, although autobiography is the product of a culture that cultivates human individuality, the genre seems to make available only a limited number of autobiographical protagonists. n214 Many theorists have noticed that when an author assumes the task of defining her own, unique subjectivity, she invariably reproduces herself as a character with whom culture already is well-acquainted. n215 While a variety of forces coerce the autobiographer [*1287] to conform to culturally sanctioned human models, n216 the pressures exerted by the literary market surely play a significant role. The autobiographer who desires a material benefit from her performance must adopt a persona that is intelligible, if not enticing, to her audience. n217 As I will illustrate in the sections that follow, the outsider narratives capitalize on, rather than subvert, autobiographical protagonists that serve the values of liberalism.",summarize the following text: ,"Contrary to the outsiders' claim that their personalized discourse infuses law with their distinctive experiences and perspectives those who participate in autobiographical discourse speak not in a different voice, but in a common voice that reflects their membership in a culture devoted to liberal values the practice of writing about one's own self reflects a belief in the autonomous individual because it appeals to readers' fascination with the self-sufficiency, resiliency and uniqueness autobiographical discourse is a co-opted instrument for the social reforms envisioned by the outsiders By affirming the myths of individual success autobiography reproduces the political, economic, social and psychological structures that attend such success outsider autobiographies unwittingly deflect attention from collective social responsibility and thwart the development of collective solutions for the eradication of racist and sexist harms Although we suspect the author oppose liberal individualism, her decision to register her experience in autobiographical discourse will have a significant effect on the self she reproduces theorists remarked the tendency of autobiographical discourse to override radical authorial intention Even where the autobiographer self-consciously determines to resist liberal ideology the relentless individualism of the genre subordinates"" her political critique. when an author assumes the task of defining her own subjectivity she invariably reproduces herself as a character with whom culture already is well-acquainted the pressures exerted by the literary market surely play a significant role The autobiographer who desires a benefit from her performance must adopt a persona that is intelligible, if not enticing, to her audience the outsider narratives capitalize on, rather than subvert, autobiographical protagonists that serve the values of liberalism"
"So, what does the prospect of a UN summit on drug policy means for the drug policy reform movement, and what can be expected from it? There have been after all quite a few similar events since the Adoption of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Will 2016 be the year when reality finally sinks in within the international community that drug prohibition has failed and that it is time to look for more sustainable alternatives? There are good reasons to believe so.¶ The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances set lofty goals of complete eradication of drug use, toned down to a 50% reduction within 10 years in 1988, a goal reiterated in 1998, but abandoned altogether in 2008 amidst growing restlessness within the UN community. Furthermore, the “soft on drugs” label is rapidly losing its stickiness as the political risk of drug reformist positions is plummeting rapidly. Drug policy reform may even start turning into political asset in some circumscriptions, as was the case in Washington this November, when most of the Democrat political establishment lined up behind the legalization initiative.¶ As the consensus behind the War on Drugs starts crumbling, and as countries start breaking ranks and reject the dominant approach to drug policy altogether, the international community will see reduced opportunities for reprisals and sanctions. Uruguay’s intention to legalize marijuana under state control has been met with rather muted UN opposition so far. Sanctions against Uruguay will be hard to justify if similar sanctions are not imposed on Washington and Colorado, a prospect not even remotely likely, and may just galvanize regional rancor. Other Latin American countries might emulate the Uruguayan model, with neighboring Argentina a real potential candidate.¶ In the US, the number of medical marijuana states is likely to reach 20 in 2013 as proposals are set to be presented to several state legislatures, including New Hampshire, Illinois and New York. Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, and Massachusetts, as well as Oregon and Montana may also try to adopt full marijuana legalization through their legislatures, while a legalization initiative is already on the drawing board in California. The battle has even been brought to the US Congress, with a bipartisan bill that would enable the states to make their own marijuana laws. The bill is probably still symbolic at this stage, and stands very little chances, but it may be a harbinger of things to come.¶ Embroiled in a deep economic and financial crisis, Europe is staying relatively on the sidelines on drug policy issues, even though (or maybe because), European drug policies are generally leaning on the liberal side and drug abuse is substantially lower there than in the US.¶ Ultimately, the fate of the 2016 special session lies most likely in Washington DC. The US has been the initiator, main architect and chief sponsor of the prohibitionist approach for over a century, and has over the years imposed her prohibitionist policies to the rest of the world. All current international treaties on illicit drugs having been produced and backed by successive US administrations over the past 50 years, a complete U-turn seems unlikely. But with 18 states and the district of Colombia in oblique violation of the international treaties and Colorado and Washington now squarely confronting them, the “tough on drugs” stance is increasingly untenable. Unless it reverses its attitude and draws the lessons from a century of failed prohibitionist rule, the US will be increasingly stuck between a rock and a hard place and her prohibitionist-in-chief posture will become more and more indefensible.¶ I have argued for quite some time that drug policy reform will be achieved by cracking the US prohibitionist backbone through the combined internal pressure from the states and external pressure from the US allies, principally, in Latin America. In a truly historic year for drug policy reform, the pieces of the global drug policy reform puzzle appeared to be falling into place one by one in 2012, and the US resolve seems to be faltering. The Obama administration appears hesitant after the decisive victories for marijuana legalization in Colorado and Washington. By intensifying the crackdown on medical marijuana over the past few years, Obama brought the War on Drugs to the Caucasian community, which may have further galvanized support for legalization. Whether hidden agenda or law of unintended consequences, it clearly narrowed the administration’s margins of maneuver and crackdowns on the newly legalized marijuana states may backfire even more, further stiffening support for legalization. ¶ While the 2016 special session could easily be derailed, if drug policy reformists, especially in Latin American and within the US, use the next three years to keep resolutely pushing for reform, we may see the emergence of a global coalition and a new global consensus on drug policy. This is an opportunity that reform activists cannot afford to waste.",summarize the following text: ,"Will 2016 be the year when reality finally sinks in within the international community that drug prohibition has failed and that it is time to look for more sustainable alternatives?

"Central to the arguments for the conceptual innovation of environmental or ecological security41 is its mobilization potential. As Buzan points out, the concept of national security ""has an enormous power as an instrument of social and political mobilization"" and, therefore, ""the obvious reason for putting environmental issues into the security agenda is the possible magni tude of the threats posed, and the need to mobilize urgent and unprece dented responses to them. The security label is a useful way both of sig nalling danger and setting priority, and for this reason alone it is likely to per sist in the environmental debates.""42 Several analysts have, however, warned against securitization of the environmental issue for some of these very rea sons, and some of the arguments I present here fit into the principled issue of securitization/desecuritization as discussed earlier in this chapter. A first argument against the environment as a security issue, mentioned, for exam ple, by Buzan, is that environmental threats are generally unintentional.43 This, by itself, does not make the threats any less serious, although it does take them out of the realm of will. As I pointed out earlier, the field of secu rity is constituted around relationships between wills: It has been, conventionally, about the efforts of one will to (allegedly) override the sovereignty of another, forcing or tempting the latter not to assert its will in defense of its sovereignty. The contest of concern, in other words, is among strategic actors imbued with intentionality, and this has been the logic around which the whole issue of security has been framed. In light of my earlier discussion, in which I stressed that ""security"" is not a reflection of our everyday sense of the word but, rather, a specific field with traditions, the jump to environ­mental security becomes much larger than might appear at first to be the case. I do not present this as an argument against the concept but, rather, as a way of illuminating or even explaining the debate over it. Second in his critique of the notion of environmental security, Richard Moss points out that the concept of ""security"" tends to imply that defense from the problem is to be provided by the state: The most serious consequence of thinking of global change and other environmental problems as threats to security is that the sorts of centralized governmental responses by powerful and autonomous state organizations that are appropriate for security threats are inappropriate for addressing most environmental problems. When one is reacting to the threat of organized external violence, military and intelligence institutions are empowered to take the measures required to repel the threat. By this same logic, when responding to environmental threats, response by centralized regulatory agencies would seem to be logical. Unfortunately, in most cases this sort of response is not the most efficient or effective way of addressing environ mental problems, particularly those that have a global character.44 Moss goes on to warn that ""the instinct for centralized state responses to security threats is highly inappropriate for responding effectively to glob al environmental problems.""45 It might, he points out, even lead to militarization of environmental problems .46 A third warning, not unrelated to the previous two, is the tendency for the concept of security to produce thinking in terms of us-them, which could then be captured by the logic of nationalism. Dan Deudney writes that ""the 'nation' is not an empty vessel or blank slate waiting to be filled or scripted, but is instead profoundly linked to war and 'us vs. them' thinking ( . . . ) Of course, taking the war and 'us vs. them' thinking out of national ism is a noble goal. But this may be like taking sex out of 'rock and roll,' a project whose feasibility declines when one remembers that 'rock and roll' was originally coined as a euphemism for sex.""47 The tendency toward ""us vs. them"" thinking, and the general tradition of viewing threats as coming from outside a state's own borders, are, in this instance, also likely to direct attention away from one's own contributions to environmental problems."" Finally, there is the more political warning that the concept of security is basically defensive in nature, a status quo concept defending that which is, even though it does not necessarily deserve to be protected. In a paradoxical way, this politically conservative bias has also led to warnings by some that the concept of environmental security could become a dangerous tool of the ""totalitarian left,"" which might attempt to relaunch itself on the basis of environmental collectivism."" Certainly, there is some risk that the logic of ecology, with its religious potentials and references to holistic categories, survival and the linked significance of everything, might easily lend itself to totalitarian projects, where also the science of ecology has focused largely on how to constrain, limit, and control activities in the name of the environment.",summarize the following text: ,"environmental security is its mobilization potential the obvious reason for putting environmental issues into the security agenda is the possible magni tude of the threats posed, and the need to mobilize urgent and unprece dented responses to them.

"Getting young people engaged in politics is never easy, but voter-registration volunteers say the medical-marijuana amendment on November's ballot is attracting new voters who otherwise might not bother with a midterm election. Both political parties for more than a year have been knocking on doors to energize supporters who might be lured to the polls by a heated governor's race. Democrats are especially eager to avoid the usual big drop-off of turnout in nonpresidential elections, which tends to hurt their party's candidates. But the wild card this year — the factor most likely to motivate new voters — appears to be the marijuana measure, along with another constitutional amendment that would provide special state funding to conserve environmentally sensitive land. ""Young people are very unfamiliar with other elections going on but have heard about the medical-marijuana amendment and are excited to have an opportunity to vote for that,"" said Anna Eskamani, 23, a volunteer with the League of Women Voters who recruited passers-by at a farmers' market in Orlando last week. ""It's definitely going to be a hot topic that will get young people out and, of course, encourage them to vote on other things as well."" The proposed amendment would legalize marijuana for patients diagnosed with debilitating health problems. Although it would directly affect a relatively small number of people, it has drawn widespread interest because many voters see it leading to a broader decriminalization of marijuana. A recent statewide poll by Quinnipiac University found that 88 percent of voters supported it. The environmental amendment would devote a portion of state excise taxes to conserving land and wildlife. ""It has to do with drinking water and protecting our rivers and lakes and the Everglades. That's an issue a lot people do feel strongly about,"" said Lynne Joshi, president of the League of Women Voters in Broward County. ""With the amendments, we have a chance, especially with the younger people, for more people to turn out."" A League forum in West Palm Beach last month to discuss the environmental amendment drew enough voters to fill a school auditorium. ""There are always those voters who would not come out and do such a thing until they feel there's a direct effect on them,"" said Geanine Wester, the League president in Palm Beach County. If the parties and registration groups succeed, the 2014 election will buck a seesaw trend in Florida marked by wild swings in turnout rates among registered voters. Turnout soared from 47 percent in the 2006 midterm election to 75 percent in the 2008 presidential election. The rate plunged to 49 percent in the 2010 midterms, then rose to 72 percent in the 2012 presidential election. Most registration campaigns target young adults and Hispanics because they are the most inclined to vote in presidential-election years but skip midterms. ""In parts of Orlando, Osceola County and South Florida, you don't see a drop-off, you see a plunge,"" said Christian Ulvert, political director of the Florida Democratic Party. ""You see turnout in areas with high Hispanic voters go from 88 percent in a presidential year down to 25 or 26 percent in a gubernatorial year."" The party is trying to counter the trend by emphasizing the importance of midterm elections. The Democratic National Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, also has hired Zach Learner, a Fort Lauderdale attorney, to head a Voter Expansion Project designed to help overcome voter confusion and perceived barriers. He will lead a small army of volunteer lawyers to educate people about voting methods — such as early voting, mail-in voting and provisional ballots — and to safeguard their rights at polling places. Many volunteers were inspired by the tumultuous 2000 presidential election, decided in Florida after five weeks of recounts and disputes. ""I saw what happened in 2000, and I became concerned that citizens were either not going to be able to vote or might not understand what they needed to do to allow them to vote,"" said Jason B. Blank, of Fort Lauderdale, a volunteer attorney ready to advise voters who run into problems. Republicans, meanwhile, are culling through vast amounts of data on Floridians to spot potential like-minded voters who might be inclined to support Scott. They call it ""the largest micro-targeting project in Florida history."" ""It's millions of data points on voters that have been assembled, and it can help predict which voters are likely to support the governor,"" said Susan Hepworth, communications director for the state Republicans. Even a slight increase in registration and turnout could tip the results of a close election. ""On the margins, the marijuana amendment may bring people to the polls who normally wait till there's a presidential candidate on the ballot,"" said Daniel Smith, political science professor at the University of Florida.

"Pragmatism and Footprinting¶ Environmental pragmatism is a relatively new field of environmental ethics that seeks to move beyond the strictly theoretical exercises normal in philosophy and allows the environmental movement to formulate substantial new policies (Light, 1). Environmental Pragmatism was initially posited by Bryan Norton and evolved to not take a stance over the dispute between non-anthropocentric and anthropocentric ethics. Distancing himself from this dispute, he preferred to distinguish between strong and weak anthropocentricism (Light, 290-291, 298). The main philosophers involved in advancing the debate in environmental pragmatism include Eric Katz, Andrew Light, and Bryan Norton. This particular discipline advocates moral pluralism, implying that the environmental problems being faced have multiple correct solutions. Light argues that the urgency of ecological crises requires that action is necessary through negotiation and compromise. While theorists serve to further the field of environmental ethics and to debate the metaethical basis of various environmental philosophies, some answers to questions are best left to private discussion rather than taking time to argue about them publically (introduction of pragmatism). Pragmatism believes that if two theories are equally able to provide solutions to a given problem, then debate on which is more is argued that: “the commitment to solving environmental problems is the only precondition for any workable and democratic political theory” (Light, 11). While the science behind a footprint is well understood, what can the synthesis of environmental pragmatism and footprinting tell us about the moral obligation to avert climate change? How does grounding the practice of sustainability footprinting in environmental pragmatism generate moral prescriptions for averting climate change?¶ Environmental Pragmatism necessitates the need for tools in engineering to be developed and applied to avert the climate change problem, since pragmatism inherently calls for bridging the gap between theory and policy/ practices. With the theory of pragmatism in mind, further research and development of tools such as life-cycle analysis and footprinting are potential policy tools that are necessary under a pragmatist viewpoint so that informed decisions can be made by policy makers. Since the role of life-cycle analysis and footprinting attempt to improve the efficiency and decrease the overall environmental impact of a given process, good, or service, environmental pragmatism would call for the further development and usage of these tools so that we can continue to develop sustainably and fulfill our moral obligation to future generations. By utilizing footprinting and life-cycle analysis, it becomes possible to make environmentally conscious decisions not only based upon a gut instinct but additionally based on sound science. Finally, in regards to averting climate change, footprinting and life-cycle analysis offer another dimension to traditional cost-benefit analysis and can allow for our moral obligation to future generations to weigh into final decisions which will eventually result in policies and/ or a production of a good or service. Since traditional cost benefit analysis does not account for the environment explicitly, pragmatism would call for the application of these tools to ensure that the environment is adequately protected for future generations.¶ Climate change modeling inherently contains many unknowns in terms of future outcomes and applied simplifications, but these factors should not be enough to hold us back from an environmental pragmatism stand point. Rather than hiding behind a veil of uncertainty with the science, the uncertainty of the possible catastrophic outcomes demands action on the part of every human individual. Environmental pragmatism could also adopt a view point like the precautionary principle where a given action has great uncertainty, but also great consequence (Haller). Since we are attempting to protect human lives and prevent unnecessary suffering, environmental pragmatism would dictate that we should take action now and stop debating the theoretical aspects of this problem. A moral obligation exists to protect human life, and it becomes our obligation to avert climate change. Despite the relatively high economic costs of averting climate change, it is worth noting that the creation of green jobs and new sectors will help to stimulate the economy rather than completely hindering it. People inherently fear change, and it is my opinion that averting climate change requires a drastic change in our consumption patterns, an important reason why people are resisting averting climate change. From an environmental pragmatism viewpoint, it is humanities responsibility to avert climate change before it is too late since we have a moral obligation to protect the future of humanity and the biosphere.",summarize the following text: ,"Environmental pragmatism seeks to move beyond strictly theoretical exercises normal in philosophy and allow the movement to formulate substantial new policies This particular discipline advocates moral pluralism, implying that the environmental problems being faced have multiple correct solutions. Light argues that the urgency of ecological crises requires that action is necessary While theorists serve to further the field of environmental ethics and to debate the metaethical basis of various philosophies, some answers to questions are best left to private discussion rather than taking time to argue about them publically the commitment to solving environmental problems is the only precondition for any workable and democratic political theory pragmatism calls for bridging the gap between theory and policy/ practices By utilizing footprinting and life-cycle analysis, it becomes possible to make environmentally conscious decisions not only based upon a gut instinct but based on sound science Climate change modeling inherently contains many unknowns but these factors should not be enough to hold us back from an environmental pragmatism stand point.

"On the Latin American street, the Organization of American States has always borne a reputation, often undeserved, as Washington’s lackey. But the OAS, based in Washington, just sent the western hemisphere a message the White House would rather not hear: It’s time to seriously discuss legalizing marijuana as one means of reducing harrowing drug violence. That conclusion, from a study presented last Friday in Bogotá, Colombia, by OAS Secretary-General José Miguel Insulza, is one that a growing number of Latin American governments — including Uruguay, which might legalize marijuana this year — are urging the Obama Administration to accept. Having the motion seconded by Washington’s “lackey” makes it harder to ignore. But even as Insulza and Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos were hailing the OAS report last week, something else was brewing in Bogotá that could further undermine resistance to pot legalization. The Colombian capital is about to start a program that uses marijuana to wean junkies off bazuco, a cheap but fiercely addictive cocaine paste. It will mark one of the largest experiments_old to determine if marijuana — which legalization opponents still insist is a “gateway” to harder drugs like cocaine and heroin — is in reality an “exit” drug. If so, it will only serve to reinforce the argument, mentioned by the OAS study, that marijuana is a relatively benign drug, far more comparable to alcohol than it is, say, to crystal meth. (MORE: Legalizing Marijuana and Other Ways the U.S. and Mexico Can Win the Drug War) As Miami Herald South America correspondent Jim Wyss recently wrote from Bogotá, “For the most desperate [bazuco] users, the cannabis cure may be the only way out.” Or as one social worker told Wyss, “We want people to quit a substance that is very, very dama0ging and transition to something less dangerous and which will allow them to function in society.” Critics say the effort will just turn bazuco zombies into potheads. But for years now, similar projects in countries like Brazil, Jamaica and most recently Canada have indicated that marijuana is in fact an effective exit drug. In British Columbia last fall, a team of U.S. and Canadian addiction researchers determined that “clinical trials on cannabis substitution for problematic substance abuse appear justified.” That doesn’t mean we should all start smoking herb like Harold and Kumar. The fact that a glass of hot bourbon can relieve common cold symptoms doesn’t mean we should all start drinking Manhattans, either. But affirming marijuana as an exit drug would lead us to reconsider one of modern society’s most glaring double standards: booze good, pot bad. It would reinforce the notion that moderate marijuana use is not more perilous than moderate alcohol consumption. According to studies, in fact, pot smoking in some cases can be a preferable alternative to drinking alcohol and smoking tobacco. (MORE: The Obama Administration Looks to Latin America After Years of Neglect) So why do we waste so many resources (almost $10 billion each year in the U.S. alone) as well as lives hunting down marijuana users and sellers? The OAS’s $2 million report “The Drug Problem in the Americas” seems to ask the same thing. It is not an outright call for marijuana legalization. It is, as Insulza said in Bogotá, “the beginning of a long-awaited discussion” about “more realistic [drug war] policies.” Most Latin American leaders — whose countries suffer the bloody brunt of the largely failed U.S.-led drug war — already made it clear to President Obama at last year’s Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, that it’s high time to ask whether marijuana legalization might help reduce drug cartel revenues and therefore drug cartel mayhem. (Studies indicate it could rob Mexico’s narco-mafias of a third of the estimated $30 billion they rake in each year.) Insulza acknowledged the current “disposition” throughout the Americas to “deal with the legalization issue,” and he called for “greater flexibility” on the part of nations like the U.S. The 400-page OAS study itself concludes that trends in the hemisphere “lean toward decriminalization or legalization of the production, sale and use of marijuana. Sooner or later, decisions in this area will need to be taken.” Santos, who is widely considered Washington’s closest ally in Latin America today, has not yet endorsed legalization, but he said the report should help drug-war battered countries like his “seek better solutions” than the conventional interdiction strategy Washington still pushes. Former presidents of three of Latin America’s largest economies — Brazil, Mexico and Colombia — have jointly called for marijuana legalization. In the U.S., the states of Washington and Colorado last fall voted to legalize pot. Now that the OAS has joined that chorus, both the White House and the U.S. Congress need to join the discussion with more open ears.",summarize the following text: ,"the Organization of American States has always borne a reputation as Washington’s lackey But the OAS just sent the western hemisphere a message the White House would rather not hear It’s time to seriously discuss legalizing marijuana as one means of reducing harrowing drug violence That conclusion by OAS , is one that a growing number of Latin American governments which might legalize marijuana this year — are urging the Obama Administration to accept Having the motion seconded by Washington’s “lackey” makes it harder to ignore.

"In South and Central American countries there is much resistance against American policies towards Colombia. Developments in Canada in this field are also particularly interesting. Opposition against American prohibitionism has now reached proportions that can - to my mind - not much longer remain without political consequences. The important Canadian newspaper 'Ottawa Citizen' has this month published a series of thirteen articles by Dan Gardner about the failure of the 'war on drugs'. These articles were serialized in local newspapers all over Canada. Dan Gardner refers to Netherlands' policies with approval and respect, like, for that matter, is the case in most serious publications on this subject. Gardner gives a cool and clear description of the terrible damages caused by the war on drugs. Many Canadians have now for the first time read about the racist effects of this war. Prisons are populated by unimaginable numbers of blacks and latinos, who would not have to go to prison if drugs were not illegal. The 'inner circle' of the drugwarriors must by now have serious worries about its future. These developments are probably the reason why the U.S. - who no doubt would prefer to leave it to European countries to criticize the drug policies of its loyal ally Holland - started, in the last two years, to launch violent attacks themselves against the Dutch, via their highest drugs-official ex-general McCaffrey and via the DEA, both through the U.S. embassy in The Hague and from Washington. What is Bill Kok going to say to Bill Clinton today? Suppose he had three minutes time for this item on the agenda of the talks. I do not expect him to do it, but what he should of course say is something like this: ""Dear Bill, drug prohibition may have been initiated with good intentions, but it has degenerated into a policy that is damaging to public health, leading to racial discrimination and fomenting corruption. If there is one area where lies dominate the political scene it must be in drug policy. Take the expression 'fighting drugs'. What is called 'fighting drugs' is in reality straightforward promotion of unsafe forms of drug use and of the illegal drugs trade"". What Kok should also say: ""In many countries complaints become loud that rational developments in drug policy can not be implemented, because this is supposed to be contrary to the UN drug conventions, which prohibit such action. Yet the experience gained with the existence of 'coffeeshops' in the Netherlands as well as developments in cannabis use show clearly, that some basic suppositions underlying drug prohibition are wrong. We, in Holland, with our liberal policies do not have more, but fewer addicts, as our former minister of foreign affairs Van Mierlo - in his capacity as vice prime minister, so also in my name - stated clearly in his address to the UNGASS, the UN drug-summit in 1998 in New York. But we never hear you about such facts!"" ""Would that be because our data indicate that we need not worry so much about what would happen after legalization? Anyhow, you do attack us ever more fiercely about production of XTC in the Netherlands. As if the drug trade can be blamed exclusively on the country where production takes place. The truth is really very simple. As long as there is a strong demand for drugs, there will be production and criminalization will only make the trade more lucrative. It does not matter whether drugs come from one country or another. The point is that they should never have been made illegal."" And then Wim Kok could sum up with the following remarks: ""My criticism of your American approach is not just coming from my country, but can be heard - if you want to listen - in many capitals. An example: just as during the Vietnam war, resistance to your policies is now growing in countries like Canada. Have you taken note of the articles published this month in the 'Ottawa Citizen'?

Use and abuse of drugs will increase only marginally, or even decrease.

"To ensure that the Republicans control both the House and the Senate this November, the Koch brothers have spent at least $30 million over the past nine months to try and topple vulnerable House and Senate Democrats.¶ If they succeed, it would mark doom for Barack Obama's final two years in office, and potentially scupper any of the president's second-term green agenda.¶ The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity advocacy group has not indicated how much it will spend this year. But, according to the Financial Times, money into such groups is currently running at about three times the rate of the 2012 presidential elections, and 17 times that of the 2010 midterms.¶ And, the Center of Responsive Politics says that these groups might spend more than $1 billion this year.¶ The Koch's congressional campaign comes as they try to torpedo Obama's upcoming restrictions for power plant emissions by entangling them with several lawsuits.¶ Scheduled for release next month, the new rules mark's the president's signature piece of climate legislation: power plants account for most of the country's carbon pollution.¶ The news comes one year after the Kochs spent millions of dollars on setting up quasi think tanks to deny the science behind climate change.¶ In a bid to confuse the public, such misinformation campaigns are designed to keep the debate about global warming alive so that legislation on the matter does not pass. It's the same tactic that Big Tobacco used in the eighties to deny the link between smoking and cancer.¶ ""The Kochs' bid for a hostile takeover of the American democracy is calculated to make themselves even richer,"" says Senate majority leader Harry Reid. His comments came after he endorsed amending the constitution to restrict ""unlimited campaign spending.""¶ In a bid to fight back, Steyer has set up his own super PAC to run a series of attack ads revealing the Koch brothers' shady ties to such obstructive campaigns. Unlike the Koch's who are gunning for a Republican Senate win, Steyer is only backing politicians with climate aspirations.¶ But, the $100 million that he has pledged to spend is but a fraction of what the Koch brothers have in their vast war chest.¶ In the end, the battle may just boil down to a handful of crucial seats that the Democrats must hold onto if they want to maintain control of the Senate.¶ Although Steyer may have less money to play with, Mother Nature may step in to lend a helping hand: El Niño is expected to arrive this summer.¶ The weather phenomenon ushers in unusually warm water temperatures across the Pacific, ultimately warming up the atmosphere. Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research describes it as a ""mini"" global warming event.¶ The opposite happens during el Nina, it's colder sister.¶ According to recent models, there is a 75 percent chance of El Niño arriving before the midterms, and Trenberth says that this could make 2015 the hottest year on record.¶ This could have a radical impact on public attitudes towards global warming.¶ According to Jon Krosnick from Stanford University, one third of Americans do not trust climate scientists. They base their opinion on the actual weather: In warmer than usual years, their belief in climate change thus rises.¶ As El Niño unleashes a string of extreme weather that accompanies hotter weather, it could reenergize Steyer's campaign against the Kochs who may not be able to account for events which may include torrential downpours and floods across the southern part of America.¶ It could also push climate change onto the center stage for the 2016 presidential elections: El Niño tends to be accompanied by a sustained period of warming.¶ This could leave Republicans with a public relations disaster if Senator Marco Rubio ends up being their frontrunner. He recently denied the link between human activity and the warming of our planet.¶ According to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, most Republicans with political aspirations are forced to deny the science behind climate change otherwise they will not receive enough money to run:¶ They will face primary opponents financed by the Koch Brothers, and others who are part of their group, if they even breathe the slightest breath of sympathy for the truth about climate science. It's not that complicated.¶ Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist, says catastrophic events will eventually soften the GOP's position on climate change. And, without such a change, legislation will not pass in Congress.¶ Challenging the Koch brothers to a climate duel last month, Steyer said:¶ Democracy isn't served by underhanded attacks and the voice of the American people shouldn't be drowned out by anonymous voices with expensive megaphones. Which is why today I am issuing a formal invitation to Charles and David Koch to come out of the shadows and join me in exactly what they've requested: a free and open debate.

"Central to the arguments for the conceptual innovation of environmental or ecological security41 is its mobilization potential. As Buzan points out, the concept of national security ""has an enormous power as an instrument of social and political mobilization"" and, therefore, ""the obvious reason for putting environmental issues into the security agenda is the possible magni tude of the threats posed, and the need to mobilize urgent and unprece dented responses to them. The security label is a useful way both of sig nalling danger and setting priority, and for this reason alone it is likely to per sist in the environmental debates.""42 Several analysts have, however, warned against securitization of the environmental issue for some of these very rea sons, and some of the arguments I present here fit into the principled issue of securitization/desecuritization as discussed earlier in this chapter. A first argument against the environment as a security issue, mentioned, for exam ple, by Buzan, is that environmental threats are generally unintentional.43 This, by itself, does not make the threats any less serious, although it does take them out of the realm of will. As I pointed out earlier, the field of secu rity is constituted around relationships between wills: It has been, conventionally, about the efforts of one will to (allegedly) override the sovereignty of another, forcing or tempting the latter not to assert its will in defense of its sovereignty. The contest of concern, in other words, is among strategic actors imbued with intentionality, and this has been the logic around which the whole issue of security has been framed. In light of my earlier discussion, in which I stressed that ""security"" is not a reflection of our everyday sense of the word but, rather, a specific field with traditions, the jump to environ­mental security becomes much larger than might appear at first to be the case. I do not present this as an argument against the concept but, rather, as a way of illuminating or even explaining the debate over it. Second in his critique of the notion of environmental security, Richard Moss points out that the concept of ""security"" tends to imply that defense from the problem is to be provided by the state: The most serious consequence of thinking of global change and other environmental problems as threats to security is that the sorts of centralized governmental responses by powerful and autonomous state organizations that are appropriate for security threats are inappropriate for addressing most environmental problems. When one is reacting to the threat of organized external violence, military and intelligence institutions are empowered to take the measures required to repel the threat. By this same logic, when responding to environmental threats, response by centralized regulatory agencies would seem to be logical. Unfortunately, in most cases this sort of response is not the most efficient or effective way of addressing environ mental problems, particularly those that have a global character.44 Moss goes on to warn that ""the instinct for centralized state responses to security threats is highly inappropriate for responding effectively to glob al environmental problems.""45 It might, he points out, even lead to militarization of environmental problems .46 A third warning, not unrelated to the previous two, is the tendency for the concept of security to produce thinking in terms of us-them, which could then be captured by the logic of nationalism. Dan Deudney writes that ""the 'nation' is not an empty vessel or blank slate waiting to be filled or scripted, but is instead profoundly linked to war and 'us vs. them' thinking ( . . . ) Of course, taking the war and 'us vs. them' thinking out of national ism is a noble goal. But this may be like taking sex out of 'rock and roll,' a project whose feasibility declines when one remembers that 'rock and roll' was originally coined as a euphemism for sex.""47 The tendency toward ""us vs. them"" thinking, and the general tradition of viewing threats as coming from outside a state's own borders, are, in this instance, also likely to direct attention away from one's own contributions to environmental problems."" Finally, there is the more political warning that the concept of security is basically defensive in nature, a status quo concept defending that which is, even though it does not necessarily deserve to be protected. In a paradoxical way, this politically conservative bias has also led to warnings by some that the concept of environmental security could become a dangerous tool of the ""totalitarian left,"" which might attempt to relaunch itself on the basis of environmental collectivism."" Certainly, there is some risk that the logic of ecology, with its religious potentials and references to holistic categories, survival and the linked significance of everything, might easily lend itself to totalitarian projects, where also the science of ecology has focused largely on how to constrain, limit, and control activities in the name of the environment.",summarize the following text: ,"environmental security is its mobilization potential the obvious reason for putting environmental issues into the security agenda is the possible magni tude of the threats posed, and the need to mobilize urgent and unprece dented responses to them.

"I think that we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest. In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof. This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis. In this sense, the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony. This is true in general, but it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished. It is a fortiori true of whatever is called ‘the West,’ of which the US has for about a century represented the vanguard. Lacking hegemony, the sheer drive for domination has to show its true face, its raw violence. The usual, traditional ideological justifications for dominance (such as bringing democracy and freedom here and there) have now become very weak because of the contempt that the dominant nations (the US and its most powerful allies) regularly show toward legality, morality, and humanity. Of course, the so-called rogue states, thriving on corruption, do not fare any better in this sense, but for them, when they act autonomously and against the dictates of ‘the West,’ the specter of punishment, in the form of retaliatory war or even indictment from the International Criminal Court, remains a clear limit, a possibility. Not so for the dominant nations: who will stop the United States from striking anywhere at will, or Israel from regularly massacring people in the Gaza Strip, or envious France from once again trying its luck in Africa? Yet, though still dominant, these nations are painfully aware of their structural, ontological and historical, weakness. All attempts at concealing that weakness (and the uncomfortable awareness of it) only heighten the brutality in the exertion of what remains of their dominance. Although they rely on a highly sophisticated military machine (the technology of drones is a clear instance of this) and on an equally sophisticated diplomacy, which has traditionally been and increasingly is an outpost for military operations and global policing (now excellently incarnated by Africom), they know that they have lost their hegemony.¶ ‘Domination without hegemony’ is a phrase that Giovanni Arrighi uses in his study of the long twentieth century and his lineages of the twenty-first century (1994/2010 and 2007). Originating with Ranajit Guha (1992), the phrase captures the singularity of the global crisis, the terminal stage of sovereignty, in Arrighi’s “historical investigation of the present and of the future” (1994/2010: 221). It acquires particular meaning in the light of Arrighi’s notion of the bifurcation of financial and military power. Without getting into the question, treated by Arrighi, of the rise of China and East Asia, what I want to note is that for Arrighi, early in the twenty-first century, and certainly with the ill-advised and catastrophic war against Iraq, “the US belle époque came to an end and US world hegemony entered what in all likelihood is its terminal crisis.” He continues:¶ Although the United States remains by far the world’s most powerful state, its relationship to the rest of the world is now best described as one of ‘domination without hegemony’ (1994/2010: 384). What can the US do next? Not much, short of brutal dominance. In the last few years, we have seen president Obama praising himself for the killing of Osama bin Laden. While that action was most likely unlawful, too (Noam Chomsky has often noted that bin Laden was a suspect, not someone charged with or found guilty of a crime), it is certain that you can kill all the bin Ladens of the world without gaining back a bit of hegemony. In fact, this killing, just like G. W. Bush’s war against Iraq, makes one think of a Mafia-style regolamento di conti more than any other thing. Barack Obama is less forthcoming about the killing of 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, whose fate many have correctly compared to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (killed in Florida by a self-appointed security watchman), but it is precisely in cases like this one that the weakness at the heart of empire, the ill-concealed and uncontrolled fury for the loss of hegemony, becomes visible.

"In South and Central American countries there is much resistance against American policies towards Colombia. Developments in Canada in this field are also particularly interesting. Opposition against American prohibitionism has now reached proportions that can - to my mind - not much longer remain without political consequences. The important Canadian newspaper 'Ottawa Citizen' has this month published a series of thirteen articles by Dan Gardner about the failure of the 'war on drugs'. These articles were serialized in local newspapers all over Canada. Dan Gardner refers to Netherlands' policies with approval and respect, like, for that matter, is the case in most serious publications on this subject. Gardner gives a cool and clear description of the terrible damages caused by the war on drugs. Many Canadians have now for the first time read about the racist effects of this war. Prisons are populated by unimaginable numbers of blacks and latinos, who would not have to go to prison if drugs were not illegal. The 'inner circle' of the drugwarriors must by now have serious worries about its future. These developments are probably the reason why the U.S. - who no doubt would prefer to leave it to European countries to criticize the drug policies of its loyal ally Holland - started, in the last two years, to launch violent attacks themselves against the Dutch, via their highest drugs-official ex-general McCaffrey and via the DEA, both through the U.S. embassy in The Hague and from Washington. What is Bill Kok going to say to Bill Clinton today? Suppose he had three minutes time for this item on the agenda of the talks. I do not expect him to do it, but what he should of course say is something like this: ""Dear Bill, drug prohibition may have been initiated with good intentions, but it has degenerated into a policy that is damaging to public health, leading to racial discrimination and fomenting corruption. If there is one area where lies dominate the political scene it must be in drug policy. Take the expression 'fighting drugs'. What is called 'fighting drugs' is in reality straightforward promotion of unsafe forms of drug use and of the illegal drugs trade"". What Kok should also say: ""In many countries complaints become loud that rational developments in drug policy can not be implemented, because this is supposed to be contrary to the UN drug conventions, which prohibit such action. Yet the experience gained with the existence of 'coffeeshops' in the Netherlands as well as developments in cannabis use show clearly, that some basic suppositions underlying drug prohibition are wrong. We, in Holland, with our liberal policies do not have more, but fewer addicts, as our former minister of foreign affairs Van Mierlo - in his capacity as vice prime minister, so also in my name - stated clearly in his address to the UNGASS, the UN drug-summit in 1998 in New York. But we never hear you about such facts!"" ""Would that be because our data indicate that we need not worry so much about what would happen after legalization? Anyhow, you do attack us ever more fiercely about production of XTC in the Netherlands. As if the drug trade can be blamed exclusively on the country where production takes place. The truth is really very simple. As long as there is a strong demand for drugs, there will be production and criminalization will only make the trade more lucrative. It does not matter whether drugs come from one country or another. The point is that they should never have been made illegal."" And then Wim Kok could sum up with the following remarks: ""My criticism of your American approach is not just coming from my country, but can be heard - if you want to listen - in many capitals. An example: just as during the Vietnam war, resistance to your policies is now growing in countries like Canada. Have you taken note of the articles published this month in the 'Ottawa Citizen'? That paper draws a devastating picture of American drug policy. If your advisors have not drawn your attention to these articles by Dan Gardner, I would suggest you fire them immediately."" ""Of course there is not just one way of dealing with the drugs issue, only one way to regulate this market. My advisors tell me it is not difficult to conceive various systems, all of them better than the present situation of leaving organization of this market to criminal forces. ‘Legalization' is sometimes used as an invective here, but in reality legalization means 'Regulation of the Drug Market by Responsible Government'. Use and abuse of drugs will increase only marginally, or even decrease. Just like now, mainly cultural trends and social developments will determine preferences for specific substances and levels of use. Governmental policies can only marginally influence these trends and preferences and should concentrate on the promotion of responsible, controlled use and on limitation of the risks involved.""",summarize the following text: ,"Prisons are populated by unimaginable numbers of blacks and latinos, who would not have to go to prison if drugs were not illegal drug prohibition may have been initiated with good intentions, but it has degenerated into a policy that is damaging to public health, leading to racial discrimination and fomenting corruption If there is one area where lies dominate the political scene it must be in drug policy.

"I think that we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest. In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof. This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis. In this sense, the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony. This is true in general, but it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished. It is a fortiori true of whatever is called ‘the West,’ of which the US has for about a century represented the vanguard. Lacking hegemony, the sheer drive for domination has to show its true face, its raw violence. The usual, traditional ideological justifications for dominance (such as bringing democracy and freedom here and there) have now become very weak because of the contempt that the dominant nations (the US and its most powerful allies) regularly show toward legality, morality, and humanity. Of course, the so-called rogue states, thriving on corruption, do not fare any better in this sense, but for them, when they act autonomously and against the dictates of ‘the West,’ the specter of punishment, in the form of retaliatory war or even indictment from the International Criminal Court, remains a clear limit, a possibility. Not so for the dominant nations: who will stop the United States from striking anywhere at will, or Israel from regularly massacring people in the Gaza Strip, or envious France from once again trying its luck in Africa? Yet, though still dominant, these nations are painfully aware of their structural, ontological and historical, weakness. All attempts at concealing that weakness (and the uncomfortable awareness of it) only heighten the brutality in the exertion of what remains of their dominance. Although they rely on a highly sophisticated military machine (the technology of drones is a clear instance of this) and on an equally sophisticated diplomacy, which has traditionally been and increasingly is an outpost for military operations and global policing (now excellently incarnated by Africom), they know that they have lost their hegemony.¶ ‘Domination without hegemony’ is a phrase that Giovanni Arrighi uses in his study of the long twentieth century and his lineages of the twenty-first century (1994/2010 and 2007). Originating with Ranajit Guha (1992), the phrase captures the singularity of the global crisis, the terminal stage of sovereignty, in Arrighi’s “historical investigation of the present and of the future” (1994/2010: 221). It acquires particular meaning in the light of Arrighi’s notion of the bifurcation of financial and military power. Without getting into the question, treated by Arrighi, of the rise of China and East Asia, what I want to note is that for Arrighi, early in the twenty-first century, and certainly with the ill-advised and catastrophic war against Iraq, “the US belle époque came to an end and US world hegemony entered what in all likelihood is its terminal crisis.” He continues:¶ Although the United States remains by far the world’s most powerful state, its relationship to the rest of the world is now best described as one of ‘domination without hegemony’ (1994/2010: 384).

"To ensure that the Republicans control both the House and the Senate this November, the Koch brothers have spent at least $30 million over the past nine months to try and topple vulnerable House and Senate Democrats.¶ If they succeed, it would mark doom for Barack Obama's final two years in office, and potentially scupper any of the president's second-term green agenda.¶ The Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity advocacy group has not indicated how much it will spend this year. But, according to the Financial Times, money into such groups is currently running at about three times the rate of the 2012 presidential elections, and 17 times that of the 2010 midterms.¶ And, the Center of Responsive Politics says that these groups might spend more than $1 billion this year.¶ The Koch's congressional campaign comes as they try to torpedo Obama's upcoming restrictions for power plant emissions by entangling them with several lawsuits.¶ Scheduled for release next month, the new rules mark's the president's signature piece of climate legislation: power plants account for most of the country's carbon pollution.¶ The news comes one year after the Kochs spent millions of dollars on setting up quasi think tanks to deny the science behind climate change.¶ In a bid to confuse the public, such misinformation campaigns are designed to keep the debate about global warming alive so that legislation on the matter does not pass. It's the same tactic that Big Tobacco used in the eighties to deny the link between smoking and cancer.¶ ""The Kochs' bid for a hostile takeover of the American democracy is calculated to make themselves even richer,"" says Senate majority leader Harry Reid. His comments came after he endorsed amending the constitution to restrict ""unlimited campaign spending.""¶ In a bid to fight back, Steyer has set up his own super PAC to run a series of attack ads revealing the Koch brothers' shady ties to such obstructive campaigns. Unlike the Koch's who are gunning for a Republican Senate win, Steyer is only backing politicians with climate aspirations.¶ But, the $100 million that he has pledged to spend is but a fraction of what the Koch brothers have in their vast war chest.¶ In the end, the battle may just boil down to a handful of crucial seats that the Democrats must hold onto if they want to maintain control of the Senate.¶ Although Steyer may have less money to play with, Mother Nature may step in to lend a helping hand: El Niño is expected to arrive this summer.¶ The weather phenomenon ushers in unusually warm water temperatures across the Pacific, ultimately warming up the atmosphere. Kevin Trenberth, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research describes it as a ""mini"" global warming event.¶ The opposite happens during el Nina, it's colder sister.¶ According to recent models, there is a 75 percent chance of El Niño arriving before the midterms, and Trenberth says that this could make 2015 the hottest year on record.¶ This could have a radical impact on public attitudes towards global warming.¶ According to Jon Krosnick from Stanford University, one third of Americans do not trust climate scientists. They base their opinion on the actual weather: In warmer than usual years, their belief in climate change thus rises.¶ As El Niño unleashes a string of extreme weather that accompanies hotter weather, it could reenergize Steyer's campaign against the Kochs who may not be able to account for events which may include torrential downpours and floods across the southern part of America.¶ It could also push climate change onto the center stage for the 2016 presidential elections: El Niño tends to be accompanied by a sustained period of warming.¶ This could leave Republicans with a public relations disaster if Senator Marco Rubio ends up being their frontrunner. He recently denied the link between human activity and the warming of our planet.¶ According to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, most Republicans with political aspirations are forced to deny the science behind climate change otherwise they will not receive enough money to run:¶ They will face primary opponents financed by the Koch Brothers, and others who are part of their group, if they even breathe the slightest breath of sympathy for the truth about climate science. It's not that complicated.¶ Mark McKinnon, a Republican strategist, says catastrophic events will eventually soften the GOP's position on climate change. And, without such a change, legislation will not pass in Congress.¶ Challenging the Koch brothers to a climate duel last month, Steyer said:¶ Democracy isn't served by underhanded attacks and the voice of the American people shouldn't be drowned out by anonymous voices with expensive megaphones. Which is why today I am issuing a formal invitation to Charles and David Koch to come out of the shadows and join me in exactly what they've requested: a free and open debate.

"I think that we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest. In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof. This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis. In this sense, the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony. This is true in general, but it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished. It is a fortiori true of whatever is called ‘the West,’ of which the US has for about a century represented the vanguard. Lacking hegemony, the sheer drive for domination has to show its true face, its raw violence. The usual, traditional ideological justifications for dominance (such as bringing democracy and freedom here and there) have now become very weak because of the contempt that the dominant nations (the US and its most powerful allies) regularly show toward legality, morality, and humanity. Of course, the so-called rogue states, thriving on corruption, do not fare any better in this sense, but for them, when they act autonomously and against the dictates of ‘the West,’ the specter of punishment, in the form of retaliatory war or even indictment from the International Criminal Court, remains a clear limit, a possibility. Not so for the dominant nations: who will stop the United States from striking anywhere at will, or Israel from regularly massacring people in the Gaza Strip, or envious France from once again trying its luck in Africa? Yet, though still dominant, these nations are painfully aware of their structural, ontological and historical, weakness. All attempts at concealing that weakness (and the uncomfortable awareness of it) only heighten the brutality in the exertion of what remains of their dominance. Although they rely on a highly sophisticated military machine (the technology of drones is a clear instance of this) and on an equally sophisticated diplomacy, which has traditionally been and increasingly is an outpost for military operations and global policing (now excellently incarnated by Africom), they know that they have lost their hegemony.¶ ‘Domination without hegemony’ is a phrase that Giovanni Arrighi uses in his study of the long twentieth century and his lineages of the twenty-first century (1994/2010 and 2007). Originating with Ranajit Guha (1992), the phrase captures the singularity of the global crisis, the terminal stage of sovereignty, in Arrighi’s “historical investigation of the present and of the future” (1994/2010: 221). It acquires particular meaning in the light of Arrighi’s notion of the bifurcation of financial and military power. Without getting into the question, treated by Arrighi, of the rise of China and East Asia, what I want to note is that for Arrighi, early in the twenty-first century, and certainly with the ill-advised and catastrophic war against Iraq, “the US belle époque came to an end and US world hegemony entered what in all likelihood is its terminal crisis.” He continues:¶ Although the United States remains by far the world’s most powerful state, its relationship to the rest of the world is now best described as one of ‘domination without hegemony’ (1994/2010: 384). What can the US do next? Not much, short of brutal dominance. In the last few years, we have seen president Obama praising himself for the killing of Osama bin Laden. While that action was most likely unlawful, too (Noam Chomsky has often noted that bin Laden was a suspect, not someone charged with or found guilty of a crime), it is certain that you can kill all the bin Ladens of the world without gaining back a bit of hegemony. In fact, this killing, just like G. W. Bush’s war against Iraq, makes one think of a Mafia-style regolamento di conti more than any other thing. Barack Obama is less forthcoming about the killing of 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, whose fate many have correctly compared to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (killed in Florida by a self-appointed security watchman), but it is precisely in cases like this one that the weakness at the heart of empire, the ill-concealed and uncontrolled fury for the loss of hegemony, becomes visible. The frenzy denies the possibility of power as care, which is what should replace hegemony, let alone domination. Nor am I sure I share Arrighi’s optimistic view about the possible rise of a new hegemonic center of power in East Asia and China: probably that would only be a shift in the axis of uncaring power, unable to affect, let alone exit, the paradigm of sovereignty and violence.

"In South and Central American countries there is much resistance against American policies towards Colombia. Developments in Canada in this field are also particularly interesting. Opposition against American prohibitionism has now reached proportions that can - to my mind - not much longer remain without political consequences. The important Canadian newspaper 'Ottawa Citizen' has this month published a series of thirteen articles by Dan Gardner about the failure of the 'war on drugs'. These articles were serialized in local newspapers all over Canada. Dan Gardner refers to Netherlands' policies with approval and respect, like, for that matter, is the case in most serious publications on this subject. Gardner gives a cool and clear description of the terrible damages caused by the war on drugs. Many Canadians have now for the first time read about the racist effects of this war. Prisons are populated by unimaginable numbers of blacks and latinos, who would not have to go to prison if drugs were not illegal. The 'inner circle' of the drugwarriors must by now have serious worries about its future. These developments are probably the reason why the U.S. - who no doubt would prefer to leave it to European countries to criticize the drug policies of its loyal ally Holland - started, in the last two years, to launch violent attacks themselves against the Dutch, via their highest drugs-official ex-general McCaffrey and via the DEA, both through the U.S. embassy in The Hague and from Washington. What is Bill Kok going to say to Bill Clinton today? Suppose he had three minutes time for this item on the agenda of the talks. I do not expect him to do it, but what he should of course say is something like this: ""Dear Bill, drug prohibition may have been initiated with good intentions, but it has degenerated into a policy that is damaging to public health, leading to racial discrimination and fomenting corruption. If there is one area where lies dominate the political scene it must be in drug policy. Take the expression 'fighting drugs'. What is called 'fighting drugs' is in reality straightforward promotion of unsafe forms of drug use and of the illegal drugs trade"". What Kok should also say: ""In many countries complaints become loud that rational developments in drug policy can not be implemented, because this is supposed to be contrary to the UN drug conventions, which prohibit such action. Yet the experience gained with the existence of 'coffeeshops' in the Netherlands as well as developments in cannabis use show clearly, that some basic suppositions underlying drug prohibition are wrong. We, in Holland, with our liberal policies do not have more, but fewer addicts, as our former minister of foreign affairs Van Mierlo - in his capacity as vice prime minister, so also in my name - stated clearly in his address to the UNGASS, the UN drug-summit in 1998 in New York. But we never hear you about such facts!"" ""Would that be because our data indicate that we need not worry so much about what would happen after legalization? Anyhow, you do attack us ever more fiercely about production of XTC in the Netherlands. As if the drug trade can be blamed exclusively on the country where production takes place. The truth is really very simple. As long as there is a strong demand for drugs, there will be production and criminalization will only make the trade more lucrative. It does not matter whether drugs come from one country or another. The point is that they should never have been made illegal."" And then Wim Kok could sum up with the following remarks: ""My criticism of your American approach is not just coming from my country, but can be heard - if you want to listen - in many capitals. An example: just as during the Vietnam war, resistance to your policies is now growing in countries like Canada. Have you taken note of the articles published this month in the 'Ottawa Citizen'? That paper draws a devastating picture of American drug policy. If your advisors have not drawn your attention to these articles by Dan Gardner, I would suggest you fire them immediately."" ""Of course there is not just one way of dealing with the drugs issue, only one way to regulate this market. My advisors tell me it is not difficult to conceive various systems, all of them better than the present situation of leaving organization of this market to criminal forces. ‘Legalization' is sometimes used as an invective here, but in reality legalization means 'Regulation of the Drug Market by Responsible Government'. Use and abuse of drugs will increase only marginally, or even decrease. Just like now, mainly cultural trends and social developments will determine preferences for specific substances and levels of use. Governmental policies can only marginally influence these trends and preferences and should concentrate on the promotion of responsible, controlled use and on limitation of the risks involved.""",summarize the following text: ,"Prisons are populated by unimaginable numbers of blacks and latinos, who would not have to go to prison if drugs were not illegal drug prohibition may have been initiated with good intentions, but it has degenerated into a policy that is damaging to public health, leading to racial discrimination and fomenting corruption If there is one area where lies dominate the political scene it must be in drug policy.

"Another important essay from the 1972 collection, “Towards a Critique of the Political Economy of the Sign,” explains the political task that this semiological analysis suggests. Baudrillard had previously focused on the sign values of commodities, arguing that the commodity is a kind of sign. He now argues that the sign is also a kind of commodity, writing that “the logic of the commodity and of political economy is at the very heart of the sign”. This is implied by the formula worked out in “For a General Theory,” and Baudrillard extends the implications of the homology between the commodity and the sign to argue that semiology and structuralism – which take the Saussurean sign as their basic unit of analysis – are implicated in the system of political economy and cannot therefore function as adequate theoretical bases of critique. Moreover, the “semio-linguistic” theory of meaning, like the capitalist system of commodities, is itself reductive of the more existentially rich form of meaning implied in symbolic exchange. Baudrillard thus no longer sees semiology as a useful method of analysing capitalism, but as a model of meaning bound up with capitalism and contributing to contemporary nihilism. He therefore argues that the critique of the system of political economy must include a critique of the sign, and employs a deconstructive method inspired by Jacques Derrida to enact this critique. This deconstructive method aims at a transgression of the system of political economy which will allow the return or renewal of symbolic exchange. Baudrillard is still motivated here by a Marxian revolutionary impulse, and asserts that in this revolution “even signs must burn”. It is on this positing of symbolic exchange as a transgression of capitalist political economy that Lyotard critiques Baudrillard in Libidinal Economy. While he expresses admiration for Baudrillard’s work and calls him “brother”, he engages in a strident critique of what he sees as the latter’s nostalgia for symbolic exchange, and arguing in effect that this nostalgia is a form of religious nihilism. Lyotard argues that the Marxian dream of a society without exploitation is nothing but a phantasy or myth, having no more reality than the “true world” posited by the religious nihilist. Baudrillard’s idea of symbolic exchange, he argues, is just a further permutation of this Marxian myth. While Baudrillard attempts to ground the idea of symbolic exchange in anthropological studies of “primitive societies,” Lyotard argues that Baudrillard’s conception of such societies is unrealistically utopian. According to Lyotard, Baudrillard conceives symbolic exchange as “a give-and-take heedless of the conservation of goods”; it is a game of mutual challenge which might lead to the wasteful expenditure of goods to a point which is purely destructive. In opposition to Baudrillard, Lyotard argues that “there are no primitive societies,” by which he means that there are no societies free from the conservation and economic regulation of goods which marks the capitalist system of production. Both capitalism and “primitive societies,” Lyotard argues, require the conservation and circulation of goods, and all such circulation is equivalent to the capitalist economy of production in that it administers life according to the demands of regulation. Where Baudrillard claims that “[t[here is neither a mode of production nor production in primitive societies”, Lyotard argues that all societies are subject to similar economic regulation regardless of whether or not they use money or other, “less primitive,” forms of regulation. He explains: …the primitive society is also a capitalism….of course, savages do not capitalize goods; but who considers that it is only the fully mercantile instance of the great Zero that sanctions and indeed demands the scrupulous balancing of the inflows and outflows of affects (in the form of relatives, words, beasts, lives, sexes), hanging over and maintaining these societies? In positing the phantasy of primitive societies, Lyotard sees Baudrillard as nostalgic for a form of social exchange free from the devaluation of life by economic regulation which never really existed, and which cannot exist (at least in a pure form). In seeking to transgress the system of capitalist/semio-linguistic political economy, Baudrillard likewise stakes his hopes on the future (re)institution of a pure form of symbolic exchange which is again an empty phantasy. Lyotard sees both nostalgia and transgression as marks of religious nihilism, akin to positing a paradisiacal innocence from which Mankind has fallen and a future redemption in a transcendent “true world.” The realm of symbolic exchange acts as a lost object which we must transgress the sphere of political economy to regain, and holds the same logical position as all the transcendent, suprasensible categories in Nietzsche’s analysis of religious nihilism.",summarize the following text: ,"Baudrillard is still motivated by a Marxian revolutionary impulse Lyotard critiques Baudrillard he sees the latter’s nostalgia for symbolic exchange this nostalgia is a form of religious nihilism the Marxian dream of a society without exploitation is nothing but a phantasy having no more reality than the “true world” posited by the religious nihilist.

"The French word ressentiment, from which the English resentment was derived, commonly denotes a state of vengeful rancor produced as an effect of an injurious encounter. The word resent conjugates the prefix re-, which designates both repetition and backward motion, with sent, which comes from the Latin verb sentire, ""to feel."" Thus ressentiment pertains to reactive feelings repeatedly felt and designates a psychological state that is always and only relational: resentment is always the product of ""interaction"" between injured forces and injuring forces (from the harmful actions of a tyrannical person the more general condition of human suffering), and it always produces in turn a reactive desire on the part of the injured to exact retribution from the injuring (their assailant, ""life""). As Anna Yeatrnan notes, ressentiment ""makes sense to a subject who is systematically brutalized and exploited by more powerful forces."" Ressentiment is an economy of negative affect rather than an affect in itself: it is a configuration of emotions wherein pain is constantly remembered and revisited, and in which hatred and the desire for revenge are constantly renewed. What is most important for our purposes is the point at which ressentiment becomes ""creative"": that is, the point at which it becomes a ""condition of possibility"" and ceases to be simply a ""condition.""¶ Ressentiment gives birth to morals at the same time that it comes to serve as a means of identity formation, and on the plane of the political the concept can be used to discern the process through which negative and nontransformative political identities are achieved. The feeling of powerlessness and the experience of suffering are always at the root of ressentiment —whether incurred as a result of a loss of power (the noble forced to slavery) or a perpetual state of powerlessness (the ""original"" slave). In the case of feminism, the ""danger"" of ressentiment presents itself with the desire to counter the forces that have caused women's oppression historically. Ressentiment feminism can be understood, to use Yeatman's term, as a ""reactive project of survival."" As such, this feminism forms its political identity in accordance with the tactic of inversion, and its opposition to the sociocultural configurations that have proved injurious to women is motivated by the will to reverse these configurations. This reversal occurs, at an imagined or discursive level— which is not to say that it does not have ""real"" effects—at the birth of feminist morals or, more specifically, when this feminism comes to equate women's powerlessness with women's goodness. As Yeatman describes, echoing the concerns of the popular press feminists dealt with above, ""Such a feminism is committed to discovering what is good in women's distinctive ways of relating and doing things [and] ends up celebrating as virtues all those aspects of the identity of the oppressed which are associated with strategic self-preservation in a condition of weakness.” Similarly, Brown comments that this feminism maneuvers toward attaining ""singular purchase on 'the good.'""¶ For this feminism, patriarchy assumes the appearance of a system that enjoys the privilege of unhindered activity: patriarchy is a ""force which does not separate itself from its effect or its manifestations."" This feminism will attempt to forge such a separation by casting the activity of patriarchy as the blameworthy cause of injury, as a force that must be separated from its manifestations (the doer posited beyond the deed) and made accountable for its effects. With the introduction of accountability through accusation, this feminism casts itself and its constituency as the deserving creditors. However, the less obvious companion of this credit claim is an investment in, or indebtedness to, the power relationship from which it is elaborated. Nietzsche notes that the creature of ressentiment ""requires a hostile world in order to exist"": here this means that the evils of patriarchy buttress this feminism's moral identity and serve as a necessary resource for its ""survival"" (GM I:io). In this sense, this feminism is indebted to the configuration of power against which it is situated, an indebtedness that has two effects: for Yeatman, it 'preserv[es] the identity of the oppressed subject""; for Brown, it ""inadvertently redraw[s] the very configurations and effects of power that [it] seek[s] to vanquish.” As with the previous set of writers I discussed, Brown, Yeatman, and Tapper share the concern that the politics of ressentiment leads feminists to position themselves ""politically"" in a morally superior realm outside of power. In this realm—the margins, the bottom of the hierarchy—participating in power is admonished as an unfeminist act that is equated with ""undemocratic domination."" One of the primary points found in each of their critiques is that this realm is no less implicated in a will to power and no less prone to the desire to dominate than is the center, the top of the hierarchy.",summarize the following text: ,"ressentiment is always the product of ""interaction"" between injured forces and injuring forces and it produces a reactive desire to exact retribution ressentiment ""makes sense to a subject who is systematically brutalized and exploited Ressentiment is an economy of negative affect rather than an affect in itself: it is a configuration of emotions wherein pain is constantly remembered and desire for revenge are constantly renewed Ressentiment feminism forms its identity with the tactic of inversion, and its opposition to at the birth of feminist morals when this feminism comes to equate women's powerlessness with women's goodness This feminism will attempt to forge a separation by casting patriarchy as the blameworthy cause of injury, as a force that must be separated from its manifestations (the doer posited beyond the deed) and made accountable for its effects.

"Nancy, Professor @ UC Berkeley, “Rotten trade: millennial capitalism, human values and global justice in organs trafficking”, Journal of Human Rights, Vol. 2, No. 2, June, 197–226, AB
The 'demand' for human organs, tissues, and body parts — and the desperate search among wealthy transplant patients to purchase them — is driven, above all, by the medical discourse on scarcity. The specter of long transplant 'waiting lists' — sometimes only virtual lists with little material basis in reality I — has motivated and driven questionable practices of organ harvesting with blatant sales alongside 'compensated gifting', doctors acting as brokers, and fierce competition between public and private hospitals for patients of means. But the very idea of organ 'scarcity' is what Ivan Illich (1970) would call an artificially created need, invented by transplant technicians and dangled before the eyes of an ever- expanding sick, aging and dying population. The resulting artificially created organs scarcity is 'misrecognized' (Bourdieu 1977) as a natural medical phenomenon. In this environment of 'survivalist' utilitarian pragmatics, the ethics of transplantation is modeled after classical 'lifeboat' ethics (Koch 2001). With ethical presumptions of scarcity, there appear to be clear choices to be made, namely who gets into the lifeboat ('getting on the waiting list'); who will be shoved off the boat when it gets overcrowded (getting triaged while on the waiting list); and who will, in the end, be 'eaten' so that others may live (race and class disparities in organs procurement and distribution practices)? There is little consciousness of the vulnerability of some social classes and ethnic groups who can be described as the 'designated donor' populations, both living and brain dead. In the United States, for example, where cadaver transplant continues to be supported as the norm for donation (if not so, increasingly, in practice), the brain dead are drawn from a population that is disproportionately poor — including whites, Latinos and African- Americans. The poor and minorities are over-represented in the intensive care centers (ICUs) of large urban hospitals, due to their over-exposure to urban violence, higher rates of homicide, suicide and vehicular death, as well as the cumulative effects of societal and medical neglect. The great irony is that those lacking public insurance (44 million citizens) also comprise the greatest number of those whose family members are asked to behave altruistically and to donate the organs and tissues of loved ones. That a great many of these poor, African-American and Latino families refuse to donate should come as no surprise. They are being asked to support with the bodies of their loved ones a social and medical system that excludes them and within which they have a lower probability of receiving an organ, should that need arise. One needs to be relatively affluent and otherwise healthy and well looked after to be recommended for organ transplant. The much commented upon refusal of African-Americans to donate organs should be seen as a political act of considered resistance. As for living, paid donation, the social inequities are more transparent. Those who sell a kidney are normally from social and economic strata where access to basic medical care and necessary aftercare are most often lacking. But to date the only dissident voices raised against the dominant transplant narrative of life-saving come from far afield and are generally expressed in unpalatable forms that are all too easily dismissed and discredited. These alternative bioethical positions are often expressed 'primitively' and from the social margins in the form of rumors and moral panics of body theft and organ stealing, some of which turns out not to be so groundless after all. To a great many of those living on the fringes of the new global disorder, the scramble for 'fresh' organs and tissues increases their profound sense of ontological insecurity in a world that values their bodies as a reservoir of spare parts (Scheper-Hughes 1996). While popular resistance in Mexico and Brazil led to revoking new and progressivist laws of presumed consent for the purposes of harvesting organs, such resistance has been ineffectual or lacking with respect to the growth of the international organs market, as those on all sides of the transplant equation have began to accept as normal and routine these nonetheless still largely covert transactions protected by transplant medicine's coyly averted gaze. Throughout these radical transformations, the voice of anthropology has been muted while the high-stake debates have been waged among transplant professionals, bioethicists, legal scholars and economists. But what other human science and discipline is better suited than anthropology to interrogate values and practices from a position of epistemological openness and to offer radical alternatives to the limited pragmatic utilitarianism that dominates medical bioethical thinking today?",summarize the following text: ,"The 'demand' for human organs, tissues, and body parts is driven, by the medical discourse on scarcity The specter of long transplant 'waiting lists' only virtual lists with little material basis in reality motivated questionable practices of organ harvesting with 'compensated gifting' doctors acting as brokers the very idea of organ 'scarcity' is an artificially created need invented by transplant technicians and dangled before the eyes of an ever- expanding sick, aging and dying population The resulting artificially created organs scarcity is 'misrecognized' as a natural medical phenomenon.

"Everywhere we turn, the issues and impacts of climate change confront us. One of the most serious environmental threats facing the world today, climate change has moved from the minds of scientists and offices of environmentalists to the mainstream. Though the media is dominated by images of polar bears, melting glaciers, flooded lands, and arid desserts, there is a human face to this story as well. Climate change is not only an issue of the environment; it is also an issue of justice and human rights, one that dangerously intersects race and class. All over the world people of color, Indigenous Peoples and low-income communities bear disproportionate burdens from climate change itself, from ill-designed policies to prevent it, and from side effects of the energy systems that cause it. A Climate of Change explores the impacts of climate change on African Americans, from health to economics to community, and considers what policies would most harm or benefit African Americans—and the nation as a whole. African Americans are thirteen percent of the U.S. population and on average emit nearly twenty percent less greenhouse gases than non-Hispanic whites per capita. Though far less responsible for climate change, African Americans are significantly more vulnerable to its effects than non- Hispanic whites. Health, housing, economic well-being, culture, and social stability are harmed from such manifestations of climate change as storms, floods, and climate variability. African Americans are also more vulnerable to higher energy bills, unemployment, recessions caused by global energy price shocks, and a greater economic burden from military operations designed to protect the flow of oil to the U.S. Climate Justice: The Time Is Now Ultimately, accomplishing climate justice will require that new alliances are forged and traditional movements are transformed. An effective policy to address the challenges of global warming cannot be crafted until race and equity are part of the discussion from the outset and an integral part of the solution. This report finds that: Global warming amplifies nearly all existing inequalities. Under global warming, injustices that are already unsustainable become catastrophic. Thus it is essential to recognize that all justice is climate justice and that the struggle for racial and economic justice is an unavoidable part of the fight to halt global warming. Sound global warming policy is also economic and racial justice policy. Successfully adopting a sound global warming policy will do as much to strengthen the economies of low-income communities and communities of color as any other currently plausible stride toward economic justice. Climate policies that best serve African Americans also best serve a just and strong United States. This paper shows that policies well-designed to benefit African Americans also provide the most benefit to all people in the U.S. Climate policies that best serve African Americans and other disproportionately affected communities also best serve global economic and environmental justice. Domestic reductions in global warming pollution and support for such reductions in developing nations financed by polluter-pays principles provide the greatest benefit to African Americans, the peoples of Africa, and people across the Global South. A distinctive African American voice is critical for climate justice. Currently, legislation is being drafted, proposed, and considered without any significant input from the communities most affected. Special interests are represented by powerful lobbies, while traditional environmentalists often fail to engage people of color, Indigenous Peoples, and low-income communities until after the political playing field has been defined and limited to conventional environmental goals. A strong focus on equity is essential to the success of the environmental cause, but equity issues cannot be adequately addressed by isolating the voices of communities that are disproportionately impacted. Engagement in climate change policy must be moved from the White House and the halls of Congress to social circles, classrooms, kitchens, and congregations. The time is now for those disproportionately affected to assume leadership in the climate change debate, to speak truth to power, and to assert rights to social, environmental and economic justice. Taken together, these actions affirm a vital truth that will bring communities together: Climate Justice is Common Justice. African Americans and Vulnerability In this report, it is shown that African Americans are disproportionately affected by climate change.

"(Li Juan, THE AMERICAN CHINA THREAT MENTALITY, Master’s Thesis in Liberal Studies, March 2012, pg. 77-79)
The American China threat mentality has become an effective tool that perpetuates American exceptionalist practice in respect to U.S. relations with China and their dichotomous view of the world. It also helps shape the future trajectory of ChinaU.S. relations.¶ The American China threat mentality basically evolved from three major trends including racial nativism in the late nineteen century, McCarthyist extremism in the Cold War and the new American exceptionalism in the postColdWar era. This evolution started in the late nineteenth century when racial nativism was in full swing, cultivating the fear of the Chinese immigrants. The climax of this nativist movement was the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act. This fear and exclusion of the Chinese immediately morphed into the fear of Communism during the Cold War. McCarthyism definitely culminated in this paranoia of Communism or Chinese communism in particular. This extremist mindset and practice continued after the Cold War and was further reflected in the new American exceptionalism which supplied the American China threat mentality with the friendorfoe binary opposition and the exceptionalist norm that promoted the American political model and legitimized its transgressions of and exemptions from the rule of law. Moreover, as suggested by Galtung's oscillation model, Americans' misunderstanding of the stark realities of Chinese politics and economy from 1949 to 1958 also enhanced Americans' misperceptions of China and further contributed to this China threat mentality.¶ Grounded on the friendorfoe rationale and exceptionalist norm, the American China threat mentality not only was reflected in American public opinion of China as well as U.S.China policy, but also found its way into the discourse of American mainstream media and scholarly works. The scrutiny of the media discourse and scholarly publications concerning the four pivotal incidents in the history of ChinaU.S. relations reveals that mass media reified the American China threat mentality by virtue of using those events as a way to revive Americans' Cold War memory, criticize the Chinese government and therefore accentuate the enemy image of the Chinese government and communism.¶ In a bigger picture, the American China threat mentality followed a zigzag pattern similar to Galtung's oscillation model. This pattern featured alternating periods of the waxing and waning of the China threat mentality, corresponding to the fluctuation of American public opinion on China. To be specific, the waxing of this China threat mentality was parallel to the 9year distribution period and the waning to the 9year growth period.¶ In a similar fashion, ChinaU.S. relations showed a curvy pattern as well. From the confrontation and containment in the 1950s to the moderate improvements in the bilateral ties between the two in the 1960s, ChinaU.S. relations fluctuated widely. From the nascent opening contacts and rapprochement in 1970s to the increasing military and economic cooperation in the 1980s, the fluctuation of ChinaU.S. relations continued. From the strategic engagement in the 1990s to the widespread concerns over China's future economic trajectory and military prowess in the 2000s, ChinaU.S. relations oscillated in the same manner. With a clear sight on the similar zigzag patterns of the American China threat mentality and ChinaU.S. relations, one can predict that ChinaU.S. relations will continue to fluctuate the conceivable future.¶ With growing interdependence and interweaving economies, America can no longer operate its relations with China by virtue of the American China threat mentality and the dichotomous view of the world. It will be in the interest of our nations to seek common ground while reserving our differences. Moreover, lack of historical perspective and a completely shallow understanding of the roots of Chinese culture in Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism will only misguide America and create more problems than solve.¶ Additionally, the misperception of Americans in viewing all Communism as the same lacks the understanding that postCultural Revolution communism in China was a system that while flawed in some ways, worked for the Chinese people. Americans did not dare to admit that the communism at that time in China was actually saving a country of over 500 million people'97 from foreign oppression, domestic tyranny, constant warfare and starvation. It was Americans' imperative in post World War II to contain all of communism in the world which led to American policy seeking to ring China with a circle of strategic holdings. Another reason for America perceiving communism in the world and Chinese communism in particular as a threat was that communism was frequently linked to notables such as Stalin, and this threat of communism was a selfcreated and selffulfilling fallacy predicated on the paranoiac aspect of American politics, which will only perpetuate actual conflicts or even wars.",summarize the following text: ,"The American China threat mentality has become an effective tool that perpetuates American exceptionalist practice China threat mentality evolved from racial nativism McCarthyist extremism and American exceptionalism The climax was the Chinese Exclusion Act With growing interdependence and interweaving economies, America can no longer operate its relations with China by virtue of the American China threat mentality and the dichotomous view of the world , lack of historical perspective and a completely shallow understanding of the roots of Chinese culture will only misguide America and create more problems than solve this threat was a selfcreated and selffulfilling fallacy predicated on the paranoiac aspect of American politics, which will only perpetuate actual conflicts or even wars."

"International competition is no different. Although we all, to varying degrees, assimilate ourselves into our national groups and favor our fellow nationals over foreigners, we do not invariably pit our nations against other nations. Anti-foreignism is neither in our blood nor hardwired into our psyches. International competition is not — as Mercer (1995) suggests — the inexorable product of our identification with national groups. Fearon and Laitin’s (1996) quantitative findings on the relative non-occurrence of ethnic conflict support this argument. Assuming that competition precedes conflict, this article has focused on the transition from ingroup positivity to intergroup competition, the second and third stages of the four-stage model of the progression from ingroup identification to intergroup conflict. It has not, therefore, said much about the equally contingent transition between intergroup competition and intergroup conflict, stages three and four. Rogers Brubaker and David Laitin (1998) are right that this transition is a ‘phase shift’ — it is not a change in degree, but a change in kind demanding separate theoretical attention. I disagree with Brubaker and Laitin (1998: 438), however, when they assert that psychological theories cannot account for aggression. Just as I located comparison at the juncture between ingroup positivity and intergroup competition (stages two and three), I suggest that emotion lies at the juncture between intergroup competition and conflict (stages three and four).22 I thus join Mercer (1996) and Neta Crawford (2000) in calling for emotion to be brought back into the study of IR. The psychologies and sociologies of emotion in particular can teach us a great deal about when international competition will lead to war — and when it will not. Although a persuasive case for the pivotal role of affect in transforming competition (stage three) into violent conflict (stage four) requires separate treatment, a brief discussion of one specific emotion — anger — is warranted here to defend psychology from Brubaker and Laitin’s critique. Anger can restore status after it has been taken away unfairly. It ‘seems designed to rectify injustice’, one group of psychologists writes — ‘to reassert power or status, to frighten the offending person into compliance, to restore a desired state of affairs’ (Shaver et al., 1987: 1078). In Injustice: The Social Bases of Obedience and Revolt, Barrington Moore (1978: 17) similarly argues that ‘vengeance means retaliation. It also means a reassertion of human dignity or worth, after injury or damage. Both are basic sentiments behind moral anger and the sense of injustice.’ Where Moore highlights the emotional, J.M. Barbalet (1998: 136) stresses the instrumental — ‘Vengefulness is an emotion of power relations. It functions to correct imbalanced or disjointed power relationships. Vengefulness is concerned with restoring social actors to their rightful place in relationships.’ Anger can thus simultaneously have both symbolic and instrumental dimensions. It is such ethical anger, I suggest, that can impel sustained conflict and violence.23 Indeed, Chinese nationalists frequently speak of injustice. Xiong Lei, for instance, writes in 1997’s passionate anti-American bestseller, The Plot to Demonize China, that ‘we do not seek to foment hatred of Americans, only to restore justice’ (Li and Liu, 1996: 83). The Chinese who threw bricks at the US Embassy in Beijing after the bombing of their embassy in Belgrade in May 1999 were also impelled by an ethical anger that sought to right a wrong. They were genuinely angry — not, as Western pundits generally suggested, playthings in the hands of communist puppet masters. Chinese protesters sought retributive justice — to restore China’s proper place in international society (Gries, 2001). Righteous anger can impel intergroup competition into violent conflict. In this paper I have attempted to advance the theoretic debate over conflict in IR by bringing in agency and contingency. Nations do not act; individuals act. Like all peoples, Chinese are neither innately pacifist nor hardwired for conflict. Instead, history and culture shape how individual Chinese will construe the events of world politics. The social psychology of intergroup relations can then help explain whether they will choose cooperation or conflict in a given situation. Sino–American relations in the 21st century, therefore, will not inevitably be conflictual. Individual agency plays a vital role. It is the actions of individual Chinese and Americans — both in the street and in the corridors of power — that will determine whether our need to view our nations positively will lead to Sino–American conflict. By suggesting which conditions promote intergroup conflict and which diffuse it, social identity theory (SIT) can help us learn to live together, in peace.",summarize the following text: ,"we do not invariably pit our nations against other nations.

"This example underscores another problem with attributing China’s new assertiveness to the autonomy of the PLA—uncritically assuming that a handful of PLA pundits and commentators have influence on foreign policy. Many analysts argue that evidence for the PLA’s independent, hard-line institutional influence comes from the blog posts, op-eds, and commentary of a handful of retired, quasi-retired, and sometimes still active PLA intellectuals (e.g., Adm. Yang Yi, Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, Col. Dai Xu, Senior Col. Han Xudong, Maj. Gen. Zhang Zhaozhong, and Maj. Gen. Peng Guangqian are among the main voices). Some analysts cite these individuals as evidence of more aggressive, anti-American, or expansionist preferences within the PLA.100 Other commentators argue that these voices may be representative of the PRC leadership in that, as CCP members working within the strict hierarchy of the PLA, these individuals have no room to express their own views. Whether the public commentary from hard-line PLA voices reflects official messages from the PLA as an institutional actor, let alone the preferences of China’s top civilian leaders, is open to question.101 The reality is much more complicated. First, it is clear that political space has opened up in public commentary on Chinese foreign policy for a wider range of voices. To be sure, space is greater for more nationalistic and militaristic voices, and there appear to be no legal strictures or norms requiring these PLA voices to coordinate with government policymakers. Thus these commentators, as PLA-connected opinion-makers, ironically have more space to try to push the government in harder-line directions. Some civilian analysts in China complain that there is no norm whereby a senior political leader can publicly admonish military officers who talk out of turn. Thus in the new media environment in China, these PLA authors (especially the quasi- and fully retired ones) may sometimes represent only themselves. Second, despite this political space for hard-line views, these individuals have occasionally been criticized internally for their commentary by central authorities and have had to tone down their rhetoric to stay within certain policy boundaries. When Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan labeled ROC President Ma Yingjeou’s policy toward the PRC as “peaceful separation” in a speech in late November 2009, for instance, he was criticized internally and required to retreat from his comments.102 Other senior civilian foreign policy officials have noted that when the opinions of these PLA commentators are too inconsistent with official policy, their influence is actually diminished.103 In the second half of 2010, Hu Jintao reportedly issued orders for PLA commentators to exercise more self-restraint.104 Third, PLA commentators are less in agreement than meets the eye. Col. Dai Xu’s xenophobia or Senior Col. Liu Mingfu’s advocacy of Chinese hegemonism are not shared by other high-profile officers such as Adm. Yang Yi or Senior Col. Han Xudong.105 Dai Xu’s claim that instability on the Korean Peninsula is entirely a function of the United States provoking the DPRK in hopes of triggering a crisis is inconsistent with an Academy of Military Science study that acknowledges the unpredictability and belligerence of the DPRK regime.106 Liu Mingfu’s argument that China can and should strive to replace the United States as the leading global power has been criticized by Adm. Yin Zhuo and Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, who believe that his projections are unrealistic.107 Yet Adm. Yin Zhuo and Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan have disagreed over the degree to which China should use overt military power to resolve its maritime disputes.108 There is often no particular coherence to some of the views held by some PLA commentators, so it is doubtful the public expression of these views is well coordinated. Finally, in some cases these commentators are not in any position to know much about foreign policy decisionmaking, let alone to influence it. Some of the PLA commentators, for instance, come from propaganda and political work backgrounds; their main responsibilities or training have been in political mobilization, morale, and CCP control of the PLA. Dai Xu, Liu Mingfu, as well as Qiao Liang and Wang Xiangsui (the authors of Unrestricted Warfare, a text whose authoritativeness was overblown by many in U.S. national security circles), are all from the political control system in the PLA; they are not strategists, commanders, or operational planners. In short, the small number of PLA public commentators do not appear to constitute an organized cadre of messengers and signalers, though they reflect some portion of PLA views. What can be said is that the PLA may constitute a constraint on “new thinking” on territorial and sovereignty issues. It is not yet, as an institution, pushing China in a more militant direction as much as it is perhaps ensuring that China does not go in more cooperative directions on issues directly related to the purview of the PLA such as territorial security.",summarize the following text: ,"example uncritically assuming that a handful of PLA pundits and commentators have influence on foreign policy analysts argue hard-line institutional influence comes from the blog posts, op-eds, and commentary of a handful of retired, quasi-retired, and sometimes still active PLA intellectuals Other commentators argue that these voices may be representative of the PRC leadership Whether the public commentary from hard-line PLA voices reflects official messages from the PLA is open to question The reality is much more complicated despite this political space for hard-line views, these individuals have been criticized internally for their commentary by central authorities There is no particular coherence to some of the views held by some PLA commentators these commentators are not in any position to know much about foreign policy decisionmaking, let alone to influence it the small number of PLA public commentators do not appear to constitute an organized cadre of messengers and signalers It is not pushing China in a more militant direction"
"The problem of commodification We now come to the heart of the objection to the trading of human organs. To allow the sale and purchase of human organs is to reduce these human body parts into mere commodities, like other commodities transacted commercially. Based on what I have said about the profound relationship between the person and his or her body, the trading of human organs would result in the commodification of human beings. To commodify human beings is to fail to accord him or her with proper respect and dignity. To commodify something is to exchange it for money, to treat it as a property that can be bought or sold. To commodify a human being is to treat a being of profound dignity and worth as a mere object to which a price tag can be arbitrarily attached. Donna Dickenson explains the implications of this clearly in her book, Body Shopping: The Economy Fuelled by Flesh and Blood: What is wrong is making a saleable object out of something that should be treated as having value in itself, irrespective of what use might be made of it. Because people have value in themselves, parts of people, you might think, would be particularly problematic. If it’s wrong to make people into objects or things – as slavery does – and if the body is the person, then is it wrong to trade in bodies and their parts? The answer, of course, is “Yes”. According to this view, to pay a person for his kidney is already to violate his dignity and exploit his personhood, regardless of how handsomely he is paid for the organ. Thus, exploitation does not only occur when the poor are poorly paid for their organs because of unscrupulous middlemen in the black market for human organs. It occurs whenever money is offered – however large or small the amount – as payment for a human organ. As Leon Kass, the former Chairman of the US President’s Council on Bioethics has put it so provocatively: We surpass all defensible limits of such conventional commodification when we contemplate making the convention-maker – the human being – just another one of the commensurable. The end comes to be treated merely as a means. Selling our bodies, we come perilously close to selling out our souls. There is even a danger in contemplating such a prospect – for if we come to think about ourselves like pork bellies, pork bellies we will become. Conventional wisdom tells us that some things are simply not for sale. There is, of course, nothing wrong with commerce. In fact, commerce has brought about human flourishing. But this is true only when human life itself is not turned into a commodity. As the Lutheran ethicist, Gilbert Meilaender has so perceptively pointed out, “if we allow ourselves to suppose that [money] is a universal medium of exchange, we are bound to lose our moral bearings”. Society recognises this very well. That is why most societies respond to slavery and prostitution with revulsion. And that is why society recognises that the public offices, the criminal justice system and human beings are not for sale. To this list, we must add the human body and its parts. The French National Ethics Committee makes this point emphatically when it states that it categorically “does not accept that the human body should be used for commercial purposes”. Selling and donating selling our organs for financial gain is profoundly different from giving or donating our organs for the good of the recipients without expecting any rewards. The relationship that we foster in a business transaction is very different from other relationships. The business transaction is based on demand and supply, but it is not just a matter of supplying something in order to meet a demand. When I sell something that you need to you, my motivation is not merely to enable you to meet that need. My motivation is also to meet my need. Thus, I am only willing to meet your need if in return, my need will be met. If my need is not met, I will not take steps to meet your need. Although a commercial transaction may be many things, it is always a quid pro quo relationship. A business transaction, strictly speaking, can never be seen as an expression of unconditional or self-sacrificial love. Giving or donating one’s organ is very different. In donating his or her organ, the donor is performing an act of profound nobility. Donating one’s organ without reward in order to help a fellow human being – whether related to the donor or a stranger – is an act of genuine love and sacrifice on the part of the donor. It is an act of self-giving because, as we have seen, the organ is part of the human body, and the human body cannot be separated from the human self. Giving therefore is a beautiful expression of the donor’s response to the divine call to love another as we love ourselves. In this way, the donor who gives away his or her organ sacrifices himself or herself for another. He or she is willing to put himself or herself at risk in order to save the life of another human being, without expecting any rewards.",summarize the following text: ,"To allow the sale and purchase of human organs is to reduce these human body parts into mere commodities, like other commodities transacted commercially , the trading of human organs would result in the commodification of human beings.

"States often serve as laboratories, for example, by giving concrete form to a position that has a national partisan valence but is not embodied in federal policy. Sometimes a handful of states, or even a single state, define and promote a party's stance on a particular issue. California has advanced the Democratic position with respect to global warming and emissions standards, while Arizona has been the standard-bearer for the Republican Party on immigration. n228 Other times, a wide variety of states participate in developing the national vision with respect to a particular issue. For many years now, the Democratic and Republican positions on guns have been framed by the states in the absence of federal action. Certain states require background checks, limit bulk purchases of firearms, ban assault weapons, or regulate large-capacity magazines. n229 Other states authorize school employees to carry guns, require employers to allow guns in the workplace, or limit law enforcement discretion to deny concealed-carry [*1128] permits. n230 The national partisan cleavage is clear, but it is principally state, not federal, politicians who have shaped it. And while the main divide is between the two parties, states governed by the same party also differ in their substantive policies and the relative attention they pay to gun-related issues. n231 More generally, many issues that are branded ""state"" rather than ""national"" questions - insofar as state governments rather than the federal government are addressing them - are best understood as national experiments_old carried out within state fora. From fracking to in-state tuition for undocumented immigrants; from charter schools to tax rates; from public sector unions to takings for economic development - states serving as laboratories for these issues are participating in national partisan struggle. Even as they undertake discrete actions, state actors are motivated by partisan commitments that transcend state borders. And their experiments_old are often adopted by other states along partisan lines, as organizations like the Republican and Democratic Governors Associations and the American Legislative Exchange Council cross-pollinate. As multiple states flesh out one party's position, composite subnational action comes to define the national. States generate a horizontal nationalism that is no less national for being bottom-up rather than top-down. n232 In time, moreover, such bottom-up partisan activity can force federal politicians' hands or make it attractive for them to take a position they once feared might amount to political suicide. State decisions both fuel and reflect proposed lines of partisan division, and there is slippage between state and federal politics, as state and federal actors [*1129] self-consciously treat states as testing grounds for national policies. n233 Today, for instance, the national Democratic Party embraces same-sex marriage, but only following a partisan contest in the states. As a small and then growing number of blue states adopted marriage equality, same-sex marriage became a Democratic issue at the national level. For some federal politicians, state politics forced the issue. For others, state politics provided cover for a position they already favored. They could cautiously advance the mantra of federalism, rather than support for same-sex marriage as such, and when it turned out their constituents supported same-sex marriage, move to a fuller-throated endorsement of equality. As same-sex marriage has become a Democratic issue at the national level, moreover, additional blue states are taking up the cause, shoring up the base of national support and, at least for now, the national partisan valence. Debates about the legalization of marijuana also have something of this character. Recent ballot initiatives in Colorado and Washington have legalized recreational marijuana under state law, a group of mostly blue states has decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana, still more states have decriminalized medicinal marijuana, and a growing number of state Democratic parties and politicians now endorse legalization. n234 Such state activity puts pressure on the national Democratic Party to follow suit, or - more likely in the short term - to adopt a modus vivendi approach to state legalization. n235 As with same-sex marriage, moreover, federalism gives national politicians who favor legalization a lower-stakes way to advance this substantive position: [*1130] calling for respect for state decisionmaking has a different ring than calling for outright legalization. n236 If popular support for legalization continues to grow, national politicians can transform arguments for federalism into arguments about ending the United States' war on drugs, but they will not have committed to this position if popular support wanes.

"In his reply to McCarthy’s critique, Habermas refuses the concept of mutual accommodation that McCarthy introduces. He entirely cedes the point that we must expect disagreement—an ideal of argument presupposes this—and that this awareness should form part of reflective participation in democratic debate. He then maps out three positions on dialogue under conditions of pluralism, rejecting the first two and endorsing the third. The first position holds that it is impossible to escape clashing horizons; when they encounter one another, the only possibility for overcoming their differences is the assimilation of one to the other. The second position, which is Rawls’s, envisions an overlapping consensus (parties accept a consensus result for different reasons).24 And the third position promotes the progressive expansion of horizons: beyond the limit of their respective self-interpretations and world views, the different parties refer to a presumptively shared moral point of view that, under the symmetrical conditions of discourse and mutual learning, requires an ever broader decentering of perspectives. What Habermas insists upon is the necessity that people accept regulating procedures elaborated with the goal of coexistence for the same reasons. As he concludes, “We can agree to the mutual toleration of forms of life and worldviews that represent existential challenges for each other only if we have a basis of shared beliefs for ‘agreeing to disagree.’”25
In the case of McCarthy, whose position is closer to Rawls’s, the elaboration of those virtues that would best express a goal of accommodation—[END PAGE 183] tolerance, respect—are elevated above any principle of shared reasons. This creates a situation in which ethos, in the sense of an avowed form of ethical life, is somehow allowed to cushion the participants against argumentative challenges, a condition that Habermas is persistently concerned to disallow. In its most pronounced form, such an approach risks collapsing argument into identity: here the ineluctable fact of difference—whether radically conceived or more traditionally pluralist—becomes the overriding reason for reasoned disagreement. But of course the position that McCarthy advances need not be taken so far: read another way, there is a potential similarity between McCarthy’s position and the new cosmopolitanism, insofar as both locate a virtue in refusing the insistence on explicit justification and rational agreement that we find in Habermas. The logic of accommodation implies a willingness not to argue out every last detail, but rather to exercise the tact that consists in recognizing that we may differ. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that accommodation here operates as an attitude informing democratic practices that otherwise still need to be based on procedures for ensuring open debate and equitable forms of representation. These procedures can be refined and debated themselves, but never suspended completely. Ethos in this view does not replace or eclipse procedure, just as cosmopolitanism has the potential to refine universalism through tact and phronesis, without disavowing its fundamental universalistic principles.
By way of closing, I want to address objections that have been raised against the privileging of argument and debate as an ethicopolitical ideal. It has been claimed that such an ideal is too narrow in its conception of how political commitments find expression, and unable to comprehend nonrational forms of solidarity or aesthetic political practices (theatrical display, performativity, ironic critique). I argued in chapter 1 for a democratic model of politics that could acknowledge a wide range of forms of expression as possessing theoretical and political significance: in this sense I have no quarrel with those critics of Habermas who seek to emphasize affective or aesthetic modes. And I have suggested elsewhere in this volume, most particularly in the essay on pragmatism, that liberalism should remain open to a plurality of characterological and expressive modes, rather than seek to elevate a specific temperament or persona.
I would argue, however, that the accommodation of plural modes of expression still requires procedural elaboration if it is to have any political meaning or effectiveness, as McCarthy’s own critique makes clear. In order to affect institutionalized deliberative procedures, nonrational forms of political expression require some form of translation into terms that can impact decision making and policy. While dramatic displays of protest that rely on theatrical tactics and visceral power cannot entirely [END PAGE 184] be explained in rational terms, and can be recognized to have a force on their own terms, in order to affect policy they have to be translated into claims recognizable within existing political institutions.

"India and Pakistan are the two countries most likely to engage in nuclear war or so goes the common wisdom. Yet if recent events are any indication, the worlds most vigorous nuclear competition may well erupt between Asias two giants: India and China. Both countries already house significant and growing arsenals. China is estimated to have approximately 450 warheads; India, roughly 100. Though intensifying as of late, Sino-Indian nuclear competition has a long history: Indias pursuit of a weapons program in the 1960s was triggered in part by Chinas initial nuclear tests, and the two have eyed one anothers arsenals with mounting concern ever since. The competition intensified in 2007, when China began to upgrade missile facilities near Tibet, placing targets in northern India within range of its forces. Yet the stakes have been raised yet again in recent months. Indian defence minister A.K. Antony announced last month that the military will soon incorporate into its arsenal a new intermediate-range missile, the Agni-III, which is capable of reaching all of Chinas major cities. Delhi is also reportedly considering redeploying survivable, medium-range Agni-IIs to its northeastern border. And just last month, India shifted a squadron of Su-30MKI fighters to a base just 150 kilometers from the disputed Sino-Indian border. An Indian Air Force official told Defence News these nuclear-armed planes could operate deep within China with mid-flight refueling. For its part, China continues to enhance the quality, quantity and delivery systems of its nuclear forces. The Pentagon reported last month that the Peoples Liberation Army has replaced older, vulnerable ballistic missiles deployed in Western China with modern, survivable ones; this transition has taken place over the last four years. Chinas Hainan Island naval base houses new, nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines and affords those boats easy access to the Indian Ocean. Chinas military is also developing a new, longer range submarine-launched ballistic missile which will allow its subs to strike targets throughout India from the secure confines of the South China Sea. No single event has stoked this rise in tensions. China, already concerned about Indias growing strength and its desire to play a greater role in Asia, is even less enthused about the burgeoning strategic partnership between Delhi and Washington. While Beijing has learned to live with American forces on its eastern periphery, the possibility of an intimate US-India military relationship has generated fears of encirclement. The ongoing Sino-Indian border dispute, as well as Indias position astride Chinas key maritime shipping lanes, has made the prospect of a Washington-Delhi axis appear particularly troubling. India likewise feels encircled by Chinas so-called string of pearls: a series of Chinese-built, ostensibly commercial port facilities in the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Beijings military ties to Pakistan, interference in the Kashmir dispute and references to Arunachal Pradesh, an Indian state, as Southern Tibet have done little to reassure New Delhi of Chinese intentions. The rapid growth of Chinas conventional military might in recent years: between 2000 and 2009, Chinas military spending more than tripled: and the lack of clarity as to its intentions, has spurred India to pursue its own military modernization. These shifts in Indias and Chinas nuclear force postures thus represent only the latest and most serious efforts to constrain and convey dissatisfaction with the others perceived regional ambitions. But they are more troubling than conventional redeployments. There is a point at which efforts to enhance deterrence can foster an arms race. Any attempt on the part of China to increase its own defenses necessarily weakens, or is perceived to weaken, the security of India, thus spurring further defence build-ups; the opposite is true as well. Shifts in nuclear force posture can be particularly disruptive, and have been known to precipitate crises. Upon the discovery of Soviet efforts to deploy missiles to Cuba in 1962, for example, the US responded militarily with a naval quarantine of the island, bringing Washington and Moscow as close as they have ever come to a nuclear war. Finally, the redeployments of Indias and Chinas nuclear forces suggest that there is deep-seated and growing discord between the two Asian giants. This is troubling news for a region whose future peace and prosperity depends heavily on continued comity between Delhi and Beijing. It is only a matter of time before the China-India military competition begins to affect neighboring states. Chinas nuclear force modernization, for instance, stands to threaten not only India, but also Korea, Japan and other US partners in Asia. A dramatic defence build-up in India, meanwhile, will no doubt leave Pakistan feeling less secure. Tensions are unlikely to ease any time soon. The two countries appear much closer to the brink of an all-out arms race than they do to any resolution of their differences.",summarize the following text: ,"the worlds most vigorous nuclear competition may well erupt between Asias two giants: India and China.

"Third, it is difficult to understand why mere compensation destroys acts of generosity or blots out the ability of persons to give of themselves for the good. Fire fi ghters, police, and other rescue workers are deemed heroic for giving of themselves for the good and are yet paid for their labor and risk taking. Professors may go beyond their offi cial duties to help students out of generosity, yet still collect a paycheck. Professionals, who work in the nonprofi t sector of the economy are often lauded for having generously given of themselves to serve others still receive compensation. Elementary school teachers are held up as examples of individuals who have forgone potentially more profi table careers so as to teach, still sign contracts, and engage in collective bargaining over wages and working conditions. In the United States, the value of money and goods that persons generously donate to charitable organizations may usually be deducted from one’s income, prior to calculating the amount of federal income tax owed. This valuable deduction is designed to encourage people to be generous. (Americans gave more than 300 billion dollars to charity in 2007. 11 ) Churches may extend a contract for food service to a member of the parish in need of work. Plumbers may take the time carefully to explain how the repair was performed, even while writing out the bill. A physician may waive part of his fee when treating needy patients, accepting less of a fi nancial payment than he is entitled.
Generosity, the choice to give of oneself for the good of others, in many fashions and often without much fanfare, finds its way into the marketplace of goods and services. Thus, it is highly implausible to conclude that “ Each of these kinds of markets, by its very nature , would entail the dissolution of the ethic of gifting ” (emphasis added, 599). The market by its very nature does not destroy generosity, altruism, or gift giving. Such values can and are brought routinely into the market. Regarding compensated organ donation: how is a grieving family any less generous, if they agree to accept compensation for donating the organs of a deceased loved one? Such compensated donations will likely save many lives. Fourth, the persistent reference to organ donation as an “ altruistic gift ” embedded within the “ ethic of generosity ” may be more lofty rhetoric than empirical reality. Presumably many organ donations are fully altruistically motivated; however, it is difficult to know what percentage falls squarely into this category, without any private negotiation for benefits or implicit quid pro quo. Human motivations are complex, multifaceted, and not always fully acknowledged, even to oneself. It is, therefore, diffi cult fully to illuminate a donor’s or family’s actual motivations.
Requiring strict adherence to an ethic of generosity would rule out many donations. Most living organ donations are to family members or close friends, for example. Such donations might be motivated by love or beneficence or, perhaps, by family loyalty, gratitude, guilt, or avoidance of the shame of failing to donate. For these donors, their willingness to donate stems from their relationship with the particular patient and may not be fully altruistically motivated, much less embedded within an ethic of generosity. Some individuals stand to be financially supported by others who are in need of an organ transplant. Perhaps by donating a kidney to his father Joe saves the life of the man who will be financing his small business and who has the expertise to help him think through his long-term business plans. Or, perhaps, Anna believes that donating an organ to her niece, something she had good reason to do anyway, will also increase the likelihood that her uncle Alexei will leave her a generous inheritance in his will.

"India and Pakistan are the two countries most likely to engage in nuclear war or so goes the common wisdom. Yet if recent events are any indication, the worlds most vigorous nuclear competition may well erupt between Asias two giants: India and China. Both countries already house significant and growing arsenals. China is estimated to have approximately 450 warheads; India, roughly 100. Though intensifying as of late, Sino-Indian nuclear competition has a long history: Indias pursuit of a weapons program in the 1960s was triggered in part by Chinas initial nuclear tests, and the two have eyed one anothers arsenals with mounting concern ever since. The competition intensified in 2007, when China began to upgrade missile facilities near Tibet, placing targets in northern India within range of its forces. Yet the stakes have been raised yet again in recent months. Indian defence minister A.K. Antony announced last month that the military will soon incorporate into its arsenal a new intermediate-range missile, the Agni-III, which is capable of reaching all of Chinas major cities. Delhi is also reportedly considering redeploying survivable, medium-range Agni-IIs to its northeastern border. And just last month, India shifted a squadron of Su-30MKI fighters to a base just 150 kilometers from the disputed Sino-Indian border. An Indian Air Force official told Defence News these nuclear-armed planes could operate deep within China with mid-flight refueling. For its part, China continues to enhance the quality, quantity and delivery systems of its nuclear forces. The Pentagon reported last month that the Peoples Liberation Army has replaced older, vulnerable ballistic missiles deployed in Western China with modern, survivable ones; this transition has taken place over the last four years. Chinas Hainan Island naval base houses new, nuclear-powered ballistic-missile submarines and affords those boats easy access to the Indian Ocean. Chinas military is also developing a new, longer range submarine-launched ballistic missile which will allow its subs to strike targets throughout India from the secure confines of the South China Sea. No single event has stoked this rise in tensions. China, already concerned about Indias growing strength and its desire to play a greater role in Asia, is even less enthused about the burgeoning strategic partnership between Delhi and Washington. While Beijing has learned to live with American forces on its eastern periphery, the possibility of an intimate US-India military relationship has generated fears of encirclement. The ongoing Sino-Indian border dispute, as well as Indias position astride Chinas key maritime shipping lanes, has made the prospect of a Washington-Delhi axis appear particularly troubling. India likewise feels encircled by Chinas so-called string of pearls: a series of Chinese-built, ostensibly commercial port facilities in the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea. Beijings military ties to Pakistan, interference in the Kashmir dispute and references to Arunachal Pradesh, an Indian state, as Southern Tibet have done little to reassure New Delhi of Chinese intentions. The rapid growth of Chinas conventional military might in recent years: between 2000 and 2009, Chinas military spending more than tripled: and the lack of clarity as to its intentions, has spurred India to pursue its own military modernization. These shifts in Indias and Chinas nuclear force postures thus represent only the latest and most serious efforts to constrain and convey dissatisfaction with the others perceived regional ambitions. But they are more troubling than conventional redeployments. There is a point at which efforts to enhance deterrence can foster an arms race. Any attempt on the part of China to increase its own defenses necessarily weakens, or is perceived to weaken, the security of India, thus spurring further defence build-ups; the opposite is true as well. Shifts in nuclear force posture can be particularly disruptive, and have been known to precipitate crises. Upon the discovery of Soviet efforts to deploy missiles to Cuba in 1962, for example, the US responded militarily with a naval quarantine of the island, bringing Washington and Moscow as close as they have ever come to a nuclear war. Finally, the redeployments of Indias and Chinas nuclear forces suggest that there is deep-seated and growing discord between the two Asian giants. This is troubling news for a region whose future peace and prosperity depends heavily on continued comity between Delhi and Beijing. It is only a matter of time before the China-India military competition begins to affect neighboring states. Chinas nuclear force modernization, for instance, stands to threaten not only India, but also Korea, Japan and other US partners in Asia. A dramatic defence build-up in India, meanwhile, will no doubt leave Pakistan feeling less secure. Tensions are unlikely to ease any time soon. The two countries appear much closer to the brink of an all-out arms race than they do to any resolution of their differences.",summarize the following text: ,"the worlds most vigorous nuclear competition may well erupt between Asias two giants: India and China.

"The good news is that even without a congressional action, and even given President Obama’s opposition to legalizing recreational or medical marijuana, the CSA provides a standing invitation for his Administration to work out contractual cooperation agreements with Colorado, Washington, and some or all of the sixteen other medical marijuana states and the District of Columbia. The CSA not only directs that the Attorney General “shall cooperate” with the state and local governments on drugs but also gives him broad discretion to do so, through means including legally binding contractual agreements.
This is a president who has taken bold unilateral action amid congressional paralysis on issues including immigration (ordering amnesty for a generation of Dream Act immigrants), gay marriage (an extraordinary refusal to defend in federal court the duly enacted Defense of Marriage Act), and military force abroad (bombing Libya without consulting Congress, using drones to kill people in multiple countries, and much more). Doing with marijuana what the congressionally adopted CSA tells the Attorney General he should do (cooperate with the states) should not require much boldness.
Indeed, with this option sitting in plain view, it would be intolerable for the Obama Administration to put officials in eighteen states and D.C. to the choice of either ignoring the will of their own voters or gambling on limited enforcement of a federal marijuana law that is widely seen as outmoded. The Obama Administration should instead work with Colorado and Washington (and later with other medical marijuana states) to implement their partial legalization initiatives in ways that serve both federal and state interests in protecting the public health and safety.
Written contractual agreements should, suggests Tamar Todd of the Drug Policy Alliance, provide for Colorado and Washington to tightly control and regulate licensing, production and distribution within their borders and do everything feasible to prevent diversion to other states; for federal resources to focus primarily on preventing such diversion; and for federal and state law enforcement agencies to cooperate in targeting those who grow and distribute marijuana without state licenses. This would be more consonant with the CSA’s intent to control trafficking, abuse, and diversion than for federal and state governments to be at cross-purposes.
Federal-state agreements should also include clear, unambiguous commitments by the Attorney General to exercise his prosecutorial discretion to ensure that his Justice Department subordinates take no enforcement action against any state-licensed marijuana supplier unless the Attorney General (or a high-level designee) personally finds, in writing, that the supplier has violated state as well as federal law and that state and local authorities are unable or unwilling to correct the problem. Any such agreement could be voidable at the¶ option of the Attorney General if he believes that the state has failed to carry out responsibly its commitment to regulate.
This is not to suggest that such a contractual agreement could provide a state-licensed marijuana supplier with a legal defense recognized by the courts in the event of a federal prosecution or other enforcement action that violates the agreement. But the formality and specificity of a contractual agreement would provide a strong political deterrent to such an unwarranted enforcement action. It would also protect federal interests far more effectively than would a federal effort to abort states’ experiments_old with partial legalization.
The commitments that states would make in negotiating contractual agreements, and the subsequent federal scrutiny of their compliance, would help keep states honest, giving them a powerful incentive to take seriously their obligations to control marijuana distribution and accommodate federal priorities—as, for example, California has not done with medical marijuana. By the same token, the process of sitting down with the states and drawing up agreements would force the federal government to get its act together, by setting enforcement priorities and then applying them consistently—again, in marked contrast to the chaos and uncertainty that have so far marked the federal government’s approach to medical marijuana.
The moral is that we will need enlightened, determined leadership on both the federal and state level for the partial legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington to avoid the federal-state conflicts and confusion that have so far been emblematic of the Obama-Holder medical marijuana regime. Fortunately, the leaders of Colorado and Washington State appear so far to be doing a better job of setting clear rules and protecting federal interests than have the states whose medical marijuana regimes have been on the receiving end of most federal crackdowns.

"Third, it is difficult to understand why mere compensation destroys acts of generosity or blots out the ability of persons to give of themselves for the good. Fire fi ghters, police, and other rescue workers are deemed heroic for giving of themselves for the good and are yet paid for their labor and risk taking. Professors may go beyond their offi cial duties to help students out of generosity, yet still collect a paycheck. Professionals, who work in the nonprofi t sector of the economy are often lauded for having generously given of themselves to serve others still receive compensation. Elementary school teachers are held up as examples of individuals who have forgone potentially more profi table careers so as to teach, still sign contracts, and engage in collective bargaining over wages and working conditions. In the United States, the value of money and goods that persons generously donate to charitable organizations may usually be deducted from one’s income, prior to calculating the amount of federal income tax owed. This valuable deduction is designed to encourage people to be generous. (Americans gave more than 300 billion dollars to charity in 2007. 11 ) Churches may extend a contract for food service to a member of the parish in need of work. Plumbers may take the time carefully to explain how the repair was performed, even while writing out the bill. A physician may waive part of his fee when treating needy patients, accepting less of a fi nancial payment than he is entitled.
Generosity, the choice to give of oneself for the good of others, in many fashions and often without much fanfare, finds its way into the marketplace of goods and services. Thus, it is highly implausible to conclude that “ Each of these kinds of markets, by its very nature , would entail the dissolution of the ethic of gifting ” (emphasis added, 599). The market by its very nature does not destroy generosity, altruism, or gift giving. Such values can and are brought routinely into the market. Regarding compensated organ donation: how is a grieving family any less generous, if they agree to accept compensation for donating the organs of a deceased loved one? Such compensated donations will likely save many lives. Fourth, the persistent reference to organ donation as an “ altruistic gift ” embedded within the “ ethic of generosity ” may be more lofty rhetoric than empirical reality. Presumably many organ donations are fully altruistically motivated; however, it is difficult to know what percentage falls squarely into this category, without any private negotiation for benefits or implicit quid pro quo. Human motivations are complex, multifaceted, and not always fully acknowledged, even to oneself. It is, therefore, diffi cult fully to illuminate a donor’s or family’s actual motivations.
Requiring strict adherence to an ethic of generosity would rule out many donations. Most living organ donations are to family members or close friends, for example. Such donations might be motivated by love or beneficence or, perhaps, by family loyalty, gratitude, guilt, or avoidance of the shame of failing to donate. For these donors, their willingness to donate stems from their relationship with the particular patient and may not be fully altruistically motivated, much less embedded within an ethic of generosity. Some individuals stand to be financially supported by others who are in need of an organ transplant. Perhaps by donating a kidney to his father Joe saves the life of the man who will be financing his small business and who has the expertise to help him think through his long-term business plans.

"I think that we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest. In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof. This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis. In this sense, the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony. This is true in general, but it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished. It is a fortiori true of whatever is called ‘the West,’ of which the US has for about a century represented the vanguard. Lacking hegemony, the sheer drive for domination has to show its true face, its raw violence. The usual, traditional ideological justifications for dominance (such as bringing democracy and freedom here and there) have now become very weak because of the contempt that the dominant nations (the US and its most powerful allies) regularly show toward legality, morality, and humanity. Of course, the so-called rogue states, thriving on corruption, do not fare any better in this sense, but for them, when they act autonomously and against the dictates of ‘the West,’ the specter of punishment, in the form of retaliatory war or even indictment from the International Criminal Court, remains a clear limit, a possibility. Not so for the dominant nations: who will stop the United States from striking anywhere at will, or Israel from regularly massacring people in the Gaza Strip, or envious France from once again trying its luck in Africa? Yet, though still dominant, these nations are painfully aware of their structural, ontological and historical, weakness. All attempts at concealing that weakness (and the uncomfortable awareness of it) only heighten the brutality in the exertion of what remains of their dominance. Although they rely on a highly sophisticated military machine (the technology of drones is a clear instance of this) and on an equally sophisticated diplomacy, which has traditionally been and increasingly is an outpost for military operations and global policing (now excellently incarnated by Africom), they know that they have lost their hegemony.¶ ‘Domination without hegemony’ is a phrase that Giovanni Arrighi uses in his study of the long twentieth century and his lineages of the twenty-first century (1994/2010 and 2007). Originating with Ranajit Guha (1992), the phrase captures the singularity of the global crisis, the terminal stage of sovereignty, in Arrighi’s “historical investigation of the present and of the future” (1994/2010: 221). It acquires particular meaning in the light of Arrighi’s notion of the bifurcation of financial and military power. Without getting into the question, treated by Arrighi, of the rise of China and East Asia, what I want to note is that for Arrighi, early in the twenty-first century, and certainly with the ill-advised and catastrophic war against Iraq, “the US belle époque came to an end and US world hegemony entered what in all likelihood is its terminal crisis.” He continues:¶ Although the United States remains by far the world’s most powerful state, its relationship to the rest of the world is now best described as one of ‘domination without hegemony’ (1994/2010: 384). What can the US do next? Not much, short of brutal dominance. In the last few years, we have seen president Obama praising himself for the killing of Osama bin Laden. While that action was most likely unlawful, too (Noam Chomsky has often noted that bin Laden was a suspect, not someone charged with or found guilty of a crime), it is certain that you can kill all the bin Ladens of the world without gaining back a bit of hegemony. In fact, this killing, just like G. W. Bush’s war against Iraq, makes one think of a Mafia-style regolamento di conti more than any other thing. Barack Obama is less forthcoming about the killing of 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, whose fate many have correctly compared to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (killed in Florida by a self-appointed security watchman), but it is precisely in cases like this one that the weakness at the heart of empire, the ill-concealed and uncontrolled fury for the loss of hegemony, becomes visible. The frenzy denies the possibility of power as care, which is what should replace hegemony, let alone domination. Nor am I sure I share Arrighi’s optimistic view about the possible rise of a new hegemonic center of power in East Asia and China: probably that would only be a shift in the axis of uncaring power, unable to affect, let alone exit, the paradigm of sovereignty and violence. What is needed is rather a radical alternative in which power as domination, with or without hegemony, is replaced by power as care – in other words, a poetic rather than military and financial shift.",summarize the following text: ,"we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished.

Requiring strict adherence to an ethic of generosity would rule out many donations Most living organ donations are to family members or close friends Such donations might be motivated by love or beneficence or, perhaps, by family loyalty, gratitude, guilt, or avoidance of the shame their willingness to donate stems from their relationship with the particular patient may not be fully altruistically motivated, much less embedded within an ethic of generosity. Some individuals stand to be financially supported by others who are in need of an organ transplant Perhaps by donating a kidney to his father Joe saves the life of the man who will be financing his small business . Or, perhaps, Anna believes that donating an organ will also increase the likelihood that her uncle Alexei will leave her a generous inheritance in his will. Couples have utilized in vitro fertilization with genetic testing and embryo wastage, so as to select embryos for implantation, The donor’s altruism is nonexistent in such cases. Should these types of organ and tissue transfers be legally forbidden?"
"Borrowing from its English forebears, the United States once had a form of punishment called civil death. Civil death extinguished most civil rights of a person convicted of a crime and largely put that person outside the law’s protection. Civil death as an institution faded away in the middle of the twentieth century. Policymakers recognized that almost all convicted persons eventually rejoin society, and therefore, it was wise and fair to allow them to participate in society with some measure of equality.
This Article proposes that civil death has surreptitiously reemerged. It no longer exists under that name, but effectually a new civil death is meted out to persons convicted of crimes in the form of a substantial and permanent change in legal status, operationalized by a network of collateral consequences. A person convicted of a crime, whether misdemeanor or felony, 1 may be subject to disenfranchisement 2 (or deportation if a noncitizen 3), criminal registration and community notification requirements, 4 and the ineligibility to live, work, or be present in a particular location. 5 Some are not allowed to live outside of civil confinement at all. 6 In addition, the person may be subject to occupational debarment 7 or ineligibility to establish or maintain family relations. 8 While the entire array of collateral consequences may not apply to any given person, the State is always able to add new disabilities or to extend existing limitations. As a practical matter, every criminal sentence contains the following unwritten term:
The law regards you as having a “shattered character.” 9 Therefore, in addition to any incarceration or fine, you are subject to legal restrictions and limitations on your civil rights, conduct, employment, residence, and relationships. For the rest of your life, the United States and any State or locaity where you travel or reside may impose, at any time, additional restrictions and limitations they deem warranted. Their power to do so is limited only by their reasonable discretion. They may also require you to pay the expense of these restrictions and limitations.
For many people convicted of crimes, the most severe and long-lasting effect of conviction is not imprisonment or fine. Rather, it is being subjected to collateral consequences involving the actual or potential loss of civil rights, parental rights, public benefits, and employment opportunities.
The magnitude of the problem is greater than ever. The commonly used term “mass incarceration” implies that the most typical tool of the criminal justice system is imprisonment. Indeed, there are two million people in American prisons and jails, a huge number, but one which is dwarfed by the six-and-a-half million or so on probation or parole10 and the tens of millions in free society with criminal records. 11 The vast majority of people who have been convicted of crimes are not currently in prison. However, because of their criminal records, they remain subject to governmental regulation of various aspects of their lives and concomitant imposition of benefits and burdens. People convicted of crimes are not subject to just one collateral consequence, or even a handful. Instead, hundreds and sometimes thousands of such consequences apply under federal and state constitutional provisions, statutes, administrative regulations, and ordinances.12 As one Ohio court recognized in 1848, “[D]isabilities . . . imposed upon the convict” are “part of the punishment, and in many cases the most important part.” 13
As practically important as collateral consequences are, in a line of cases examining individual restrictions, the Court has held they are subject to extremely limited constitutional regulation. 14 Because collateral¶ consequences are deemed to be something other than criminal sanctions, they can generally be applied without notice from the court or defense counsel at the time of a guilty plea.15 Moreover, new ones can be imposed retroactively after plea bargains have been made and sentences fully satisfied.16
There is a little-noticed but significant countertradition. In Weems v. United States 17 and Trop v. Dulles, 18 the Supreme Court found punishments cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment in part because of burdensome and systematic collateral consequences. 19 In addition, alongside cases holding that particular collateral consequences were not punishment, other Supreme Court decisions have shaped the right to jury trial, right to counsel, and other aspects of criminal procedure in light of the fact that collateral consequences are at stake in criminal judgments.
The Court’s cases, then, simultaneously suggest that individual collateral consequences are not punishment, but that systematic loss of legal status in the form of actual or potential subjection to an interlocking system of collateral consequences is punishment. This paradox can be reconciled by understanding the degradation of a convict’s legal status to be a unitary punishment, the new civil death.

"First, the argument that the prohibition of organ sales worsens the position of the poor because it removes an option in their already deprived lives: Here the authors (1) of the paper have cleverly stated the most potent contrary argument themselves: the solution is the removal of poverty. They, however, appear to consider this a distant possibility, and in the meantime advocate the selling of kidneys as one option available to the poor to better their circumstances. It would have been useful if the authors had adduced material to show how and how long this so-called option works. In the absence of any sustained means of livelihood, it is quite probable that the money obtained by the sale of one organ will soon be gone. What shall the seller do next? Sell another organ? An eye? A lung? And when all the paired organs are gone?
Let us accept that the risk involved in nephrectomy is not high. But is it not a fundamental tenet of medicine that the risk must be in the medical interest of the patient? What medical advantage does the donor obtain? Undoubtedly the risk is the same for those who sell and those living donors who do not sell but donate out of regard for the recipient. Radcliffe -Richards et al move from this fact to the inference that therefore there should be no difference between the two groups with surprising facility. What matters here is motive: the implicit coercion in the case of the poor who sell out of financial compulsion. Radcliffe - Richards equating of the motives of the better off, and comparing the risks of nephrectomy with the risks of dangerous sports can only be described as callous. No one prevents them from campaigning against these sports if they are so moved, but for us activists in the Third World there are more pressing matters than looking after the well - being of the jet- set. A profile of the sellers would be revealing. It will come as no surprise that they all belong to the Third World. And it will also come as no surprise that besides the wealthy in the Third World, the potential buyers will be from the rich, white, First World and from the petroleum driven nouveau - riche! No wonder a veritable industry of philosophers has risen in these countries to justify this horrible practice. And in the honourable tradition of colonialism there will always be locals ready to aid and abet the conquerors. He who pays the piper calls the tune!
Radcliffe-Richards et al (1) seem fixated on the belief that legalising and controlling the trade in human organs will protect the exploited. The situation in other fields shows that this is naïve indeed. In Hamburg, legal commercial sex workers throng the glittering Reeperbahn, while in the sad, sordid, shadowy bylanes the illegal commercial sex workers have no shortage of clients. This in a country where social conditions ensure much closer adherence to the rule of law than is the case in most developing countries, which are the main source of people willing to sell their organs. In India, child labour is a reality. Poverty is the main reason for its existence. The efforts of numerous groups have succeeded in making it illegal. Have they removed an “option” for the poor? After all, the poor consciously send these children to work. Would it be a good idea to legalise the practice and control it on the theoretical basis that it would improve the lot of these unfortunate children? There are many reasons why such trades will always be open to exploitation. The most potent one is that the victims are poor and voiceless while the beneficiaries are generally rich and powerful.
The argument that organ selling is acceptable because some services are available to the rich, which are not available to the poor, is extremely strange. Do the authors believe that the presence of undesirable practices justifies adding a few more? What will the limit be? Who will decide how many more are to be allowed? No prizes for getting it right. The answer is: the rich and powerful. Permit whatever is in their interest. They can always hire a motley crew of philosophers and technicians to justify it and make it possible.
Why is altruism necessary in organ donation? It is because it will ensure the absence of exploitation. It is nobody’s case that unless some useful action is altruistic it is better to forbid it altogether. Altruism removes the profit - making element. It will help ensure that organ transplantation is done in the best possible way and thereby achieve the best possible medical result. It will also ensure that no vital organ is removed from a living person. On the other hand, trade in kidneys definitely puts one on the slippery slope to selling vital organs as documented elsewhere. (2) Here, the authors utilise the familiar stratagem of positing and demolishing imaginary weak arguments against their stated position, while ignoring the real and powerful argument.",summarize the following text: ,"In the absence of any sustained means of livelihood, it is quite probable that the money obtained by the sale of one organ will soon be gone.

"Indian casinos constitute 40% of the American gaming market. For a large number of American Indian nations, Indian gaming has been a key resource in facilitating tribal self-governance and self-determination. Approximately 237 tribes operate 442 Indian gaming facilities in the United States.1 Given the importance of Indian gaming to tribal governments, Congress must consider how online gaming will affect Indian tribes and insure that any federal laws enacted to regulate Internet gaming give Indian tribes a fair opportunity to share in the Internet gaming boom. The Supreme Court recognized that tribes had inherent powers to regulate gaming on their own lands in California v. Cabazon Band of Missions Indians2 in 1987. That decision produced a nationwide debate on Indian gaming that was largely resolved the next year when President Ronald Reagan signed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act into law. The Reagan administration was strongly supportive of Indian gaming even before the Cabazon decision. The Reagan Administration believed that revenues from Indian gaming could increase tribal self-sufficiency and reduce tribal dependence on federal appropriations. When it enacted IGRA, Congress recognized the exclusive right of tribes to regulate gaming on their lands and sought to promote tribal economic development, self-sufficiency and strong self government.3 Moreover, Congress refused to privatize the benefits of Indian gaming. It mandated in IGRA that gaming revenues must be used primarily for public purposes, naming five authorized uses: “(i) to fund tribal government operations or programs; (ii) to provide for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members; (iii) to promote tribal economic development; (iv) to donate to charitable organizations; or (v) to help fund operations of local government agencies.”4 The legal regime set forth in IGRA has allowed many tribes to prosper. The Reagan Administration’s hopes for Indian gaming have been realized, probably beyond their wildest expectations. Indian gaming has been the greatest economic engine on Indian reservations that the United States has ever seen. From 1998 to 2010, Indian Gaming grossed more than $246.2 billion nationwide.5 Consistent with the purposes specified by Congress, most of these have been used to fund tribal operations and promote the economic development and welfare of tribes and Indian people. For instance, according to the National Indian Gaming Association’s (NIGA) Economic Impact Report for 2009, 237 Indian tribes in 28 states had used Indian gaming to create new jobs, fund essential government services and rebuild communities. In 2009 tribal governments generated $26.2 billion gross revenue from gaming alone - 20% of that net revenue was dedicated to education, children and elders, culture and charity, 19% to economic development, 17% to health care, 17% to police and fire protection, 16% towards infrastructure and 11% towards housing.6 While tribal revenues allocation plans that provide for per capita payments to individual tribal members have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior and have earned a great deal of press attention, most of these payments have done little more than to increase household income and lift some Indian citizens out of poverty. In addition to gaming revenues, tribes generated $3.2 billion in gross revenue from related hospitality and entertainment services such as resorts and entertainment complexes.7 As of 2009, tribal governments had directly or indirectly generated 628,000 jobs nationwide for American Indians and others.8 As a result of gaming, tribes have experienced extensive economic development and built strong governmental infrastructures. In sum, gaming has assisted in producing strong tribal governmental infrastructures. Tribal gaming revenues have been a boon to the federal government as well. In light of the federal government’s trust responsibility to the tribes, it would likely have had to spend more on federal Indian programs in the absence of Indian gaming. In addition, Indian gaming revenues have produced tax revenues for the federal government, both directly and indirectly, and revenue shares for state governments. Although predictions are difficult, especially about the future, Internet gaming poses some magnitude of threat to the brick and mortar casino industry, including tribal casinos. Federal policy toward Internet gaming going forward should recognize the significant risk to the stable revenue stream upon which many tribes have been able to depend. Under the worst case scenario, a shift in the market for gaming away from land-based casinos and toward Internet gaming could vastly increase revenues to private and even off-shore Internet gaming companies and decrease tribal governmental revenues, plunging some tribal nations back into poverty. Federal policy must recognize and seek to mitigate this risk, so as to preserve gaming as a viable means of raising governmental resources for tribal governments.",summarize the following text: ,"Indian casinos constitute 40% of the American gaming market.

"Years after a recession hammered state budgets, forcing across-the-board cuts to programs and services, the economic recovery is once again bolstering personal and corporate incomes, and swelling state coffers beyond expectations.
Initial reports show many states ended Fiscal Year 2014 with budget surpluses, thanks to growing tax revenue collections. In some cases, states have hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to spend. Other states pulled in just a few million dollars over the break-even point. But even the smallest surplus is better than the tide of red ink that washed over states during the depths of the recession.
California ended the fiscal year with $1.9 billion left over in its state general fund, Controller John Chiang (D) said last week, the first time the general fund ended with a positive cash balance since 2007, the year before the recession began. The state Department of Finance has projected a $4.2 billion surplus for Fiscal Year 2014-2015, which began July 1.
Ohio netted an $800 million surplus, its fourth straight year of black ink. New Hampshire ended the fiscal year $5.6 million over budget. South Dakota notched its third straight surplus. Indiana, Arkansas and Georgia have all reported nine-figure surpluses just days after the fiscal year ended.
The surpluses, however, aren’t solely positive news. Tax collections in many states are lower than they were last year, when wealthy taxpayers took personal income early in hopes of avoiding the fallout from the fiscal cliff. That gave states an artificial boost in revenue during the last fiscal year, and forced budget analysts in most states to plan for lower revenues the following year.
“When the federal tax laws changed at the end of 2012, there was a significant shift in income out of calendar year 2013 into calendar year 2012,” said Tim Keen, director of Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management. “We spent a lot of time when we made our revenue estimates considering that fact.”
Ohio took in less in the 2013-2014 Fiscal Year than it did over the previous year, but the state still ran a surplus. “We tried to be conservative to make sure our estimates were achievable, and they turned out to be,” Keen said.
Arkansas collected less in sales tax and income tax than in Fiscal Year 2012-2013, but still came in $174 million above projections. New Hampshire’s budget surplus was actually below the $26 million budget analysts had projected. Georgia reported collecting $944 million in corporate tax revenues over the fiscal year after pulling in just $590 million in 2012, yet still below 2008 pre-recession numbers. Arkansas income tax collections were lower than last year, but higher than budget analysts had projected.
California attributes its booming budget to a robust stock market and a dramatically improving economy. By June, the state had just 1,800 fewer jobs than its pre-recession peak.
Still, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has warned that the capital gains tax revenue that gave the state so much money is fleeting. In the 1990s and early 2000s, at the height of the Internet boom, the state spent much of those capital gains taxes on ongoing programs. When the money evaporated as the stock market cratered, California was left with billions in budget deficits. And even a $4 billion surplus looks small compared with the state’s $156 billion budget Brown signed last month.
“The idea that you’d take this little bitty surplus and go on this big spending spree strikes me as odd,” Brown told The Washington Post in an interview earlier this year. “I think that kind of ping pong budgeting, where first you ping and then you pong, makes no sense. And not only do I think it makes any sense, the vast majority of Californians don’t think it makes any sense.”
“There’s a cautionary tale” in relying on capital gains income, said H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the California Department of Finance. The tech bubble created “the beginnings of those multibillion-dollar budget deficits that in many respects we’ve just gotten around to closing.”
Kil Huh, director of the State and Local Fiscal Health Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said states face an especially acute danger when estimating capital gains tax revenue. “The capital gains portion of the personal income tax is one of the most difficult things to estimate or project correctly,” he said.
Many states are using their surplus dollars to rebuild rainy day funds sapped during the recession. California will sock away $1.6 billion this fiscal year, with more money to come in later years. Ohio’s rainy day account stood at just 89 cents when Gov. John Kasich (R) took office in 2011; today, it’s at $1.5 billion, the statutory limit. Indiana has saved $2 billion in reserve, though its $106 million surplus this year came from $150 million in cuts to programs like state colleges and universities, the Family and Social Services Administration and the Department of Correction.",summarize the following text: ,"Years after a recession hammered state budgets the recovery is once again bolstering personal and corporate incomes, and swelling state coffers beyond expectations

"The subject of redress and grievance thus functions here as a recapacitation of a debilitated body. To make my second and related point, then, I want to shift the registers of this conversation about “queer suicide” from pathologization versus normativization of sexual identity to questions of bodily capacity, debility, disability, precarity, and populations. This is not to dismiss these queer suicides but to ask what kinds of “slow deaths” have been ongoing that a suicide might represent an escape from. It is also to “slow” the act of suicide down — to offer a concomitant yet different temporality of relating to living and dying. Berlant moves us away from trauma or catastrophe, proposing that “slow death occupies the temporalities of the endemic” (756). Slow death occurs not within the timescale of the suicide or the epidemic but within “a zone of temporality . . . of ongoingness, getting by, and living on, where the structural inequalities are dispersed, the pacing of their experience intermittent, often in phenomena not prone to capture by a consciousness organized by archives of memorable impact” (759). In this nonlinear temporality, for it starts and stops, redoubles and leaps ahead, Berlant is not “defining a group of individuals merely afflicted with the same ailment, [rather] slow death describes populations marked out for wearing out” (760 – 61n20). That is, slow death is not about an orientation toward the death drive, nor is it morbid; rather, it is about the maintenance of living, the “ordinary work of living on” (761).
In the context of slow death, I ponder three things. First, what does it mean to proclaim “it gets better,” or “you get stronger”? Second, why is suicide constituted as the ultimate loss of life? Third, how can we connect these suicides to the theorization of debility and capacity? David Mitchell’s moving invocation of disability “not as exception, but the basis upon which a decent and just social order is founded,” hinges on a society that acknowledges, accepts, and even anticipates disability.9 This anticipatory disability is the dominant temporal frame of both disability rights activism (you are able- bodied only until you are disabled) as well as disability studies. As the queer disability theorist Robert McRuer writes, “It’s clear that we are haunted by the disability to come.”10 Disability is posited as the most common identity category because we will all belong to it someday, as McRuer’s comment implies. Yet, as David Mitchell and Sharon Snyder argue, disability is “reified as the true site of insufficiency.”11 But Berlant’s formulation of slow death implies that we might not (only) be haunted by the disability to come but also disavow the debility already here.
Berlant argues that “health itself can then be seen as a side effect of successful normativity” (765). Therefore, to honor the complexity of these suicides, they must be placed within the broader context of neoliberal demands for bodily capacity as well as the profitability of debility, both functioning as central routes through which finance capital seeks to sustain itself. In my current book project, “Affective Politics: States of Capacity and Debility,” I examine these heightened demands for bodily capacity and exceptionalized debility. Capacity and debility are seeming opposites generated by increasingly demanding neoliberal formulations of health, agency, and choice — what I call a “liberal eugenics of lifestyle programming” — that produce, along with biotechnologies and bioinformatics, population aggregates. Those “folded” into life are seen as more capacious or on the side of capacity, while those targeted for premature or slow death are figured as debility. Such an analysis re-poses the questions: which bodies are made to pay for “progress”? Which debilitated bodies can be reinvigorated for neoliberalism, and which cannot? In this regard, Savage’s project refigures queers, along with other bodies heretofore construed as excessive/erroneous, as being on the side of capacity, ensuring that queerness operates as a machine of regenerative productivity. Even though post- structuralist queer theory critically deploys registers of negativity (and increasingly negative affect) in reading practices primarily deconstructive in their orientation, such a figuration of queer theory has emerged from a homeostatic framework: queer theory is already also a machine of capacity in and after the cybernetic turn. Bioinformatics frames — in which bodies figure not as identities or subjects but as data — entail that there is no such thing as nonproductive excess but only emergent forms of new information.12 This revaluing of excess/debility is potent because, simply put, debility — slow death — is profitable for capitalism. In neoliberal, biomedical, and biotechnological terms, the body is always debilitated in relation to its ever- expanding potentiality.",summarize the following text: ,"The subject of redress and grievance functions here as a recapacitation of a debilitated body I want to shift the registers of this conversation about suicide from pathologization versus normativization to questions of bodily capacity, debility, disability, precarity, and populations This is not to dismiss these suicides but to ask what kinds of “slow deaths” have been ongoing that a suicide might represent an escape from.

"Any thoughtful reading of Beyond the Pleasure Principle amply confirms David Black’s conclusion: the properties of the death drive as postulated by Freud in 1922 bear no relationship to the drive theory of psychoanalysis because, as David Black notes with admirable economy, ‘The return of organic matter to the inorganic state does not make a demand on the mind for work; it happens reliably with or without the mind’s participation’. Similarly David Black points out the difficulties with an indirect route to the death drive originating in Freud’s earlier neuroscientific training as expressed in ‘A project for a scientific psychology’, which to my mind, in disagreement with David Black, is a minefield rather than a seed-bed of ideas. And one is relieved to find that he quite rightly rejects what he calls indirect affective roads to the death drive which reduce Freud’s motivation to his feelings at the time – World War I, the dangers to his sons Martin and Ernst, his weariness with life or, even and intriguingly, his feelings about the loss of Jung just before World War II. When coupled to his analysis of the subsequent development of the death drive as a metaphor for human destructiveness rather than as a biological reality, I think we are in a position to recognize with him that the death drive was in fact a detour. I think this is an important advance in our debates. It would certainly seem that we should stop thinking in terms of a death drive but directly in terms of destructiveness. We should stop teaching the death drive in our trainings. And we should recognize, with David Black, that the death drive was a detour of historical interest, but is no longer of real psychoanalytic interest. As David Black concludes, ‘The death drive, as such, probably merits no future in psychoanalytic thinking’. If we leave the distractions of the death drive behind us, we are then left with a clear set of problems to address around the psychology of human destructiveness. Our community is sharply divided on the question of human destructiveness. In particular, I am among those who disagree sharply with David Black’s view of the fundamental nature of violence, seeing rather that human beings have a demonstrable and fundamental capacity for violence analogous to the demonstrable and fundamental capacity for language. A capacity is, of course, very different from the fundamental or instinctual expression of violence. The many forms of expression of violence we can point to are no more fundamental to the biological organism than the exact language that we end up speaking. The origin of the precise expression of the universal human capacity for violence is social-developmental: a neonate is no more programmed to be born expressing envy than it is programmed to be born expressing English. This is the nature of the differences between us. How can we begin to synthesize such divergent views? To begin, I have never quite understood why some colleagues feel, as David Black says, that ‘there is a natural tendency among decent people to drift towards underestimating the pervasiveness of our cruelty, malice, hatred, envy and violence, our capacity to revel in destructiveness or be terrified by fears of annihilation’. Rather it has always seemed to me, looking in from outside the Kleinian frame, that such feelings have been overemphasized rather than under-emphasized. I’ve often wondered whether the real tendency among decent people is to be far more anxious about dealing with our defences against taking in love while being relatively more familiar and therefore more comfortable with the painful feelings of hate (Suttie 1988). David Black describes this duality of approaches to the psyche well by pointing out the possible significance of the duality of drives in drive theory. ‘There are a broad Yes and No in human lives, however entangled they may be in the case of particular motives.’ As such we might say that some clinicians align themselves on the side of Yes while others align themselves on the side of No. Let us see if we can indicate a way forward out this radical but, I believe, superficial polarization. Consider evolutionary approaches to understanding human violence alluded to by David Black. These seductive arguments are always with us and it is easy to understand their appeal: evolutionary arguments can explain anything. This is as true of the sociobiology of 20 years ago as it is of its current reincarnation as evolutionary psychology. The disputes here are heated and rightly so (Wilson 1976; Lewin 1976; Cooke et al. 1976).When Thornhill and Palmer (2000) can succeed in persuading an élite academic publisher to publish their book arguing that rape exists because it confers evolutionary advantage, we know that biological determinism is alive and well in theWest. Nor are the attractions of being able to explain anything in evolutionary terms confined to the right wing of the political spectrum. Kohn (1999) has argued that sociobiology has much too much potential to be left to the sociobiologists.",summarize the following text: ,"the properties of the death drive bear no relationship to the drive theory of psychoanalysis because The return of organic matter to the inorganic state does not make a demand on the mind for work; it happens reliably with or without the mind’s participation’ the death drive was in fact a detour we should stop thinking in terms of a death drive but directly in terms of destructiveness should stop teaching the death drive in our trainings. And we should recognize, with Black, that the death drive was a detour of historical interest, but is no longer of real psychoanalytic interest. The death drive, as such, probably merits no future in psychoanalytic thinking’ we are then left with a clear set of problems to address around the psychology of human destructiveness human beings have a demonstrable and fundamental capacity for violence A capacity is, of course, very different from the fundamental or instinctual expression of violence I have never quite understood why colleagues feel there is a natural tendency among people to drift towards cruelty, malice and violence evolutionary approaches can explain anything."
"Borrowing from its English forebears, the United States once had a form of punishment called civil death. Civil death extinguished most civil rights of a person convicted of a crime and largely put that person outside the law’s protection. Civil death as an institution faded away in the middle of the twentieth century. Policymakers recognized that almost all convicted persons eventually rejoin society, and therefore, it was wise and fair to allow them to participate in society with some measure of equality.
This Article proposes that civil death has surreptitiously reemerged. It no longer exists under that name, but effectually a new civil death is meted out to persons convicted of crimes in the form of a substantial and permanent change in legal status, operationalized by a network of collateral consequences. A person convicted of a crime, whether misdemeanor or felony, 1 may be subject to disenfranchisement 2 (or deportation if a noncitizen 3), criminal registration and community notification requirements, 4 and the ineligibility to live, work, or be present in a particular location. 5 Some are not allowed to live outside of civil confinement at all. 6 In addition, the person may be subject to occupational debarment 7 or ineligibility to establish or maintain family relations. 8 While the entire array of collateral consequences may not apply to any given person, the State is always able to add new disabilities or to extend existing limitations. As a practical matter, every criminal sentence contains the following unwritten term:
The law regards you as having a “shattered character.” 9 Therefore, in addition to any incarceration or fine, you are subject to legal restrictions and limitations on your civil rights, conduct, employment, residence, and relationships. For the rest of your life, the United States and any State or locaity where you travel or reside may impose, at any time, additional restrictions and limitations they deem warranted. Their power to do so is limited only by their reasonable discretion. They may also require you to pay the expense of these restrictions and limitations.
For many people convicted of crimes, the most severe and long-lasting effect of conviction is not imprisonment or fine. Rather, it is being subjected to collateral consequences involving the actual or potential loss of civil rights, parental rights, public benefits, and employment opportunities.
The magnitude of the problem is greater than ever. The commonly used term “mass incarceration” implies that the most typical tool of the criminal justice system is imprisonment. Indeed, there are two million people in American prisons and jails, a huge number, but one which is dwarfed by the six-and-a-half million or so on probation or parole10 and the tens of millions in free society with criminal records. 11 The vast majority of people who have been convicted of crimes are not currently in prison. However, because of their criminal records, they remain subject to governmental regulation of various aspects of their lives and concomitant imposition of benefits and burdens. People convicted of crimes are not subject to just one collateral consequence, or even a handful. Instead, hundreds and sometimes thousands of such consequences apply under federal and state constitutional provisions, statutes, administrative regulations, and ordinances.12 As one Ohio court recognized in 1848, “[D]isabilities . . . imposed upon the convict” are “part of the punishment, and in many cases the most important part.” 13
As practically important as collateral consequences are, in a line of cases examining individual restrictions, the Court has held they are subject to extremely limited constitutional regulation. 14 Because collateral¶ consequences are deemed to be something other than criminal sanctions, they can generally be applied without notice from the court or defense counsel at the time of a guilty plea.15 Moreover, new ones can be imposed retroactively after plea bargains have been made and sentences fully satisfied.16
There is a little-noticed but significant countertradition. In Weems v. United States 17 and Trop v. Dulles, 18 the Supreme Court found punishments cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment in part because of burdensome and systematic collateral consequences. 19 In addition, alongside cases holding that particular collateral consequences were not punishment, other Supreme Court decisions have shaped the right to jury trial, right to counsel, and other aspects of criminal procedure in light of the fact that collateral consequences are at stake in criminal judgments.
The Court’s cases, then, simultaneously suggest that individual collateral consequences are not punishment, but that systematic loss of legal status in the form of actual or potential subjection to an interlocking system of collateral consequences is punishment. This paradox can be reconciled by understanding the degradation of a convict’s legal status to be a unitary punishment, the new civil death.

"Third, it is difficult to understand why mere compensation destroys acts of generosity or blots out the ability of persons to give of themselves for the good. Fire fi ghters, police, and other rescue workers are deemed heroic for giving of themselves for the good and are yet paid for their labor and risk taking. Professors may go beyond their offi cial duties to help students out of generosity, yet still collect a paycheck. Professionals, who work in the nonprofi t sector of the economy are often lauded for having generously given of themselves to serve others still receive compensation. Elementary school teachers are held up as examples of individuals who have forgone potentially more profi table careers so as to teach, still sign contracts, and engage in collective bargaining over wages and working conditions. In the United States, the value of money and goods that persons generously donate to charitable organizations may usually be deducted from one’s income, prior to calculating the amount of federal income tax owed. This valuable deduction is designed to encourage people to be generous. (Americans gave more than 300 billion dollars to charity in 2007. 11 ) Churches may extend a contract for food service to a member of the parish in need of work. Plumbers may take the time carefully to explain how the repair was performed, even while writing out the bill. A physician may waive part of his fee when treating needy patients, accepting less of a fi nancial payment than he is entitled.
Generosity, the choice to give of oneself for the good of others, in many fashions and often without much fanfare, finds its way into the marketplace of goods and services. Thus, it is highly implausible to conclude that “ Each of these kinds of markets, by its very nature , would entail the dissolution of the ethic of gifting ” (emphasis added, 599). The market by its very nature does not destroy generosity, altruism, or gift giving. Such values can and are brought routinely into the market. Regarding compensated organ donation: how is a grieving family any less generous, if they agree to accept compensation for donating the organs of a deceased loved one? Such compensated donations will likely save many lives. Fourth, the persistent reference to organ donation as an “ altruistic gift ” embedded within the “ ethic of generosity ” may be more lofty rhetoric than empirical reality. Presumably many organ donations are fully altruistically motivated; however, it is difficult to know what percentage falls squarely into this category, without any private negotiation for benefits or implicit quid pro quo. Human motivations are complex, multifaceted, and not always fully acknowledged, even to oneself. It is, therefore, diffi cult fully to illuminate a donor’s or family’s actual motivations.
Requiring strict adherence to an ethic of generosity would rule out many donations. Most living organ donations are to family members or close friends, for example. Such donations might be motivated by love or beneficence or, perhaps, by family loyalty, gratitude, guilt, or avoidance of the shame of failing to donate. For these donors, their willingness to donate stems from their relationship with the particular patient and may not be fully altruistically motivated, much less embedded within an ethic of generosity. Some individuals stand to be financially supported by others who are in need of an organ transplant. Perhaps by donating a kidney to his father Joe saves the life of the man who will be financing his small business and who has the expertise to help him think through his long-term business plans. Or, perhaps, Anna believes that donating an organ to her niece, something she had good reason to do anyway, will also increase the likelihood that her uncle Alexei will leave her a generous inheritance in his will. Should we refuse to let Joe save his father or Anna save her niece simply because their motives may be less than purely altruistic? Families have put forth children as living donors, with parents consenting on behalf of those children. In Hart v. Brown (1972) , the court ruled that the parents of twin girls could consent on behalf of one twin to have a kidney removed and transplanted into her sister. 12 Couples have utilized in vitro fertilization with genetic testing and embryo wastage, so as to select embryos for implantation, who once born are destined to become a tissue donor for an already existing sibling ( Sheldon and Wilkinson, 2004 ). The donor’s altruism is nonexistent in such cases. Should these types of organ and tissue transfers be legally forbidden? Or should decisions regarding the best interests of children be left up to parents and families, with medical questions regarding whether to perform the transplant presented to surgical professionals and hospital administrations? It is unclear why government bureaucrats, state legislators, and bioethicists are better placed to make such judgments.",summarize the following text: ,"it is difficult to understand why mere compensation destroys acts of generosity or blots out the ability of persons to give of themselves for the good.

"Devore, in fact, has it exactly backwards: We have to prepare for the real enemy, and it’s not China. The real and immediate enemy is a network of Islamic radicals determined to destabilize the world and wreck havoc and destruction on America and the West. Yet, China is what preoccupies the Weekly Standard’s Noonan, Goldfarb and indeed, most conservative defense hawks. To be sure, China is a potential military threat. The United States certainly should maintain military superiority over China; and we certainly should guarantee the independence of Taiwan. But the Right’s obsession with a hypothetical and distant Chinese military threat is seriously misplaced and inappropriate — especially given the wartime exigencies of today. American Soldiers and Marines are being targeted and killed, after all, not by China, but by Islamic radicals in Iraq and Afghanistan. And it is this global war against the Islamists — and not a distant, hypothetical war with China — that is the future of warfare. It’s a future involving lots of messy asymmetric fights in which American troops are integral to stability, security, and gradual, long-term democratization. It is not, however, a future that conservatives like or wish to accept. Conservatives don’t like messy asymmetric fights which involve counterinsurgency and nation building: because to many on the Right, that’s not “real war.” That’s not the role and purpose of the U.S. military. The Right dreams or imagines, instead, of a conventional “big war” with China. Dream on, because it ain’t gonna happen, not in our lifetime anyhow. The Chinese are interested in making money, not war. Their increasing military prowess is a natural and inevitable reflection of their growing economic strength and vitality. Indeed, as a country modernizes and develops, so, too, does its military. Again, I’m not suggesting that we let our guard down with China. I’m simply saying that we view the potential Chinese military threat in context and with perspective and that we plan and budget accordingly. Unfortunately, the Right’s misplaced obsession with China has deleterious real-world consequences. It causes conservatives to too often give short shrift to the existential Jihadist threat that now confronts us, and too little attention to the war we are now fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. What’s more, because the Right has yet to come to terms with the nature of 21st irregular asymmetric warfare, it has been AWOL and ineffective in the defense budget battles of recent years. For example, when President Obama and Defense Secretary Robert Gates last year pushed dramatic defense budget cuts in the name of canceling “Cold War weapon systems,” most conservatives were flummoxed and stymied. They rightly sensed that eliminating some of our most advanced weapon systems was a bad idea. However, conservatives also realized that the world and warfare had changed, and that defense budget reform might well be necessary. Conventional set-piece battles, after all, are largely a thing of the past. Except that they’re not, because in the minds of conservative hawks, the Chinese military threat is always looming.  Thus, the Right fell back on old and dated Cold War modes of analysis, lamenting the loss of aircraft like the F-22 — even though the F-22 has not been used in either Iraq or Afghanistan, and even though modern-day conflicts are inherently land-based and ground-force intensive. My point is not that we don’t need any more F-22s, because we might. My point is that conservatives should focus their intellectual and rhetorical firepower on more relevant and urgent military priorities like the need for ground-force modernization, a new Army combat vehicle, and networking our Army and Marine Corps with state-of-the-art communication capabilities. But the sad reality is that most conservative defense hawks — and certainly most conservative politicians and elected officials — haven’t a clue about U.S. military requirements. And they are especially clueless about the needs of our ground-force Soldiers and Marines. That’s why conservatives last year lost the defense budget battle; and that’s why they’re still losing and losing badly: because they have yet to come to terms with new geostrategic and military realities. They’re stuck in a Cold War time warp and are mistakenly focused on China. But the Chinese are eager to sell us commercial goods; they are not eager to destroy our cities and our people. The same cannot be said, however, of the Jihadists who plan and plot for our destruction. You’d think that nine years after the terrorist attacks on the Pentagon and World Trade Center, and with wars still raging in Iraq and Afghanistan, conservatives would understand this. But alas, you would be wrong. The Right still doesn’t get it. But they should and they must. The fate of American national security, and the survival of our Soldiers and Marines, hangs in the balance. Time to modernize our thinking. Now.",summarize the following text: ,"China is what preoccupies conservative defense hawks. But the Right’s obsession with a hypothetical and distant Chinese military threat is seriously misplaced and inappropriate — especially given the wartime exigencies of today. American Soldiers and Marines are being targeted and killed, after all, not by China, The Right dreams of a conventional “big war” with China. Dream on, because it ain’t gonna happen, not in our lifetime anyhow. The Chinese are interested in making money, not war. Their increasing military prowess is a natural and inevitable reflection of their growing economic strength and vitality. Indeed, as a country modernizes and develops, so, too, does its military . in the minds of conservative hawks, the Chinese military threat is always looming. They’re stuck in a Cold War time warp and are mistakenly focused on China. But the Chinese are eager to sell us commercial goods; they are not eager to destroy our cities and our people"
"Though Black Skin, White Masks is a founda- tional text for reconfiguring psychoanalysis to ac- count for race, Fanon, like Freud, takes the male as the norm. For the exemplary colonized subject, Fanon uses the term le noir 'the black man.' This masculine ""universal"" refers not to humankind gen- erally, however, but to actual men-since Fanon describes these colonized subjects as studying in Paris, lusting after white women, and competing with white men for intellectual recognition. The French-educated Martinican who appropriates the superiority of the colonizing culture by ostenta- tiously wielding proper French is, by assumption, male: ""When he marries, his wife will be aware that she is marrying a joke"" 'marie, sa femme saura qu'elle epouse une histoire' (25; 39). That Fanon's""universal"" subject describes the colonized male in particular indicates that racial identities intersect with sexual difference. Fanon does not ignore sex- ual difference altogether, but he explores sexual- ity's role in constructing race only through rigid categories of gender. In Black Skin, White Masks, women are consid- ered as subjects almost exclusively in terms of their sexual relationships with men; feminine de- sire is thus defined as an overly literal and limited (hetero)sexuality. But though feminine subjectivity clearly deserves broader description, the dimen- sions of its confinement within Black Skin, White Masks indicate the architecture of raced masculin- ity and femininity in the colonial context. So while it is not surprising that Fanon, writing in the early fifties, takes the masculine as the norm, it is neces- sary not only to posit alternative representations of femininity but also to consider how his account of normative raced masculinity depends on the pro- duction or exclusion of femininities. By examining the role of gender in Black Skin, White Masks, I aim to broaden Fanon's outline of black women's subjectivity and to work toward delineating the in- terdependence of race and gender. Although they may emanate from a common construction of oth- erness in psychoanalytic discourses,6 racial differ- ence and sexual difference intersect and interact in contextually variable ways that preclude separate or determinist description.7 Relying on feminist psychoanalytic theory as a model for revising the discourse of psychoanalysis from within, I hope to review Fanon's construction of gender while illu- minating the contributions of his psychoanalytic framework of racial identity. Fanon's almost mythical significance for post- colonial theorists and, more recently, for others gesturing toward multicultural contexts nearly fore- stalls a gender critique of Black Skin, White Masks. In an article tracing Fanon's recuperation as a ""global theorist,"" Gates notes that Fanon is mobi- lized as an ""ethnographic construct"" and is used as ""both totem and text"" to model a ""unified theory of oppression"" (459, 457, 470). Figuring Fanon as transcultural and transhistorical means that ""in the course of an appeal for the specificity of the Other, we discover that [Fanon as the] global theorist of alterity is emptied of his own specificity"" (459). These invocations do not lead to critical analyses of his work but make the colonial paradigm the ""last bastion for the project, and dream, of global the- ory"" (469-70). According to Gates, pressing Fanon into the service of a ""global theory"" of colonialism produces either a ""sentimental romance of alterity"" complete with a utopian vision of fully achieved in- dependence from the colonial relation or a conception of that relation as a closed, inescapable system. For Gates, these incompatible positions structure the central conflict within colonial discourse the- ory: the tension between utopian narratives of liber- ation and deterministic models of subject formation and discourse formation. To unlock this binary, Gates proposes a more grounded approach that would ""historicize"" Fanon through biographical critique. Gates would weigh, for example, reports that Fanon did not identify with and even found distasteful the common people of the cultures he championed theoretically and politically. This recourse to the ""factual"" authority of biog- raphy may demythologize the man but does not disprove his theory or resolve the dilemmas of co- lonial discourse analysis. Fanon's alienation from the local and the ""low"" is in fact the subject of Black Skin, White Masks; the dialectic between solidarity with and alienation from the colonized population is integral to his analysis of the colo- nially educated black man's psychology. Rather than historicize Fanon, I want to challenge post- colonialism's uses of him and to encourage a deeper engagement with issues of gender-not to consti- tute a better ""unified theory of oppression"" (Gates 470) but to question the dominant practice of ""separate but equal"" psychoanalytic discourses of race and gender.",summarize the following text: ,"White Masks is a founda- tional text for reconfiguring psychoanalysis to ac- count for race, Fanon, like Freud, takes the male as the norm For the exemplary colonized subject, Fanon uses the term le noir 'the black man.

"The U.S. needs more highly skilled workers, but an arbitrary quota prevents them from coming here. Seldom has it been so clear that U.S. immigration policy is counterproductive to U.S. interests as it was on Monday. That's the day companies began filing applications for high-skilled foreign workers -and its also the day the quota was filled. Technology companies and other businesses filed more than 65,000 petitions requesting H-1b visas for their employees, easily surpassing the annual 65,000 quota. With the demand for skilled workers clearly exceeding the arbitrary limit, Congress should raise the cap so fewer U.S. companies have to turn to outsourcing and more skilled people can work in the United States. H-1B workers, typically Indian and Chinese people with technological degrees, are promised a prevailing wage. Their employers, mostly technology companies, have to attest that they have not displaced U.S. workers if more than 15% of their workforce is here on H-1b status. Employer demands for an increase in the H1-B quota (and the quota itself) have fluctuated with the economy. During the Dot.com bubble, pressure to increase the cap was almost constant. In the years since, the pressure has receded, and the U.S. decreased to 65,000-from 195,000-the number of foreign workers it accepts on H1-B visas. Now pressure to allow more workers into the U.S. on H1-B status is increasing again. More skilled immigrants would be able to remain in the U.S. if Congress allowed the H1-b cap to fluctuate with the market. Strictly enforcing the prevailing wage and other requirements, while also encouraging U.S. students to pursue science, would also ensure that Americans can participate in these dynamic job markets. And-as with immigration policy generally -H1b visa changes must be approached comprehensively. The H1-B is a three year, temporary visa that can be renewed only once. Visa holders who seek to become lawful permanent residents face enormous backlogs that will only grow if more H1-B visa holders who seek to become lawful permanent residents face enormous backlogs that will only grow if more H1-B visas are granted. Ideally, an increase in H1-B visa quotas would be accompanied by an increase in the quota for green cards. Skilled workers are also more likely to stay and contribute to the U.S. economy if their immediate families can join them here; currently, family members also face severe backlogs. President Bush appears to recognize the importance of skilled labor to the U.S. economy. ""It makes no sense to say to a young scientist from India,"" You can't come here to America to help this company develop technologies that help us deal with our problems,"" he said in January. And, he might have added, by coming to America, they also help the U.S. Economy stay competitive.
Prizes work --- jumpstart engineering and tech-based innovations.
Kalil 06 - Special Assistant to the Chancellor for Science and Technology at UC Berkeley [THOMAS KALIL (Senior Fellow with the Center for American Progress & Former Deputy Assistant to President Clinton for Technology and Economic Policy), “Prizes for Technological Innovation,” The Hamilton Project, The Brookings Institution, Discussion Paper 2006-08, December 2006]
Under certain circumstances, inducement prizes may act as a useful complement to grants and contracts as a way to encourage technological innovation. The government can establish a goal without determining who is in the best position to reach the goal or what the most promising technical approach is. The government only pays the prize money if someone is successful, and may be able to leverage additional funding from foundations, philanthropists, and contestants who value the reputational benefits of winning the competition. Prizes can also generate public excitement and enthusiasm for science and technology, and encourage more young people to pursue careers in science, engineering, or technology-based entrepreneurship.
This paper has suggested some useful starting points for inducement prizes and AMCs in a number of areas, including space exploration, vaccines, African agriculture, reducing GHG emissions, and education. The president and Congress could direct agencies to identify other areas where prize competitions are likely to be cost effective. Congress could give additional agencies the authority they need to sponsor prizes, and be prepared to consider expanding the magnitude of prizes as our understanding of this policy tool develops.
A broad range of historical examples and other empirical evidence suggests that well-designed prizes work. Although the optimal level of investment in prizes is not clear, it is surely much larger than the government’s current investment, which is currently limited to DARPA’s recently completed two-million-dollar Grand Challenge for autonomous ground vehicles, and NASA’s Centennial Challenge program. We still have much to learn about the strengths and limitations of prizes, but the time to start additional experiments_old is now.

"Indian casinos constitute 40% of the American gaming market. For a large number of American Indian nations, Indian gaming has been a key resource in facilitating tribal self-governance and self-determination. Approximately 237 tribes operate 442 Indian gaming facilities in the United States.1 Given the importance of Indian gaming to tribal governments, Congress must consider how online gaming will affect Indian tribes and insure that any federal laws enacted to regulate Internet gaming give Indian tribes a fair opportunity to share in the Internet gaming boom. The Supreme Court recognized that tribes had inherent powers to regulate gaming on their own lands in California v. Cabazon Band of Missions Indians2 in 1987. That decision produced a nationwide debate on Indian gaming that was largely resolved the next year when President Ronald Reagan signed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act into law. The Reagan administration was strongly supportive of Indian gaming even before the Cabazon decision. The Reagan Administration believed that revenues from Indian gaming could increase tribal self-sufficiency and reduce tribal dependence on federal appropriations. When it enacted IGRA, Congress recognized the exclusive right of tribes to regulate gaming on their lands and sought to promote tribal economic development, self-sufficiency and strong self government.3 Moreover, Congress refused to privatize the benefits of Indian gaming. It mandated in IGRA that gaming revenues must be used primarily for public purposes, naming five authorized uses: “(i) to fund tribal government operations or programs; (ii) to provide for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members; (iii) to promote tribal economic development; (iv) to donate to charitable organizations; or (v) to help fund operations of local government agencies.”4 The legal regime set forth in IGRA has allowed many tribes to prosper. The Reagan Administration’s hopes for Indian gaming have been realized, probably beyond their wildest expectations. Indian gaming has been the greatest economic engine on Indian reservations that the United States has ever seen. From 1998 to 2010, Indian Gaming grossed more than $246.2 billion nationwide.5 Consistent with the purposes specified by Congress, most of these have been used to fund tribal operations and promote the economic development and welfare of tribes and Indian people. For instance, according to the National Indian Gaming Association’s (NIGA) Economic Impact Report for 2009, 237 Indian tribes in 28 states had used Indian gaming to create new jobs, fund essential government services and rebuild communities. In 2009 tribal governments generated $26.2 billion gross revenue from gaming alone - 20% of that net revenue was dedicated to education, children and elders, culture and charity, 19% to economic development, 17% to health care, 17% to police and fire protection, 16% towards infrastructure and 11% towards housing.6 While tribal revenues allocation plans that provide for per capita payments to individual tribal members have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior and have earned a great deal of press attention, most of these payments have done little more than to increase household income and lift some Indian citizens out of poverty. In addition to gaming revenues, tribes generated $3.2 billion in gross revenue from related hospitality and entertainment services such as resorts and entertainment complexes.7 As of 2009, tribal governments had directly or indirectly generated 628,000 jobs nationwide for American Indians and others.8 As a result of gaming, tribes have experienced extensive economic development and built strong governmental infrastructures. In sum, gaming has assisted in producing strong tribal governmental infrastructures. Tribal gaming revenues have been a boon to the federal government as well. In light of the federal government’s trust responsibility to the tribes, it would likely have had to spend more on federal Indian programs in the absence of Indian gaming. In addition, Indian gaming revenues have produced tax revenues for the federal government, both directly and indirectly, and revenue shares for state governments. Although predictions are difficult, especially about the future, Internet gaming poses some magnitude of threat to the brick and mortar casino industry, including tribal casinos. Federal policy toward Internet gaming going forward should recognize the significant risk to the stable revenue stream upon which many tribes have been able to depend. Under the worst case scenario, a shift in the market for gaming away from land-based casinos and toward Internet gaming could vastly increase revenues to private and even off-shore Internet gaming companies and decrease tribal governmental revenues, plunging some tribal nations back into poverty. Federal policy must recognize and seek to mitigate this risk, so as to preserve gaming as a viable means of raising governmental resources for tribal governments.",summarize the following text: ,"Indian casinos constitute 40% of the American gaming market.

"Years after a recession hammered state budgets, forcing across-the-board cuts to programs and services, the economic recovery is once again bolstering personal and corporate incomes, and swelling state coffers beyond expectations.
Initial reports show many states ended Fiscal Year 2014 with budget surpluses, thanks to growing tax revenue collections. In some cases, states have hundreds of millions or billions of dollars to spend. Other states pulled in just a few million dollars over the break-even point. But even the smallest surplus is better than the tide of red ink that washed over states during the depths of the recession.
California ended the fiscal year with $1.9 billion left over in its state general fund, Controller John Chiang (D) said last week, the first time the general fund ended with a positive cash balance since 2007, the year before the recession began. The state Department of Finance has projected a $4.2 billion surplus for Fiscal Year 2014-2015, which began July 1.
Ohio netted an $800 million surplus, its fourth straight year of black ink. New Hampshire ended the fiscal year $5.6 million over budget. South Dakota notched its third straight surplus. Indiana, Arkansas and Georgia have all reported nine-figure surpluses just days after the fiscal year ended.
The surpluses, however, aren’t solely positive news. Tax collections in many states are lower than they were last year, when wealthy taxpayers took personal income early in hopes of avoiding the fallout from the fiscal cliff. That gave states an artificial boost in revenue during the last fiscal year, and forced budget analysts in most states to plan for lower revenues the following year.
“When the federal tax laws changed at the end of 2012, there was a significant shift in income out of calendar year 2013 into calendar year 2012,” said Tim Keen, director of Ohio’s Office of Budget and Management. “We spent a lot of time when we made our revenue estimates considering that fact.”
Ohio took in less in the 2013-2014 Fiscal Year than it did over the previous year, but the state still ran a surplus. “We tried to be conservative to make sure our estimates were achievable, and they turned out to be,” Keen said.
Arkansas collected less in sales tax and income tax than in Fiscal Year 2012-2013, but still came in $174 million above projections. New Hampshire’s budget surplus was actually below the $26 million budget analysts had projected. Georgia reported collecting $944 million in corporate tax revenues over the fiscal year after pulling in just $590 million in 2012, yet still below 2008 pre-recession numbers. Arkansas income tax collections were lower than last year, but higher than budget analysts had projected.
California attributes its booming budget to a robust stock market and a dramatically improving economy. By June, the state had just 1,800 fewer jobs than its pre-recession peak.
Still, Gov. Jerry Brown (D) has warned that the capital gains tax revenue that gave the state so much money is fleeting. In the 1990s and early 2000s, at the height of the Internet boom, the state spent much of those capital gains taxes on ongoing programs. When the money evaporated as the stock market cratered, California was left with billions in budget deficits. And even a $4 billion surplus looks small compared with the state’s $156 billion budget Brown signed last month.
“The idea that you’d take this little bitty surplus and go on this big spending spree strikes me as odd,” Brown told The Washington Post in an interview earlier this year. “I think that kind of ping pong budgeting, where first you ping and then you pong, makes no sense. And not only do I think it makes any sense, the vast majority of Californians don’t think it makes any sense.”
“There’s a cautionary tale” in relying on capital gains income, said H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the California Department of Finance. The tech bubble created “the beginnings of those multibillion-dollar budget deficits that in many respects we’ve just gotten around to closing.”
Kil Huh, director of the State and Local Fiscal Health Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts, said states face an especially acute danger when estimating capital gains tax revenue. “The capital gains portion of the personal income tax is one of the most difficult things to estimate or project correctly,” he said.
Many states are using their surplus dollars to rebuild rainy day funds sapped during the recession. California will sock away $1.6 billion this fiscal year, with more money to come in later years. Ohio’s rainy day account stood at just 89 cents when Gov. John Kasich (R) took office in 2011; today, it’s at $1.5 billion, the statutory limit. Indiana has saved $2 billion in reserve, though its $106 million surplus this year came from $150 million in cuts to programs like state colleges and universities, the Family and Social Services Administration and the Department of Correction.",summarize the following text: ,"Years after a recession hammered state budgets the recovery is once again bolstering personal and corporate incomes, and swelling state coffers beyond expectations

"But Professor Peter Cowan, of Melbourne's St Vincent's Hospital, says progress in xenotransplantation has accelerated over the past five years, with 2014 revealing the results of some key studies. ""The reason there's a bit of action going on at the moment is that pancreatic islet transplantation has now entered the clinical trial stage,"" he said. A huge hurdle for xenotransplantation has been the possibility of infectious agents passing from pigs to humans, especially porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs). Last year, New Zealand researchers reported a small clinical trial where pig islet cells were transplanted into people with diabetes. The specially housed pigs were not genetically modified and were rigorously screened for micro-organisms. Professor Cowan said that this trial, and others, had found no evidence of PERVs or any other infections in the people who were treated. ""The PERV issue has almost become a non-issue now,"" he said. ""It's been impossible to show that PERV infection will be a problem. Also, the screening of the pigs has improved enormously so you can now selectively breed pigs that are so-called low or non-transmitters of PERV."" Xenotransplantation is one of a number of possible approaches to overcoming the shortage of human tissues and organs available for transplants. Melbourne has a strong history of xenotransplantation research over 25 years, and Professor Cowan's group at St Vincent's and another based at Austin Health are still strong contributors to the field. Progress in most areas of research has its highs and lows. But after the heady days of the 1990s, xenotransplantation hit a perfect storm of negative issues around the turn of the millennium. Fear of PERVS exploded around 2000, as momentum in the field grew and xenotransplantation seemed closer to reality. When this fear was combined with the cost and difficulty of genetic engineering of pigs to avoid rapid rejection, xenotransplantation seemed too risky a venture for governments and investors. At the same time, stem cell research, in some ways a competing technology, hit the headlines as a potential way of supplying tissues and organs. ""I think most of the companies left the field [of xenotransplantation] so a lot of the support dropped, the financial support, the research support. It was difficult to continue to research at that time,"" Professor Cowan said. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council imposed a five-year moratorium on clinical xenotransplantation in 2004, but this was lifted in 2009 under strict conditions. Associate Professor Bruce Loveland, now at the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, was previously the head of an Austin team that worked in the field. He thinks xenotransplantation can still contribute to the shortage of tissues for transplant. ""If you look at the options for patients now compared to 10 years ago, 20 years ago, the options are much better than they were, but there are still big gaps. So the interest in xenotransplantation is there."" He noted a clinical program at St Vincent's was also researching human islet cell transplants for people with diabetes. But even if ultimately successful, the lack of availability of human islet cells underscored the interest in islet cells from pigs. Another researcher at University of Melbourne at Austin Health, Mauro Sandrin, said that although there had been little recent public focus on xenotransplantation, the science and technologies had progressed, with cloning of animals now faster, cheaper and more precise. ""The time from cloning Dolly the sheep [the first animal cloned in 1996] to cloning a pig was six or seven years, or more. Now, if you Google 'cloning of pigs' there are stacks of articles. Professor Sandrin said the human body would usually reject a pig organ in minutes, a reaction called hyperacute rejection, but the technologies were now at a point where a pig heart transplant could keep a monkey alive for months. ""Progress has been made in clinical models where we've got life-supporting kidneys going out beyond a year, life-supporting pancreatic islets going out beyond a year with immunosuppressive protocols that are probably clinically applicable [to humans]."" To date, a pig-to-human transplant of living organs or cells has not been performed in Australia, but if researchers could justify using pig transplants and meet the regulations, xenotransplantation could go ahead. Professor Cowan, who is also president-elect of the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA), says the World Health Organisation and the IXA have kept an eye on progress and have re-visited the guidelines for islet cell xenotransplantation to ensure the field is regulated. He said there were few recent studies about attitudes to xenotransplantation, although pig (and cow) heart valves have been used routinely to repair human hearts for many years. ""I think very few people would think twice about getting a pig heart valve. If you told them that this is going to work better than a mechanical valve, then they're going to take it.""",summarize the following text: ,"progress in xenotransplantation has accelerated over the past five years pancreatic islet transplantation has now entered the clinical trial stage huge hurdle for xenotransplantation has been the possibility of infectious agents passing especially PERVs Last year islet cells were transplanted were not genetically modified  no evidence of PERVs or any other infections in the people who were treated.

"Third reason. In our techno-scientifico-militaro-diplomatic incompetence, we may consider ourselves, however, as competent as others to deal with a phenomenon whose essential feature is that of being fabulously textual, through and through. Nuclear weaponry depends, more than any weaponry in the past, it seems, upon structures of information and communication, structures of language, including non-vocalizable language, structures of codes and graphic decoding. But the phenomenon is fabulously textual also to the extent that, for the moment, a nuclear war has not taken place: one can only talk and write about it. You will say, perhaps: but it is not the first time; the other wars, too, so long as they hadn’t taken place, were only talked about and written about. And as to the fright of imaginary anticipation, what might prove that a European in the period following the war of 1870 might not have been more terrified by the ""technological"" image of the bombings and exterminations of the Second World War (even supposing he had been able to form such an image) than we are by the image we can construct for ourselves of a nuclear war? The logic of this argument is not devoid of value, especially if one is thinking about a limited and ""clean"" nuclear war. But it loses its value in the face of the hypothesis of a total nuclear war, which, as a hypothesis, or, if you prefer, as a fantasy, or phantasm, conditions every discourse and all strategies. Unlike the other wars, which have all been preceded by wars of more or less the same type in human memory (and gunpowder did not mark a radical break in this respect), nuclear war has no precedent. It has never occurred, itself; it is a non-event. The explosion of American bombs in 1945 ended a ""classical,"" conventional war; it did not set off a nuclear war. The terrifying reality of the nuclear conflict can only be the signified referent, never the real referent (present or past) of a discourse or a text. At least today apparently. And that sets us to thinking about today, our day, the presence of this present in and through that fabulous textuality. Better than ever and more than ever. The growing multiplication of the discourse-indeed, of the literature- on this subject may constitute a process of fearful domestication, the anticipatory assimilation of that unanticipatable entirely-other. For the moment, today, one may say that a non-localizable nuclear war has not occurred; it has existence only through what is said of it, only where it is talked about. Some might call it a fable, then, a pure invention: in the sense in which it is said that a myth, an image, a fiction, a utopia, a rhetorical figure, a fantasy, a phantasm, are inventions. It may also be called a speculation, even a fabulous specularization. The breaking of the mirror would be, finally, through an act of language, the very occurrence of nuclear war. Who can swear that our unconscious is not expecting this? dreaming of it, desiring it? You will perhaps find it shocking to find the nuclear issue reduced to a fable. But then I haven’t said simply that. I have recalled that a nuclear war is for the time being a fable, that is, something one can only talk about. But who can fail to recognize the massive ""reality"" of nuclear weaponry and of the terrifying forces of destruction that are being stockpiled and capitalized everywhere, that are coming to constitute the very movement of capitalization. One has to distinguish between this ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fiction of war. But, and this would perhaps be the imperative of a nuclear criticism, one must also be careful to interpret critically this critical or diacritical distinction. For the ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fable of nuclear war are perhaps distinct, but they are not two separate things. It is the war (in other words the fable) that triggers this fabulous war effort, this senseless capitalization of sophisticated weaponry, this speed race in search of speed, this crazy precipitation which, through techno-science, through all the techno-scientific inventiveness that it motivates, structures not only the army, diplomacy, politics, but the whole of the human socius today, everything that is named by the old words culture, civilization, Bildung, schole, paideia. ""Reality,"" let’s say the encompassing institution of the nuclear age, is constructed by the fable, on the basis of an event that has never happened (except in fantasy, and that is not nothing at all),* an event of which one can only speak, an event whose advent remains an invention by men (in all the senses of the word ""invention"") or which, rather, remains to be invented.

"In the 1950s attention turned to harnessing the power of the atom in a controlled way, as demonstrated at Chicago in 1942 and subsequently for military research, and applying the steady heat yield to generate electricity. This naturally gave rise to concerns about accidents and their possible effects. However, with nuclear power safety depends on much the same factors as in any comparable industry: intelligent planning, proper design with conservative margins and back-up systems, high-quality components and a well-developed safety culture in operations. A particular nuclear scenario was loss of cooling which resulted in melting of the nuclear reactor core, and this motivated studies on both the physical and chemical possibilities as well as the biological effects of any dispersed radioactivity. Those responsible for nuclear power technology in the West devoted extraordinary effort to ensuring that a meltdown of the reactor core would not take place, since it was assumed that a meltdown of the core would create a major public hazard, and if uncontained, a tragic accident with likely multiple fatalities. In avoiding such accidents the industry has been very successful. In over 14,500 cumulative reactor-years of commercial operation in 32 countries, there have been only three major accidents to nuclear power plants - Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima - the second being of little relevance to reactor design outside the old Soviet bloc. It was not until the late 1970s that detailed analyses and large-scale testing, followed by the 1979 meltdown of the Three Mile Island reactor, began to make clear that even the worst possible accident in a conventional western nuclear power plant or its fuel would not be likely to cause dramatic public harm. The industry still works hard to minimize the probability of a meltdown accident, but it is now clear that no-one need fear a potential public health catastrophe simply because a fuel meltdown happens. Fukushima has made that clear, with a triple meltdown causing no fatalities or serious radiation doses to anyone, while over two hundred people continued working on the site to mitigate the accident's effects. The decades-long test and analysis program showed that less radioactivity escapes from molten fuel than initially assumed, and that most of this radioactive material is not readily mobilized beyond the immediate internal structure. Thus, even if the containment structure that surrounds all modern nuclear plants were ruptured, as it has been with at least one of the Fukushima reactors, it is still very effective in preventing escape of most radioactivity. It is the laws of physics and the properties of materials that mitigate disaster, more than the required actions by safety equipment or personnel. In fact, licensing approval for new plants now requires that the effects of any core-melt accident must be confined to the plant itself, without the need to evacuate nearby residents. The three significant accidents in the 50-year history of civil nuclear power generation are: Three Mile Island (USA 1979) where the reactor was severely damaged but radiation was contained and there were no adverse health or environmental consequences Chernobyl (Ukraine 1986) where the destruction of the reactor by steam explosion and fire killed 31 people and had significant health and environmental consequences. The death toll has since increased to about 5 Fukushima (Japan 2011) where three old reactors (together with a fourth) were written off and the effects of loss of cooling due to a huge tsunami were inadequately contained. A table showing all reactor accidents, and a table listing some energy-related accidents with multiple fatalities are appended. These three significant accidents occurred during more than 14,000 reactor-years of civil operation. Of all the accidents and incidents, only the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents resulted in radiation doses to the public greater than those resulting from the exposure to natural sources. The Fukushima accident resulted in some radiation exposure of workers at the plant, but not such as to threaten their health, unlike Chernobyl. Other incidents (and one 'accident') have been completely confined to the plant. Apart from Chernobyl, no nuclear workers or members of the public have ever died as a result of exposure to radiation due to a commercial nuclear reactor incident. Most of the serious radiological injuries and deaths that occur each year (2-4 deaths and many more exposures above regulatory limits) are the result of large uncontrolled radiation sources, such as abandoned medical or industrial equipment.

"I think that we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest. In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof. This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis. In this sense, the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony. This is true in general, but it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished. It is a fortiori true of whatever is called ‘the West,’ of which the US has for about a century represented the vanguard. Lacking hegemony, the sheer drive for domination has to show its true face, its raw violence. The usual, traditional ideological justifications for dominance (such as bringing democracy and freedom here and there) have now become very weak because of the contempt that the dominant nations (the US and its most powerful allies) regularly show toward legality, morality, and humanity. Of course, the so-called rogue states, thriving on corruption, do not fare any better in this sense, but for them, when they act autonomously and against the dictates of ‘the West,’ the specter of punishment, in the form of retaliatory war or even indictment from the International Criminal Court, remains a clear limit, a possibility. Not so for the dominant nations: who will stop the United States from striking anywhere at will, or Israel from regularly massacring people in the Gaza Strip, or envious France from once again trying its luck in Africa? Yet, though still dominant, these nations are painfully aware of their structural, ontological and historical, weakness. All attempts at concealing that weakness (and the uncomfortable awareness of it) only heighten the brutality in the exertion of what remains of their dominance. Although they rely on a highly sophisticated military machine (the technology of drones is a clear instance of this) and on an equally sophisticated diplomacy, which has traditionally been and increasingly is an outpost for military operations and global policing (now excellently incarnated by Africom), they know that they have lost their hegemony.¶ ‘Domination without hegemony’ is a phrase that Giovanni Arrighi uses in his study of the long twentieth century and his lineages of the twenty-first century (1994/2010 and 2007). Originating with Ranajit Guha (1992), the phrase captures the singularity of the global crisis, the terminal stage of sovereignty, in Arrighi’s “historical investigation of the present and of the future” (1994/2010: 221). It acquires particular meaning in the light of Arrighi’s notion of the bifurcation of financial and military power. Without getting into the question, treated by Arrighi, of the rise of China and East Asia, what I want to note is that for Arrighi, early in the twenty-first century, and certainly with the ill-advised and catastrophic war against Iraq, “the US belle époque came to an end and US world hegemony entered what in all likelihood is its terminal crisis.” He continues:¶ Although the United States remains by far the world’s most powerful state, its relationship to the rest of the world is now best described as one of ‘domination without hegemony’ (1994/2010: 384). What can the US do next? Not much, short of brutal dominance. In the last few years, we have seen president Obama praising himself for the killing of Osama bin Laden. While that action was most likely unlawful, too (Noam Chomsky has often noted that bin Laden was a suspect, not someone charged with or found guilty of a crime), it is certain that you can kill all the bin Ladens of the world without gaining back a bit of hegemony. In fact, this killing, just like G. W. Bush’s war against Iraq, makes one think of a Mafia-style regolamento di conti more than any other thing. Barack Obama is less forthcoming about the killing of 16-year-old Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, whose fate many have correctly compared to that of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin (killed in Florida by a self-appointed security watchman), but it is precisely in cases like this one that the weakness at the heart of empire, the ill-concealed and uncontrolled fury for the loss of hegemony, becomes visible. The frenzy denies the possibility of power as care, which is what should replace hegemony, let alone domination. Nor am I sure I share Arrighi’s optimistic view about the possible rise of a new hegemonic center of power in East Asia and China: probably that would only be a shift in the axis of uncaring power, unable to affect, let alone exit, the paradigm of sovereignty and violence. What is needed is rather a radical alternative in which power as domination, with or without hegemony, is replaced by power as care – in other words, a poetic rather than military and financial shift.",summarize the following text: ,"we have now an understanding of what the situation is: The sovereign everywhere, be it the political or financial elite, fakes the legitimacy on which its power and authority supposedly rest In truth, they rest on violence and terror, or the threat thereof This is an obvious and essential aspect of the singularity of the present crisis the singularity of the crisis lies in the fact that the struggle for dominance is at one and the same time impaired and made more brutal by the lack of hegemony it is perhaps particularly true with respect to the greatest power on earth, the United States, whose hegemony has diminished or vanished.

"Third reason. In our techno-scientifico-militaro-diplomatic incompetence, we may consider ourselves, however, as competent as others to deal with a phenomenon whose essential feature is that of being fabulously textual, through and through. Nuclear weaponry depends, more than any weaponry in the past, it seems, upon structures of information and communication, structures of language, including non-vocalizable language, structures of codes and graphic decoding. But the phenomenon is fabulously textual also to the extent that, for the moment, a nuclear war has not taken place: one can only talk and write about it. You will say, perhaps: but it is not the first time; the other wars, too, so long as they hadn’t taken place, were only talked about and written about. And as to the fright of imaginary anticipation, what might prove that a European in the period following the war of 1870 might not have been more terrified by the ""technological"" image of the bombings and exterminations of the Second World War (even supposing he had been able to form such an image) than we are by the image we can construct for ourselves of a nuclear war? The logic of this argument is not devoid of value, especially if one is thinking about a limited and ""clean"" nuclear war. But it loses its value in the face of the hypothesis of a total nuclear war, which, as a hypothesis, or, if you prefer, as a fantasy, or phantasm, conditions every discourse and all strategies. Unlike the other wars, which have all been preceded by wars of more or less the same type in human memory (and gunpowder did not mark a radical break in this respect), nuclear war has no precedent. It has never occurred, itself; it is a non-event. The explosion of American bombs in 1945 ended a ""classical,"" conventional war; it did not set off a nuclear war. The terrifying reality of the nuclear conflict can only be the signified referent, never the real referent (present or past) of a discourse or a text. At least today apparently. And that sets us to thinking about today, our day, the presence of this present in and through that fabulous textuality. Better than ever and more than ever. The growing multiplication of the discourse-indeed, of the literature- on this subject may constitute a process of fearful domestication, the anticipatory assimilation of that unanticipatable entirely-other. For the moment, today, one may say that a non-localizable nuclear war has not occurred; it has existence only through what is said of it, only where it is talked about. Some might call it a fable, then, a pure invention: in the sense in which it is said that a myth, an image, a fiction, a utopia, a rhetorical figure, a fantasy, a phantasm, are inventions. It may also be called a speculation, even a fabulous specularization. The breaking of the mirror would be, finally, through an act of language, the very occurrence of nuclear war. Who can swear that our unconscious is not expecting this? dreaming of it, desiring it? You will perhaps find it shocking to find the nuclear issue reduced to a fable. But then I haven’t said simply that. I have recalled that a nuclear war is for the time being a fable, that is, something one can only talk about. But who can fail to recognize the massive ""reality"" of nuclear weaponry and of the terrifying forces of destruction that are being stockpiled and capitalized everywhere, that are coming to constitute the very movement of capitalization. One has to distinguish between this ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fiction of war. But, and this would perhaps be the imperative of a nuclear criticism, one must also be careful to interpret critically this critical or diacritical distinction. For the ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fable of nuclear war are perhaps distinct, but they are not two separate things. It is the war (in other words the fable) that triggers this fabulous war effort, this senseless capitalization of sophisticated weaponry, this speed race in search of speed, this crazy precipitation which, through techno-science, through all the techno-scientific inventiveness that it motivates, structures not only the army, diplomacy, politics, but the whole of the human socius today, everything that is named by the old words culture, civilization, Bildung, schole, paideia.

"The good news is that even without a congressional action, and even given President Obama’s opposition to legalizing recreational or medical marijuana, the CSA provides a standing invitation for his Administration to work out contractual cooperation agreements with Colorado, Washington, and some or all of the sixteen other medical marijuana states and the District of Columbia. The CSA not only directs that the Attorney General “shall cooperate” with the state and local governments on drugs but also gives him broad discretion to do so, through means including legally binding contractual agreements.
This is a president who has taken bold unilateral action amid congressional paralysis on issues including immigration (ordering amnesty for a generation of Dream Act immigrants), gay marriage (an extraordinary refusal to defend in federal court the duly enacted Defense of Marriage Act), and military force abroad (bombing Libya without consulting Congress, using drones to kill people in multiple countries, and much more). Doing with marijuana what the congressionally adopted CSA tells the Attorney General he should do (cooperate with the states) should not require much boldness.
Indeed, with this option sitting in plain view, it would be intolerable for the Obama Administration to put officials in eighteen states and D.C. to the choice of either ignoring the will of their own voters or gambling on limited enforcement of a federal marijuana law that is widely seen as outmoded. The Obama Administration should instead work with Colorado and Washington (and later with other medical marijuana states) to implement their partial legalization initiatives in ways that serve both federal and state interests in protecting the public health and safety.
Written contractual agreements should, suggests Tamar Todd of the Drug Policy Alliance, provide for Colorado and Washington to tightly control and regulate licensing, production and distribution within their borders and do everything feasible to prevent diversion to other states; for federal resources to focus primarily on preventing such diversion; and for federal and state law enforcement agencies to cooperate in targeting those who grow and distribute marijuana without state licenses. This would be more consonant with the CSA’s intent to control trafficking, abuse, and diversion than for federal and state governments to be at cross-purposes.
Federal-state agreements should also include clear, unambiguous commitments by the Attorney General to exercise his prosecutorial discretion to ensure that his Justice Department subordinates take no enforcement action against any state-licensed marijuana supplier unless the Attorney General (or a high-level designee) personally finds, in writing, that the supplier has violated state as well as federal law and that state and local authorities are unable or unwilling to correct the problem. Any such agreement could be voidable at the¶ option of the Attorney General if he believes that the state has failed to carry out responsibly its commitment to regulate.
This is not to suggest that such a contractual agreement could provide a state-licensed marijuana supplier with a legal defense recognized by the courts in the event of a federal prosecution or other enforcement action that violates the agreement. But the formality and specificity of a contractual agreement would provide a strong political deterrent to such an unwarranted enforcement action. It would also protect federal interests far more effectively than would a federal effort to abort states’ experiments_old with partial legalization.
The commitments that states would make in negotiating contractual agreements, and the subsequent federal scrutiny of their compliance, would help keep states honest, giving them a powerful incentive to take seriously their obligations to control marijuana distribution and accommodate federal priorities—as, for example, California has not done with medical marijuana. By the same token, the process of sitting down with the states and drawing up agreements would force the federal government to get its act together, by setting enforcement priorities and then applying them consistently—again, in marked contrast to the chaos and uncertainty that have so far marked the federal government’s approach to medical marijuana.
The moral is that we will need enlightened, determined leadership on both the federal and state level for the partial legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington to avoid the federal-state conflicts and confusion that have so far been emblematic of the Obama-Holder medical marijuana regime. Fortunately, the leaders of Colorado and Washington State appear so far to be doing a better job of setting clear rules and protecting federal interests than have the states whose medical marijuana regimes have been on the receiving end of most federal crackdowns.

"The good news is that even without a congressional action, and even given President Obama’s opposition to legalizing recreational or medical marijuana, the CSA provides a standing invitation for his Administration to work out contractual cooperation agreements with Colorado, Washington, and some or all of the sixteen other medical marijuana states and the District of Columbia. The CSA not only directs that the Attorney General “shall cooperate” with the state and local governments on drugs but also gives him broad discretion to do so, through means including legally binding contractual agreements.
This is a president who has taken bold unilateral action amid congressional paralysis on issues including immigration (ordering amnesty for a generation of Dream Act immigrants), gay marriage (an extraordinary refusal to defend in federal court the duly enacted Defense of Marriage Act), and military force abroad (bombing Libya without consulting Congress, using drones to kill people in multiple countries, and much more). Doing with marijuana what the congressionally adopted CSA tells the Attorney General he should do (cooperate with the states) should not require much boldness.
Indeed, with this option sitting in plain view, it would be intolerable for the Obama Administration to put officials in eighteen states and D.C. to the choice of either ignoring the will of their own voters or gambling on limited enforcement of a federal marijuana law that is widely seen as outmoded. The Obama Administration should instead work with Colorado and Washington (and later with other medical marijuana states) to implement their partial legalization initiatives in ways that serve both federal and state interests in protecting the public health and safety.
Written contractual agreements should, suggests Tamar Todd of the Drug Policy Alliance, provide for Colorado and Washington to tightly control and regulate licensing, production and distribution within their borders and do everything feasible to prevent diversion to other states; for federal resources to focus primarily on preventing such diversion; and for federal and state law enforcement agencies to cooperate in targeting those who grow and distribute marijuana without state licenses. This would be more consonant with the CSA’s intent to control trafficking, abuse, and diversion than for federal and state governments to be at cross-purposes.
Federal-state agreements should also include clear, unambiguous commitments by the Attorney General to exercise his prosecutorial discretion to ensure that his Justice Department subordinates take no enforcement action against any state-licensed marijuana supplier unless the Attorney General (or a high-level designee) personally finds, in writing, that the supplier has violated state as well as federal law and that state and local authorities are unable or unwilling to correct the problem. Any such agreement could be voidable at the¶ option of the Attorney General if he believes that the state has failed to carry out responsibly its commitment to regulate.
This is not to suggest that such a contractual agreement could provide a state-licensed marijuana supplier with a legal defense recognized by the courts in the event of a federal prosecution or other enforcement action that violates the agreement. But the formality and specificity of a contractual agreement would provide a strong political deterrent to such an unwarranted enforcement action. It would also protect federal interests far more effectively than would a federal effort to abort states’ experiments_old with partial legalization.
The commitments that states would make in negotiating contractual agreements, and the subsequent federal scrutiny of their compliance, would help keep states honest, giving them a powerful incentive to take seriously their obligations to control marijuana distribution and accommodate federal priorities—as, for example, California has not done with medical marijuana. By the same token, the process of sitting down with the states and drawing up agreements would force the federal government to get its act together, by setting enforcement priorities and then applying them consistently—again, in marked contrast to the chaos and uncertainty that have so far marked the federal government’s approach to medical marijuana.
The moral is that we will need enlightened, determined leadership on both the federal and state level for the partial legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington to avoid the federal-state conflicts and confusion that have so far been emblematic of the Obama-Holder medical marijuana regime. Fortunately, the leaders of Colorado and Washington State appear so far to be doing a better job of setting clear rules and protecting federal interests than have the states whose medical marijuana regimes have been on the receiving end of most federal crackdowns.

"What Is A Commodity Clearinghouse?
For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse. The tuna auctions in Tokyo and the tulip auctions in Holland still exist in their purest form. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, not surprisingly, evolved to become much more… but have the very same roots.
What does this have to do with our upcoming cannabis industry? Just about everything, if you are one that believes learning from past is more productive than reinventing the wheel.
As the potential centerpiece of Washington’s Marijuana Industry, an exchange solves many of the problems rule makers face in order to establish this new industry in a way that meets the expectations of voters, without handing the keys to the kingdom over to just a few big players.
Benefits of An Exchange Process For Cannabis
First of all, an exchange acts as a gateway for product to enter the marketplace. A place where lab reports can be scrutinized to allow for “bad” product to be identified and destroyed, where tracking can begin, and where the industry as a whole can be studied and scrutinized.
It also allows for a specific moment in time when taxes are due at the first tier (between the Producer and Processor) making accurate, honest and transparent tax collection possible, even without bank access. Tax collection is key, and if these large (cash) transactions take place behind closed doors, there will be no way to judge compliance.
It takes an open and transparent transaction to achieve those ends, but even more important is the role an exchange can play in curbing the black market.
There are 4 factors that must be managed in order to compete, and win, against the black market. Those are: price, convenience, selection and access.
As essentially an auction house, the exchange allows for prices to simply be controlled by supply and demand. The bidders, professional buyers (licensed as processors or distributors), will be able to adjust their offers based on current wholesale prices while taking into account the taxes that will be applied down the line.
This will lower the cost for medical marijuana as well, since growers will no longer be able to dictate their own prices – which is still a current remnant of the black-market-only era of marijuana use.
Producers will quickly learn that, as a legal business, they will no longer get paid the premium for risk that the illegal and gray-area operations historically charge, and the profitability of a production facility will eventually resemble that of any other specialty farm. If they want to garner top dollar, they will need to produce top quality product and let the market forces of supply and demand take over.
An exchange also provides the greatest access to the “second tier” for producers of any size.
Providing producer licenses a to smaller scale producers eliminates the chance that those who strive to be above-board are not forced into the black market. This also allows for unemployed, underemployed, and retired Washingtonians to make a go at earning some extra income, since compliance (taxes, tracking and lab reports) and sales and marketing (the ability to sell and compete based on quality and availability, as opposed to relationships or advertising) would be pre-built into the system.
Finally, convenience and selection to the end-user is achievable via a vibrant retail sector, supplied by processors and distributors who each have equal access to the entire range of product available statewide. This eliminates the potential problem of tier one and tier two licensees directing the best product to only a few preferred retail outlets, thereby hampering the required convenience and selection necessary to successfully diminish the viability of the black market.More Flexibility For a New Enterprise
Even with the ability to mitigate the black market, monitor and enforce compliance, and provide a transparent method of accurate tax collection, perhaps the greatest benefit of the exchange system is its ability to roll with the unexpected bumps and obstacles that accompany all new endeavors.
For example, an exchange provides a market for all grades and forms of marijuana to be sold, from top-quality flowers and leaf clippings, to stalks sold for hemp fiber. As these individual markets mature, each will eventually require their own standards and rules… and the exchange is where it all gets worked out –faster and with better results than is possible via further legislation.
Lastly, an exchange that focuses on quality and transparency would be destined to gain worldwide notoriety. Not only becoming a tourist attraction where spectators from around the globe will be drawn to watch such unique commerce take place, but it will also position Washington as the center of the legal cannabis industry, even as other states and countries start to allow for recreational use. Just like the tuna in Tokyo and tulips in Holland.",summarize the following text: ,"For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange evolved to become much more but have the very same roots

"No justice is exercised, no justice is rendered, no justice becomes effective nor does it determine itself in the form of law, without a decision that cuts and divides [une decision qui tranche]. This decision of justice does not simply consist in its final form-for example, a penal sanction, equitable or not, in the order of proportional or distributive justice. It begins, it ought to begin, by right [en droit] or in principle, in the initiative that amounts to learning, reading, understanding, interpreting the rule, and even calculating. For if calculation is calculation, the decision to calculate is not of the order of the calculable, and it must not be so [et ne doit pas I’ etre J. One often associates the theme of undecidability with deconstruction. Yet, the undecidable is not merely the oscillation between two significations or two contradictory and very determinate rules, each equally imperative (for example, respect for equity and universal right, but also for the always heterogeneous and unique singu­ lanty of the unsubsumable example). The undecidable is not merely the oscillation or the tension between two decisions. Undecidable-this is the experience of that which, though foreign and heterogeneous to the order of the calculable and the rule, must [ doit ] nonetheless-it is of duty [devoir] that one must speak-deliver itself over to the impossible decision while taking account of law and rules. A decision that would not go through the test and ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision; it would only be the programmable application or the continuous unfold­ ing of a calculable process. It might perhaps be legal; it would not be just. But in the moment of suspense of the undecidable, it is not just either, for only a decision is just. In order to maintain the proposition ""only a decision is just:’ one need not refer decision to the structure of a subject or to the propositional form of a Judgment. In a way, and at the risk of shocking, one could even say that a subject can never decide anything [ un sujet ne peut jamais rien decider l: a subject is even that to which a deci­ sion cannot come or happen [arriver] otherwise than as a marginal accident that does not affect the essential identity and the substantial presence-to-self that make a subject what it is-if the choice of the word subject is not arbitrary, at least, and if one trusts in what is in fact always required, in our culture, of a subject. Once the test and ordeal of the undecidable has passed (if that is possible, but this possibility is not pure, it is never like an other possibility: the memory of the undecidability must keep a living trace that forever marks a decision as such), the decision has again followed a rule, a given, invented or reinvented, and reaffirmed rule: it is no longer presently just, fully just. At no moment, it seems, can a decision be said to be presently and fully just: either it has not yet been made according to a rule and nothing allows one to call it just, or it has already followed a rule­ whether given, received, confirmed, preserved or reinvented-which, in its turn, nothing guarantees absolutely; and, moreover, if it were guaranteed, the decision would have turn back into calculation and one could not call it just. That is why the test and ordeal of the undecidable, of which I have just said it must be gone through by any decision worthy of this name, is never past or passed [paseee ou depassee], it is not a surmounted or sublated [ releve] (aufgehoben) moment in the decision. The undecidable remains caught, lodged, as a ghost at least, but an essen­ tial ghost, in every decision, in every event of decision. Its ghostliness [sa fan­ tomaticitel deconstructs from within all assurance of presence, all certainty or all alleged criteriology assuring us of the justice of a decision, in truth of the very event of a decision. Who will ever be able to assure and ensure that a decision as such has taken place, that it has not, through such and such a detour, followed a cause, a cal­ culation, a rule, without even that imperceptible suspense and suspension [suspens] that freely decides to apply-or not-a rule. A subjectal axiomatic of responsibility, of conscience, of intentionality, of prop­ erty and propriety, governs today’s dominant juridical discourse; it also governs the category of decision right down to its appeals to medical expertise. Yet this axiomatic is fragile and theoretically crude, something I need not emphasize here. The effects of these limitations affect more than all decisionism (naIve or sophIsti­ cated); they are concrete and massive enough to dispense here with examples. The obscure dogmatism that marks the discourses on the responsibility of an accused [prevenu], his mental state, the passionate character, premeditated or not, of a crime, the incredible depositions of witnesses and ""experts"" on this subject, would suffice to testify, in truth to prove, that no critical or criteriological rigor, no knowl­ edge, are accessible on this subject.",summarize the following text: ,"no justice becomes effective nor does it determine itself in the form of law, without a decision that cuts and divides This decision of justice does not simply consist in its final form It begins in the initiative that amounts to learning, reading, understanding, interpreting the rule, and even calculating One often associates the theme of undecidability with deconstruction.

"Third, it is difficult to understand why mere compensation destroys acts of generosity or blots out the ability of persons to give of themselves for the good. Fire fi ghters, police, and other rescue workers are deemed heroic for giving of themselves for the good and are yet paid for their labor and risk taking.

Requiring strict adherence to an ethic of generosity would rule out many donations. Most living organ donations are to family members or close friends, for example. Such donations might be motivated by love or beneficence or, perhaps, by family loyalty, gratitude, guilt, or avoidance of the shame of failing to donate. For these donors, their willingness to donate stems from their relationship with the particular patient and may not be fully altruistically motivated, much less embedded within an ethic of generosity.

Peter HUDSON, Political Studies Department, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, 13 [“The state and the colonial unconscious,” Social Dynamics, 2013, Vol. 39, No. 2, p. 263-277] bales
Thus the self-same/other distinction is necessary for the possibility of identity itself. There always has to exist an outside, which is also inside, to the extent it is designated as the impossibility from which the possibility of the existence of the subject derives its rule (Badiou 2009, 220). But although the excluded place which isn't excluded insofar as it is necessary for the very possibility of inclusion and identity may be universal (may be considered ""ontological""), its content (what fills it) - as well as the mode of this filling and its reproduction - are contingent, In other words, the meaning of the signifier of exclusion is not determined once and for all: the place of the place of exclusion, of death is itself over-determined, i.e. the very framework for deciding the other and the same, exclusion and inclusion, is nowhere engraved in ontological stone but is political and never terminally settled. Put differ- ently, the ""curvature of intersubjective space"" (Critchley 2007, 61) and thus, the specific modes of the ""othering"" of ""otherness"" are nowhere decided in advance (as a certain ontological fatalism might have it) (see Wilderson 2008). The social does not have to be divided into white and black, and the meaning of these signifiers is never necessary - because they are signifiers.
To be sure, colonialism institutes an ontological division, in that whites exist in a way barred to blacks - who are not. But this ontological relation is really on the side of the ontic - that is, of all contingently constructed identities, rather than the ontology of the social which refers to the ultimate unfixity, the indeterminacy or lack of the social. In this sense, then, the white man doesn't exist, the black man doesn't exist (Fanon 1968, 165); and neither does the colonial symbolic itself, including its most intimate structuring relations - division is constitutive of the social, not the colonial division.
""Whiteness"" may well be very deeply sediment in modernity itself, but respect for the ""ontological difference"" (see Heidegger 1962, 26; Watts 2011, 279) shows up its ontological status as ontic. It may be so deeply sedimented that it becomes difficult even to identify the very possibility of the separation of whiteness from the very possibility of order, but from this it does not follow that the ""void"" of ""black being"" functions as the ultimate substance, the transcendental signified on which all possible forms of sociality are said to rest. What gets lost here, then, is the specific- ity of colonialism, of its constitutive axis, its ""ontological"" differential.
A crucial feature of the colonial symbolic is that the real is not screened off by the imaginary in the way it is under capitalism. At the place of the colonised, the symbolic and the imaginary give way because non-identity (the real of the social) is immediately inscribed in the ""lived experience"" (vêcu) of the colonised subject. The colonised is ""traversing the fantasy"" (Zizek 2006a, 40-60) all the time; the void of the verb ""to be"" is the very content of his interpellation. The colonised is, in other words, the subject of anxiety for whom the symbolic and the imaginary never work, who is left stranded by his very interpellation.4 ""Fixed"" into ""non-fixity,"" he is eternally suspended between ""element"" and ""moment""5 - he is where the colonial symbolic falters in the production of meaning and is thus the point of entry of the real into the texture itself of colonialism.
Be this as it may, whiteness and blackness are (sustained by) determinate and contingent practices of signification; the ""structuring relation"" of colonialism thus itself comprises a knot of significations which, no matter how tight, can always be undone. Anti-colonial - i.e., anti-""white"" - modes of struggle are not (just) ""psychic”6 but involve the ""reactivation"" (or ""de-sedimentation"")7 of colonial objectivity itself. No matter how sedimented (or global), colonial objectivity is not ontologically immune to antagonism. Differentiality, as Zizek insists (see Zizek 2012, chapter 11, 771 n48), immanently entails antagonism in that differentiality both makes possible the existence of any identity whatsoever and at the same time - because it is the presence of one object in another - undermines any identity ever being (fully) itself. Each element in a differential relation is the condition of possibility and the condition of impossibility of each other. It is this dimension of antagonism that the Master Signifier covers over transforming its outside (Other) into an element of itself, reducing it to a condition of its possibility.8",summarize the following text: ,"although the excluded place which isn't excluded insofar as it is necessary for the very possibility of inclusion and identity may be universal (may be considered ""ontological""), its content (what fills it) - as well as the mode of this filling and its reproduction - are contingent the meaning of the signifier of exclusion is not determined once and for all the very framework for deciding the other is nowhere engraved in ontological stone but is political and never terminally settled the ""curvature of intersubjective space"" and thus, the specific modes of the ""othering"" of ""otherness"" are nowhere decided in advance (as a certain ontological fatalism might have it) (see Wilderson The social does not have to be divided into white and black, and the meaning of these signifiers is never necessary - because they are signifiers

"The good news is that even without a congressional action, and even given President Obama’s opposition to legalizing recreational or medical marijuana, the CSA provides a standing invitation for his Administration to work out contractual cooperation agreements with Colorado, Washington, and some or all of the sixteen other medical marijuana states and the District of Columbia. The CSA not only directs that the Attorney General “shall cooperate” with the state and local governments on drugs but also gives him broad discretion to do so, through means including legally binding contractual agreements.
This is a president who has taken bold unilateral action amid congressional paralysis on issues including immigration (ordering amnesty for a generation of Dream Act immigrants), gay marriage (an extraordinary refusal to defend in federal court the duly enacted Defense of Marriage Act), and military force abroad (bombing Libya without consulting Congress, using drones to kill people in multiple countries, and much more). Doing with marijuana what the congressionally adopted CSA tells the Attorney General he should do (cooperate with the states) should not require much boldness.
Indeed, with this option sitting in plain view, it would be intolerable for the Obama Administration to put officials in eighteen states and D.C. to the choice of either ignoring the will of their own voters or gambling on limited enforcement of a federal marijuana law that is widely seen as outmoded. The Obama Administration should instead work with Colorado and Washington (and later with other medical marijuana states) to implement their partial legalization initiatives in ways that serve both federal and state interests in protecting the public health and safety.
Written contractual agreements should, suggests Tamar Todd of the Drug Policy Alliance, provide for Colorado and Washington to tightly control and regulate licensing, production and distribution within their borders and do everything feasible to prevent diversion to other states; for federal resources to focus primarily on preventing such diversion; and for federal and state law enforcement agencies to cooperate in targeting those who grow and distribute marijuana without state licenses. This would be more consonant with the CSA’s intent to control trafficking, abuse, and diversion than for federal and state governments to be at cross-purposes.
Federal-state agreements should also include clear, unambiguous commitments by the Attorney General to exercise his prosecutorial discretion to ensure that his Justice Department subordinates take no enforcement action against any state-licensed marijuana supplier unless the Attorney General (or a high-level designee) personally finds, in writing, that the supplier has violated state as well as federal law and that state and local authorities are unable or unwilling to correct the problem. Any such agreement could be voidable at the¶ option of the Attorney General if he believes that the state has failed to carry out responsibly its commitment to regulate.
This is not to suggest that such a contractual agreement could provide a state-licensed marijuana supplier with a legal defense recognized by the courts in the event of a federal prosecution or other enforcement action that violates the agreement. But the formality and specificity of a contractual agreement would provide a strong political deterrent to such an unwarranted enforcement action. It would also protect federal interests far more effectively than would a federal effort to abort states’ experiments_old with partial legalization.
The commitments that states would make in negotiating contractual agreements, and the subsequent federal scrutiny of their compliance, would help keep states honest, giving them a powerful incentive to take seriously their obligations to control marijuana distribution and accommodate federal priorities—as, for example, California has not done with medical marijuana. By the same token, the process of sitting down with the states and drawing up agreements would force the federal government to get its act together, by setting enforcement priorities and then applying them consistently—again, in marked contrast to the chaos and uncertainty that have so far marked the federal government’s approach to medical marijuana.
The moral is that we will need enlightened, determined leadership on both the federal and state level for the partial legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado and Washington to avoid the federal-state conflicts and confusion that have so far been emblematic of the Obama-Holder medical marijuana regime. Fortunately, the leaders of Colorado and Washington State appear so far to be doing a better job of setting clear rules and protecting federal interests than have the states whose medical marijuana regimes have been on the receiving end of most federal crackdowns.

"Third reason. In our techno-scientifico-militaro-diplomatic incompetence, we may consider ourselves, however, as competent as others to deal with a phenomenon whose essential feature is that of being fabulously textual, through and through. Nuclear weaponry depends, more than any weaponry in the past, it seems, upon structures of information and communication, structures of language, including non-vocalizable language, structures of codes and graphic decoding. But the phenomenon is fabulously textual also to the extent that, for the moment, a nuclear war has not taken place: one can only talk and write about it. You will say, perhaps: but it is not the first time; the other wars, too, so long as they hadn’t taken place, were only talked about and written about. And as to the fright of imaginary anticipation, what might prove that a European in the period following the war of 1870 might not have been more terrified by the ""technological"" image of the bombings and exterminations of the Second World War (even supposing he had been able to form such an image) than we are by the image we can construct for ourselves of a nuclear war? The logic of this argument is not devoid of value, especially if one is thinking about a limited and ""clean"" nuclear war. But it loses its value in the face of the hypothesis of a total nuclear war, which, as a hypothesis, or, if you prefer, as a fantasy, or phantasm, conditions every discourse and all strategies. Unlike the other wars, which have all been preceded by wars of more or less the same type in human memory (and gunpowder did not mark a radical break in this respect), nuclear war has no precedent. It has never occurred, itself; it is a non-event. The explosion of American bombs in 1945 ended a ""classical,"" conventional war; it did not set off a nuclear war. The terrifying reality of the nuclear conflict can only be the signified referent, never the real referent (present or past) of a discourse or a text. At least today apparently. And that sets us to thinking about today, our day, the presence of this present in and through that fabulous textuality. Better than ever and more than ever. The growing multiplication of the discourse-indeed, of the literature- on this subject may constitute a process of fearful domestication, the anticipatory assimilation of that unanticipatable entirely-other. For the moment, today, one may say that a non-localizable nuclear war has not occurred; it has existence only through what is said of it, only where it is talked about. Some might call it a fable, then, a pure invention: in the sense in which it is said that a myth, an image, a fiction, a utopia, a rhetorical figure, a fantasy, a phantasm, are inventions. It may also be called a speculation, even a fabulous specularization. The breaking of the mirror would be, finally, through an act of language, the very occurrence of nuclear war. Who can swear that our unconscious is not expecting this? dreaming of it, desiring it? You will perhaps find it shocking to find the nuclear issue reduced to a fable. But then I haven’t said simply that. I have recalled that a nuclear war is for the time being a fable, that is, something one can only talk about. But who can fail to recognize the massive ""reality"" of nuclear weaponry and of the terrifying forces of destruction that are being stockpiled and capitalized everywhere, that are coming to constitute the very movement of capitalization. One has to distinguish between this ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fiction of war. But, and this would perhaps be the imperative of a nuclear criticism, one must also be careful to interpret critically this critical or diacritical distinction. For the ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fable of nuclear war are perhaps distinct, but they are not two separate things. It is the war (in other words the fable) that triggers this fabulous war effort, this senseless capitalization of sophisticated weaponry, this speed race in search of speed, this crazy precipitation which, through techno-science, through all the techno-scientific inventiveness that it motivates, structures not only the army, diplomacy, politics, but the whole of the human socius today, everything that is named by the old words culture, civilization, Bildung, schole, paideia. ""Reality,"" let’s say the encompassing institution of the nuclear age, is constructed by the fable, on the basis of an event that has never happened (except in fantasy, and that is not nothing at all),* an event of which one can only speak, an event whose advent remains an invention by men (in all the senses of the word ""invention"") or which, rather, remains to be invented. An invention because it depends upon new technical mechanisms, to be sure, but an invention also because it does not exist and especially because, at whatever point it should come into existence, it would be a grand premiere appearance",summarize the following text: ,"In our techno-scientifico-militaro-diplomatic incompetence, we may consider ourselves, as competent as others to deal with a phenomenon whose essential feature is that of being fabulously textual, through and through.

"Third, it is difficult to understand why mere compensation destroys acts of generosity or blots out the ability of persons to give of themselves for the good.

"No justice is exercised, no justice is rendered, no justice becomes effective nor does it determine itself in the form of law, without a decision that cuts and divides [une decision qui tranche]. This decision of justice does not simply consist in its final form-for example, a penal sanction, equitable or not, in the order of proportional or distributive justice. It begins, it ought to begin, by right [en droit] or in principle, in the initiative that amounts to learning, reading, understanding, interpreting the rule, and even calculating. For if calculation is calculation, the decision to calculate is not of the order of the calculable, and it must not be so [et ne doit pas I’ etre J. One often associates the theme of undecidability with deconstruction. Yet, the undecidable is not merely the oscillation between two significations or two contradictory and very determinate rules, each equally imperative (for example, respect for equity and universal right, but also for the always heterogeneous and unique singu­ lanty of the unsubsumable example). The undecidable is not merely the oscillation or the tension between two decisions. Undecidable-this is the experience of that which, though foreign and heterogeneous to the order of the calculable and the rule, must [ doit ] nonetheless-it is of duty [devoir] that one must speak-deliver itself over to the impossible decision while taking account of law and rules. A decision that would not go through the test and ordeal of the undecidable would not be a free decision; it would only be the programmable application or the continuous unfold­ ing of a calculable process. It might perhaps be legal; it would not be just. But in the moment of suspense of the undecidable, it is not just either, for only a decision is just. In order to maintain the proposition ""only a decision is just:’ one need not refer decision to the structure of a subject or to the propositional form of a Judgment. In a way, and at the risk of shocking, one could even say that a subject can never decide anything [ un sujet ne peut jamais rien decider l: a subject is even that to which a deci­ sion cannot come or happen [arriver] otherwise than as a marginal accident that does not affect the essential identity and the substantial presence-to-self that make a subject what it is-if the choice of the word subject is not arbitrary, at least, and if one trusts in what is in fact always required, in our culture, of a subject. Once the test and ordeal of the undecidable has passed (if that is possible, but this possibility is not pure, it is never like an other possibility: the memory of the undecidability must keep a living trace that forever marks a decision as such), the decision has again followed a rule, a given, invented or reinvented, and reaffirmed rule: it is no longer presently just, fully just. At no moment, it seems, can a decision be said to be presently and fully just: either it has not yet been made according to a rule and nothing allows one to call it just, or it has already followed a rule­ whether given, received, confirmed, preserved or reinvented-which, in its turn, nothing guarantees absolutely; and, moreover, if it were guaranteed, the decision would have turn back into calculation and one could not call it just. That is why the test and ordeal of the undecidable, of which I have just said it must be gone through by any decision worthy of this name, is never past or passed [paseee ou depassee], it is not a surmounted or sublated [ releve] (aufgehoben) moment in the decision. The undecidable remains caught, lodged, as a ghost at least, but an essen­ tial ghost, in every decision, in every event of decision. Its ghostliness [sa fan­ tomaticitel deconstructs from within all assurance of presence, all certainty or all alleged criteriology assuring us of the justice of a decision, in truth of the very event of a decision. Who will ever be able to assure and ensure that a decision as such has taken place, that it has not, through such and such a detour, followed a cause, a cal­ culation, a rule, without even that imperceptible suspense and suspension [suspens] that freely decides to apply-or not-a rule. A subjectal axiomatic of responsibility, of conscience, of intentionality, of prop­ erty and propriety, governs today’s dominant juridical discourse; it also governs the category of decision right down to its appeals to medical expertise. Yet this axiomatic is fragile and theoretically crude, something I need not emphasize here. The effects of these limitations affect more than all decisionism (naIve or sophIsti­ cated); they are concrete and massive enough to dispense here with examples. The obscure dogmatism that marks the discourses on the responsibility of an accused [prevenu], his mental state, the passionate character, premeditated or not, of a crime, the incredible depositions of witnesses and ""experts"" on this subject, would suffice to testify, in truth to prove, that no critical or criteriological rigor, no knowl­ edge, are accessible on this subject.",summarize the following text: ,"no justice becomes effective nor does it determine itself in the form of law, without a decision that cuts and divides This decision of justice does not simply consist in its final form It begins in the initiative that amounts to learning, reading, understanding, interpreting the rule, and even calculating One often associates the theme of undecidability with deconstruction. Yet, the undecidable is not merely the oscillation between two contradictory and very determinate rules Undecidable-this is the experience of that which, though foreign and heterogeneous to the order of the calculable and the rule, must nonetheless-it is of duty that one must speak-deliver itself over to the impossible decision while taking account of law and rules. in the moment of suspense of the undecidable, it is not just either, for only a decision is just. At no moment, it seems, can a decision be said to be presently and fully just: either it has not yet been made according to a rule and nothing allows one to call it just, or it has already followed a rule­ whether given, received, confirmed, preserved or reinvented-which, in its turn, nothing guarantees absolutely; and, moreover, if it were guaranteed, the decision would have turn back into calculation and one could not call it just.

"Third reason. In our techno-scientifico-militaro-diplomatic incompetence, we may consider ourselves, however, as competent as others to deal with a phenomenon whose essential feature is that of being fabulously textual, through and through. Nuclear weaponry depends, more than any weaponry in the past, it seems, upon structures of information and communication, structures of language, including non-vocalizable language, structures of codes and graphic decoding. But the phenomenon is fabulously textual also to the extent that, for the moment, a nuclear war has not taken place: one can only talk and write about it. You will say, perhaps: but it is not the first time; the other wars, too, so long as they hadn’t taken place, were only talked about and written about. And as to the fright of imaginary anticipation, what might prove that a European in the period following the war of 1870 might not have been more terrified by the ""technological"" image of the bombings and exterminations of the Second World War (even supposing he had been able to form such an image) than we are by the image we can construct for ourselves of a nuclear war? The logic of this argument is not devoid of value, especially if one is thinking about a limited and ""clean"" nuclear war. But it loses its value in the face of the hypothesis of a total nuclear war, which, as a hypothesis, or, if you prefer, as a fantasy, or phantasm, conditions every discourse and all strategies. Unlike the other wars, which have all been preceded by wars of more or less the same type in human memory (and gunpowder did not mark a radical break in this respect), nuclear war has no precedent. It has never occurred, itself; it is a non-event. The explosion of American bombs in 1945 ended a ""classical,"" conventional war; it did not set off a nuclear war. The terrifying reality of the nuclear conflict can only be the signified referent, never the real referent (present or past) of a discourse or a text. At least today apparently. And that sets us to thinking about today, our day, the presence of this present in and through that fabulous textuality. Better than ever and more than ever. The growing multiplication of the discourse-indeed, of the literature- on this subject may constitute a process of fearful domestication, the anticipatory assimilation of that unanticipatable entirely-other. For the moment, today, one may say that a non-localizable nuclear war has not occurred; it has existence only through what is said of it, only where it is talked about. Some might call it a fable, then, a pure invention: in the sense in which it is said that a myth, an image, a fiction, a utopia, a rhetorical figure, a fantasy, a phantasm, are inventions. It may also be called a speculation, even a fabulous specularization. The breaking of the mirror would be, finally, through an act of language, the very occurrence of nuclear war. Who can swear that our unconscious is not expecting this? dreaming of it, desiring it? You will perhaps find it shocking to find the nuclear issue reduced to a fable. But then I haven’t said simply that. I have recalled that a nuclear war is for the time being a fable, that is, something one can only talk about. But who can fail to recognize the massive ""reality"" of nuclear weaponry and of the terrifying forces of destruction that are being stockpiled and capitalized everywhere, that are coming to constitute the very movement of capitalization. One has to distinguish between this ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fiction of war. But, and this would perhaps be the imperative of a nuclear criticism, one must also be careful to interpret critically this critical or diacritical distinction. For the ""reality"" of the nuclear age and the fable of nuclear war are perhaps distinct, but they are not two separate things. It is the war (in other words the fable) that triggers this fabulous war effort, this senseless capitalization of sophisticated weaponry, this speed race in search of speed, this crazy precipitation which, through techno-science, through all the techno-scientific inventiveness that it motivates, structures not only the army, diplomacy, politics, but the whole of the human socius today, everything that is named by the old words culture, civilization, Bildung, schole, paideia. ""Reality,"" let’s say the encompassing institution of the nuclear age, is constructed by the fable, on the basis of an event that has never happened (except in fantasy, and that is not nothing at all),* an event of which one can only speak, an event whose advent remains an invention by men (in all the senses of the word ""invention"") or which, rather, remains to be invented. An invention because it depends upon new technical mechanisms, to be sure, but an invention also because it does not exist and especially because, at whatever point it should come into existence, it would be a grand premiere appearance.",summarize the following text: ,"In our techno-scientifico-militaro-diplomatic incompetence, we may consider ourselves, however, as competent as others to deal with a phenomenon whose essential feature is that of being fabulously textual, through and through.

"What Is A Commodity Clearinghouse?
For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse. The tuna auctions in Tokyo and the tulip auctions in Holland still exist in their purest form. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, not surprisingly, evolved to become much more… but have the very same roots.
What does this have to do with our upcoming cannabis industry? Just about everything, if you are one that believes learning from past is more productive than reinventing the wheel.
As the potential centerpiece of Washington’s Marijuana Industry, an exchange solves many of the problems rule makers face in order to establish this new industry in a way that meets the expectations of voters, without handing the keys to the kingdom over to just a few big players.
Benefits of An Exchange Process For Cannabis
First of all, an exchange acts as a gateway for product to enter the marketplace. A place where lab reports can be scrutinized to allow for “bad” product to be identified and destroyed, where tracking can begin, and where the industry as a whole can be studied and scrutinized.
It also allows for a specific moment in time when taxes are due at the first tier (between the Producer and Processor) making accurate, honest and transparent tax collection possible, even without bank access. Tax collection is key, and if these large (cash) transactions take place behind closed doors, there will be no way to judge compliance.
It takes an open and transparent transaction to achieve those ends, but even more important is the role an exchange can play in curbing the black market.
There are 4 factors that must be managed in order to compete, and win, against the black market. Those are: price, convenience, selection and access.
As essentially an auction house, the exchange allows for prices to simply be controlled by supply and demand. The bidders, professional buyers (licensed as processors or distributors), will be able to adjust their offers based on current wholesale prices while taking into account the taxes that will be applied down the line.
This will lower the cost for medical marijuana as well, since growers will no longer be able to dictate their own prices – which is still a current remnant of the black-market-only era of marijuana use.
Producers will quickly learn that, as a legal business, they will no longer get paid the premium for risk that the illegal and gray-area operations historically charge, and the profitability of a production facility will eventually resemble that of any other specialty farm. If they want to garner top dollar, they will need to produce top quality product and let the market forces of supply and demand take over.
An exchange also provides the greatest access to the “second tier” for producers of any size.
Providing producer licenses a to smaller scale producers eliminates the chance that those who strive to be above-board are not forced into the black market. This also allows for unemployed, underemployed, and retired Washingtonians to make a go at earning some extra income, since compliance (taxes, tracking and lab reports) and sales and marketing (the ability to sell and compete based on quality and availability, as opposed to relationships or advertising) would be pre-built into the system.
Finally, convenience and selection to the end-user is achievable via a vibrant retail sector, supplied by processors and distributors who each have equal access to the entire range of product available statewide. This eliminates the potential problem of tier one and tier two licensees directing the best product to only a few preferred retail outlets, thereby hampering the required convenience and selection necessary to successfully diminish the viability of the black market.More Flexibility For a New Enterprise
Even with the ability to mitigate the black market, monitor and enforce compliance, and provide a transparent method of accurate tax collection, perhaps the greatest benefit of the exchange system is its ability to roll with the unexpected bumps and obstacles that accompany all new endeavors.
For example, an exchange provides a market for all grades and forms of marijuana to be sold, from top-quality flowers and leaf clippings, to stalks sold for hemp fiber. As these individual markets mature, each will eventually require their own standards and rules… and the exchange is where it all gets worked out –faster and with better results than is possible via further legislation.
Lastly, an exchange that focuses on quality and transparency would be destined to gain worldwide notoriety. Not only becoming a tourist attraction where spectators from around the globe will be drawn to watch such unique commerce take place, but it will also position Washington as the center of the legal cannabis industry, even as other states and countries start to allow for recreational use.

"Potentially stronger criticisms of Giroux’s text lie precisely in his underlying hypothesis concerning the totalising power of neo-conservatism. Giroux shares with the members of the Frankfurt School, who he approvingly cites, a pessimistic and almost wholly determined account of future social developments, in which the prognosis for alternatives to dominant powers looks bleak. Giroux, like Adorno and Marcuse, fears that we are approaching a one-dimensional future composed of intellectually stunted individuals, who are manipulated by the cultural industries, endorse militarised social hierarchies and engage in relationships conceived of only in terms of market-values. This grim dystopia is subject to continual monitoring by an evermore technologically-equipped police and legitimised by an increasingly subservient, partisan and trivial media. However, whilst Giroux’s account of growing authoritarianism is convincingly expressed, it is potentially disempowering, as it would suggest little space for opposition. It is not simply wishful thinking to suggest that the existing power structures are neither as complete nor as impervious as Giroux’s account would suggest. Whilst the old media of radio, film and television are increasingly dominated by a few giant corporations (p.46), new technologies have opened access to dissident voices and created new forms of communication and organisation. Whilst the military are extending their reach into greater areas of social and political life, and intervening in greater force throughout the globe, resistance to military discipline is also arising, with fewer willing to join the army in both the US and UK.7 Bush’s long term military objectives look increasingly unfeasible as Peter Schoomaker, the former US Chief of Staff, told Congress on December 15, 2006 that even the existing deployment policy is looking increasingly ‘untenable’.8 The ‘overstretch’ of military resources is matched by an economy incapable of fulfilling its primary neo-conservative goals of low taxation, sound national finances and extensive military interventions. Whilst this is not to suggest that the US is on the point of financial implosion, the transition to a fully proto-fascist state is unlikely to be seamless or certain. Giroux’s preferred form of resistance is radical education. The photographs from Abu Ghraib were iconic not just in their encapsulation of proto-fascism, but in their public pedagogic role. Their prominence highlighted the many different sites of interpretation, as Giroux rightly stresses, there is no single way to interpret a photograph, however potent the depiction. The ability to interpret an image requires an ongoing process by a critical citizenry capable of identifying the methods by which a picture’s meanings are constructed (p. 135). Giroux’s critical pedagogy overtly borrows from Adorno’s essay ‘Education After Auschwitz’, and proposes “modes of education that produce critical, engaging and free minds” (p. 141). But herein lies one of the flaws with the text: Giroux never spells out what sorts of existing institutions and social practices are practical models of this critical pedagogy. Thus, he does not indicate what methods he finds appropriate in resisting the proto-fascist onslaught nor how merely interpreting images critically would fundamentally contest hierarchical power-relationships. Questions arise as to the adequacy of his response to the totalising threat he identifies in the main section of the book. Clearly existing academic institutions in the US are barely adequate given the campaigns against dissident academics led by David Horowitz (p.143). Giroux recounts in the final chapter, an interview conducted by Sina Rahmani, his own flight from the prestigious Penn State University to McMaster University in Canada because of managerial harassment following his public criticisms of Penn’s involvement in military research (p. 186). But whilst Giroux recognises that education is far wider than what takes place in institutions of learning there is no account of what practical forms these take. Nor does Giroux give an account of why a critical pedagogy would take priority over informed aesthetic or ethical practices. Such a concentration on education would appear to prioritise those who already have (by virtue of luck or social circumstance) an already existing expertise in critical thinking, risking an oppressive power-relationship in which the expert drills the student into rigorous assessment. This lapse into the role of the strident instructor demanding the correct form of radical response, occasionally appears in Giroux’s text: “within the boundaries of critical education, students have to learn the skills and knowledge to narrate their own stories [and] resist the fragmentation and seductions of market ideologies” (p. 155). Woe betide the student who prefers to narrate the story of the person sitting next to them, or fails to measure up to the ‘educators’ standard of critical evaluation.",summarize the following text: ,"criticisms of Giroux lie in his underlying hypothesis concerning the totalising power of neo-conservatism Giroux shares a pessimistic and wholly determined account of future social developments, in which alternatives to dominant powers looks bleak Giroux’s account of growing authoritarianism is potentially disempowering, as it would suggest little space for opposition existing power structures are neither as complete nor as impervious as Giroux’s account would suggest  technologies have opened access to dissident voices and created new forms of communication and organisation resistance to military discipline is also arising even the existing deployment policy is looking increasingly ‘untenable’ the transition to a fully proto-fascist state is unlikely to be seamless or certain.

"The Struggle for the Future II: A Plural World Deglobalization or the reempowerment of the local and national, however, can only succeed if it takes place within an alternative system of global economic governance. What are the contours of such a world economic order? The answer to this is contained in our critique of the Bretton Woods cum WTO system as a monolithic system of universal rules imposed by highly centralized institutions to further the interests of corporations-and, in particular, US corporations. To try to supplant this with another centralized global system of rules and institutions, though these may be premised on different principles, is likely to reproduce the same Jurassic trap that ensnared organizations as different as IBM, the IMF, and the Soviet state, and this is the inability to tolerate and profit from diversity. Today's need is not another centralized global institution but the deconcentration and decentralization of institutional power and the creation of a pluralistic system of institutions and organizations interacting with one another, guided by broad and flexible agreements and understandings. We are not talking about something completely new. For it was under such a more pluralistic system of global economic governance, where hegemonic power was still far from institutionalized in a set of all-encompassing and powerful multilateral organizations and institutions that a number of Latin American and Asian countries were able to achieve a modicum of industrial development in the period from 1950 to 1970. It was under such a pluralistic system, under a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) that was limited in its power, flexible, and more sympathetic to the special status of developing countries, that the East and Southeast Asian countries were able to become newly industrializing countries through activist state trade and industrial policies that departed significantly from the free-market biases enshrined in the WTO. Of course, economic relations among countries prior to the attempt to institutionalize one global free market system beginning in the early 1980's were not ideal, nor were the Third World economies that resulted ideal. But these conditions and structures underline the fact that the alternative to an economic Pax Romana built around the World Bank-IMF-WTO system is not a Hobbesian state of nature. The reality of international relations in a world marked by a multiplicity of international and regional institutions that check one another is a far cry from the propaganda image of a ""nasty"" and ""brutish"" world. Of course, the threat of unilateral action by the powerful is ever present in such a system, but it is one that even the most powerful hesitate to take for fear of its consequences on their legitimacy as well as the reaction it would provoke in the form of opposing coalitions. In other words, what developing countries and international civil society should aim at is not to reform the TNC-driven WTO and Bretton Woods institutions, but, through a combination of passive and active measures, to radically reduce their powers and to turn them into just another set of actors coexisting with and being checked by other international organizations, agreements, and regional groupings. These would include such diverse actors and institutions as UNCTAD, multilateral environmental agreements, the International Labor Organization, the European Union, new regional development banks, regional monetary mechanisms such as the ASEAN+3 Monetary Arrangement, and evolving trade blocs such as Mercosur in Latin America, SAARC in South Asia, SADCC in Southern Africa, and a revitalized ASEAN in Southeast Asia. More space, more flexibility, more compromise-these should be the goals of the Southern agenda and the civil society effort to build a new system of global economic governance. It is in such a more fluid, less structured, more pluralistic world, with multiple checks and balances, that the nations and communities of the South-and the North-will be able to carve out the space to develop based on their values, their rhythms, and the strategies of their choice. Let me quote John Gray one last time. ""It is legitimate and indeed imperative"", he says, ""that we seek a form of rootedness which is sheltered from overthrow by technologies and market processes which in achieving a global reach that is disembedded from any community or culture, cannot avoid desolating the earth's human settlements and its non-human environments"". The role of international arrangements in a world where toleration of diversity is a central principle of economic organization would be ""to express and protect local and national cultures by embodying and sheltering their distinctive practices"". (34) It is time to abort this arrogant globalist project of making the world a synthetic unity of individual atoms shorn of culture and community. It is time to herald, instead, an internationalism that is built on, tolerates, respects, and enhances the diversity of human communities and the diversity of life.",summarize the following text: ,"the reempowerment of the local and national, however, can only succeed if it takes place within an alternative system of global economic governance. What are the contours of such a world economic order? The answer to this is contained in our critique of the Bretton Woods cum WTO system Today's need is not another centralized global institution but the deconcentration and decentralization of institutional power and the creation of a pluralistic system of institutions and organizations interacting with one another We are not talking about something completely new. For it was under such a more pluralistic system of global economic governance, where hegemonic power was still far from institutionalized in a set of all-encompassing and powerful multilateral organizations and institutions that a number of Latin American and Asian countries were able to achieve a modicum of industrial development in the period from 1950 to 1970 the alternative to an economic Pax Romana built around the World Bank-IMF-WTO system is not a Hobbesian state of nature The reality of international relations in a world marked by a multiplicity of international and regional institutions that check one another is a far cry from the propaganda image of a ""nasty"" and ""brutish"" world the threat of unilateral action by the powerful is ever present in such a system, but it is one that even the most powerful hesitate to take for fear of its consequences on their legitimacy as well as the reaction it would provoke in the form of opposing coalitions It is time to herald, instead, an internationalism that is built on, tolerates, respects, and enhances the diversity of human communities and the diversity of life"
"What Is A Commodity Clearinghouse?
For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse. The tuna auctions in Tokyo and the tulip auctions in Holland still exist in their purest form. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, not surprisingly, evolved to become much more… but have the very same roots.
What does this have to do with our upcoming cannabis industry? Just about everything, if you are one that believes learning from past is more productive than reinventing the wheel.
As the potential centerpiece of Washington’s Marijuana Industry, an exchange solves many of the problems rule makers face in order to establish this new industry in a way that meets the expectations of voters, without handing the keys to the kingdom over to just a few big players.
Benefits of An Exchange Process For Cannabis
First of all, an exchange acts as a gateway for product to enter the marketplace. A place where lab reports can be scrutinized to allow for “bad” product to be identified and destroyed, where tracking can begin, and where the industry as a whole can be studied and scrutinized.
It also allows for a specific moment in time when taxes are due at the first tier (between the Producer and Processor) making accurate, honest and transparent tax collection possible, even without bank access. Tax collection is key, and if these large (cash) transactions take place behind closed doors, there will be no way to judge compliance.
It takes an open and transparent transaction to achieve those ends, but even more important is the role an exchange can play in curbing the black market.
There are 4 factors that must be managed in order to compete, and win, against the black market. Those are: price, convenience, selection and access.
As essentially an auction house, the exchange allows for prices to simply be controlled by supply and demand. The bidders, professional buyers (licensed as processors or distributors), will be able to adjust their offers based on current wholesale prices while taking into account the taxes that will be applied down the line.
This will lower the cost for medical marijuana as well, since growers will no longer be able to dictate their own prices – which is still a current remnant of the black-market-only era of marijuana use.
Producers will quickly learn that, as a legal business, they will no longer get paid the premium for risk that the illegal and gray-area operations historically charge, and the profitability of a production facility will eventually resemble that of any other specialty farm. If they want to garner top dollar, they will need to produce top quality product and let the market forces of supply and demand take over.
An exchange also provides the greatest access to the “second tier” for producers of any size.
Providing producer licenses a to smaller scale producers eliminates the chance that those who strive to be above-board are not forced into the black market. This also allows for unemployed, underemployed, and retired Washingtonians to make a go at earning some extra income, since compliance (taxes, tracking and lab reports) and sales and marketing (the ability to sell and compete based on quality and availability, as opposed to relationships or advertising) would be pre-built into the system.
Finally, convenience and selection to the end-user is achievable via a vibrant retail sector, supplied by processors and distributors who each have equal access to the entire range of product available statewide. This eliminates the potential problem of tier one and tier two licensees directing the best product to only a few preferred retail outlets, thereby hampering the required convenience and selection necessary to successfully diminish the viability of the black market.More Flexibility For a New Enterprise
Even with the ability to mitigate the black market, monitor and enforce compliance, and provide a transparent method of accurate tax collection, perhaps the greatest benefit of the exchange system is its ability to roll with the unexpected bumps and obstacles that accompany all new endeavors.
For example, an exchange provides a market for all grades and forms of marijuana to be sold, from top-quality flowers and leaf clippings, to stalks sold for hemp fiber. As these individual markets mature, each will eventually require their own standards and rules… and the exchange is where it all gets worked out –faster and with better results than is possible via further legislation.
Lastly, an exchange that focuses on quality and transparency would be destined to gain worldwide notoriety. Not only becoming a tourist attraction where spectators from around the globe will be drawn to watch such unique commerce take place, but it will also position Washington as the center of the legal cannabis industry, even as other states and countries start to allow for recreational use. Just like the tuna in Tokyo and tulips in Holland.",summarize the following text: ,"For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange evolved to become much more but have the very same roots

"Nate Silver doesn’t look very threatening.  With his spindly frame and eyeglasses, he looks more like the prototypical 98 pound weakling than an emergent media juggernaut, but he’s got a lot of people running scared nonetheless.
Whereas other pundits earn their living through a special blend of insights and access to inside sources, Silver has neither.  In fact, he bases his analysis on data that, in most cases, everyone else has yet he’s somehow able to prove experts wrong.
And that’s exactly what makes Silver so scary, not for what he does, but what he represents—the primacy of data and analysis over personal experience.  If Silver, a relative neophyte with no real experience on the political beat or in the halls of power can outperform respected pundits, then what does that say about the rest of us?
The Invasion Of The Quants
While many in the news world see Silver and his fellow data journalists as newfangled interlopers, the truth is that politics is only the most recent area where data has upended the existing order.
In his book The Quants, Scott Patterson chronicles how, starting in the early 1970’s, traders armed with computers and algorithms began dominating those who went on instinct.  Today, trading programs operate with limited day-to-day intervention and execute trades in microseconds, much faster than any human could hope to keep up with.
Since then, data analysis has bested experts in a number of fields.  In Super Crunchers, Ian Ayers explains how Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist, outperformed the most influential critics with his wine equation and Sabremetrics redefined how professional baseball managers evaluated talent.
Today, data has become a big business.  The Google Flu Trends service monitors outbreaks of influenza and algorithms that evaluate creative work are being deployed in the music and film industries.  It was only a matter of time before someone like Nate Silver came along.
How Experts Fail
Most people are paid for their work, but experts are paid for their insights.  They succeed by boldly asserting claims that no one else has thought of.  With superior experience, access and intelligence, experts purport to look beyond the surface, to that which is not immediately apparent to those of us with less penetrating minds.
Unfortunately, this often leads to what Daniel Kahneman calls “substituting one question for another.”  Rather than merely looking at what the facts tell them, experts often listen to their inner voice and then go find the data needed to support their argument.  Here’s longtime pundit Peggy Noonan writing just a day before the 2012 election.
Romney’s crowds are building—28,000 in Morrisville, Pa., last night; 30,000 in West Chester, Ohio, Friday.  It isn’t only a triumph of advance planning: People came, they got through security and waited for hours in the cold. His rallies look like rallies now…
…All the vibrations are right… Something is roaring back…
Is it possible this whole thing is playing out before our eyes and we’re not really noticing because we’re too busy looking at data on paper instead of what’s in front of us? Maybe that’s the real distortion of the polls this year: They left us discounting the world around us.
And there is Obama, out there seeming tired and wan, showing up through sheer self discipline.
Noonan, a former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, has been a longtime political observer.  She goes to Ohio, feels the “vibrations,” believes in them and then concocts a theory to explain them.  Surely, as a woman of uncommon stature in the political realm, her deeply felt feelings must count for something.
So she substitutes the question of “does Romney have a mathematical chance at winning the Presidency?” with “what do I feel at an Ohio political rally?”
The Fox And The Hedgehog
Nate Silver entitled the manifesto for his new website, What The Fox Knows.  He presents it as an allusion to an old Greek fable and the adage that, while a fox knows many things, a hedgehog knows one big thing.  But the truth is that the metaphor is much more.
Philip Tetlock spent 20 years studying the predictions of political experts and found that they were no more accurate than flipping a coin.  For all of those thousands of column lines and hundreds of hours on cable news shows, the talking heads really don’t know any more about the future than the rest of us.
Yet all experts were not equal in Tetlock’s famous study.  The hedgehog pundits, who focused on a specific area of interest, tended to perform considerably worse than the foxes, who had a much broader base of knowledge.  What’s even more interesting is that, despite being wrong more often, hedgehogs were also more confident in their judgments.
Anybody who reads Nate Silver can see that he works on the basis of prior doubt rather than prior belief.  He looks at an assertion, finds a way to test it with data and then tests it some more.  He’s not trying to be right as much as he is trying to be less wrong over time.  He aspires not to superior insight, but greater rigor.",summarize the following text: ,"Silver doesn’t look very threatening.

"Nate Silver doesn’t look very threatening.  With his spindly frame and eyeglasses, he looks more like the prototypical 98 pound weakling than an emergent media juggernaut, but he’s got a lot of people running scared nonetheless.
Whereas other pundits earn their living through a special blend of insights and access to inside sources, Silver has neither.  In fact, he bases his analysis on data that, in most cases, everyone else has yet he’s somehow able to prove experts wrong.
And that’s exactly what makes Silver so scary, not for what he does, but what he represents—the primacy of data and analysis over personal experience.  If Silver, a relative neophyte with no real experience on the political beat or in the halls of power can outperform respected pundits, then what does that say about the rest of us?
The Invasion Of The Quants
While many in the news world see Silver and his fellow data journalists as newfangled interlopers, the truth is that politics is only the most recent area where data has upended the existing order.
In his book The Quants, Scott Patterson chronicles how, starting in the early 1970’s, traders armed with computers and algorithms began dominating those who went on instinct.  Today, trading programs operate with limited day-to-day intervention and execute trades in microseconds, much faster than any human could hope to keep up with.
Since then, data analysis has bested experts in a number of fields.  In Super Crunchers, Ian Ayers explains how Orley Ashenfelter, a Princeton economist, outperformed the most influential critics with his wine equation and Sabremetrics redefined how professional baseball managers evaluated talent.
Today, data has become a big business.  The Google Flu Trends service monitors outbreaks of influenza and algorithms that evaluate creative work are being deployed in the music and film industries.  It was only a matter of time before someone like Nate Silver came along.
How Experts Fail
Most people are paid for their work, but experts are paid for their insights.  They succeed by boldly asserting claims that no one else has thought of.  With superior experience, access and intelligence, experts purport to look beyond the surface, to that which is not immediately apparent to those of us with less penetrating minds.
Unfortunately, this often leads to what Daniel Kahneman calls “substituting one question for another.”  Rather than merely looking at what the facts tell them, experts often listen to their inner voice and then go find the data needed to support their argument.  Here’s longtime pundit Peggy Noonan writing just a day before the 2012 election.
Romney’s crowds are building—28,000 in Morrisville, Pa., last night; 30,000 in West Chester, Ohio, Friday.  It isn’t only a triumph of advance planning: People came, they got through security and waited for hours in the cold. His rallies look like rallies now…
…All the vibrations are right… Something is roaring back…
Is it possible this whole thing is playing out before our eyes and we’re not really noticing because we’re too busy looking at data on paper instead of what’s in front of us? Maybe that’s the real distortion of the polls this year: They left us discounting the world around us.
And there is Obama, out there seeming tired and wan, showing up through sheer self discipline.
Noonan, a former speechwriter for Ronald Reagan, has been a longtime political observer.  She goes to Ohio, feels the “vibrations,” believes in them and then concocts a theory to explain them.  Surely, as a woman of uncommon stature in the political realm, her deeply felt feelings must count for something.
So she substitutes the question of “does Romney have a mathematical chance at winning the Presidency?” with “what do I feel at an Ohio political rally?”
The Fox And The Hedgehog
Nate Silver entitled the manifesto for his new website, What The Fox Knows.  He presents it as an allusion to an old Greek fable and the adage that, while a fox knows many things, a hedgehog knows one big thing.  But the truth is that the metaphor is much more.
Philip Tetlock spent 20 years studying the predictions of political experts and found that they were no more accurate than flipping a coin.  For all of those thousands of column lines and hundreds of hours on cable news shows, the talking heads really don’t know any more about the future than the rest of us.
Yet all experts were not equal in Tetlock’s famous study.  The hedgehog pundits, who focused on a specific area of interest, tended to perform considerably worse than the foxes, who had a much broader base of knowledge.  What’s even more interesting is that, despite being wrong more often, hedgehogs were also more confident in their judgments.
Anybody who reads Nate Silver can see that he works on the basis of prior doubt rather than prior belief.  He looks at an assertion, finds a way to test it with data and then tests it some more.  He’s not trying to be right as much as he is trying to be less wrong over time.  He aspires not to superior insight, but greater rigor.",summarize the following text: ,"Silver doesn’t look very threatening.

"What Is A Commodity Clearinghouse?
For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse. The tuna auctions in Tokyo and the tulip auctions in Holland still exist in their purest form. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, not surprisingly, evolved to become much more… but have the very same roots.
What does this have to do with our upcoming cannabis industry? Just about everything, if you are one that believes learning from past is more productive than reinventing the wheel.
As the potential centerpiece of Washington’s Marijuana Industry, an exchange solves many of the problems rule makers face in order to establish this new industry in a way that meets the expectations of voters, without handing the keys to the kingdom over to just a few big players.
Benefits of An Exchange Process For Cannabis
First of all, an exchange acts as a gateway for product to enter the marketplace. A place where lab reports can be scrutinized to allow for “bad” product to be identified and destroyed, where tracking can begin, and where the industry as a whole can be studied and scrutinized.
It also allows for a specific moment in time when taxes are due at the first tier (between the Producer and Processor) making accurate, honest and transparent tax collection possible, even without bank access. Tax collection is key, and if these large (cash) transactions take place behind closed doors, there will be no way to judge compliance.
It takes an open and transparent transaction to achieve those ends, but even more important is the role an exchange can play in curbing the black market.
There are 4 factors that must be managed in order to compete, and win, against the black market. Those are: price, convenience, selection and access.
As essentially an auction house, the exchange allows for prices to simply be controlled by supply and demand. The bidders, professional buyers (licensed as processors or distributors), will be able to adjust their offers based on current wholesale prices while taking into account the taxes that will be applied down the line.
This will lower the cost for medical marijuana as well, since growers will no longer be able to dictate their own prices – which is still a current remnant of the black-market-only era of marijuana use.
Producers will quickly learn that, as a legal business, they will no longer get paid the premium for risk that the illegal and gray-area operations historically charge, and the profitability of a production facility will eventually resemble that of any other specialty farm. If they want to garner top dollar, they will need to produce top quality product and let the market forces of supply and demand take over.
An exchange also provides the greatest access to the “second tier” for producers of any size.
Providing producer licenses a to smaller scale producers eliminates the chance that those who strive to be above-board are not forced into the black market. This also allows for unemployed, underemployed, and retired Washingtonians to make a go at earning some extra income, since compliance (taxes, tracking and lab reports) and sales and marketing (the ability to sell and compete based on quality and availability, as opposed to relationships or advertising) would be pre-built into the system.
Finally, convenience and selection to the end-user is achievable via a vibrant retail sector, supplied by processors and distributors who each have equal access to the entire range of product available statewide. This eliminates the potential problem of tier one and tier two licensees directing the best product to only a few preferred retail outlets, thereby hampering the required convenience and selection necessary to successfully diminish the viability of the black market.More Flexibility For a New Enterprise
Even with the ability to mitigate the black market, monitor and enforce compliance, and provide a transparent method of accurate tax collection, perhaps the greatest benefit of the exchange system is its ability to roll with the unexpected bumps and obstacles that accompany all new endeavors.
For example, an exchange provides a market for all grades and forms of marijuana to be sold, from top-quality flowers and leaf clippings, to stalks sold for hemp fiber. As these individual markets mature, each will eventually require their own standards and rules… and the exchange is where it all gets worked out –faster and with better results than is possible via further legislation.
Lastly, an exchange that focuses on quality and transparency would be destined to gain worldwide notoriety. Not only becoming a tourist attraction where spectators from around the globe will be drawn to watch such unique commerce take place, but it will also position Washington as the center of the legal cannabis industry, even as other states and countries start to allow for recreational use.

"It was supposed to be a cakewalk for Eric Cantor. The analysts said so. The polls said so.
Cantor felt so comfortable that the House majority leader wasn't in his Richmond, Virginia, district in June on the day of his Republican primary election.
He lost -- badly -- to a little-known economics professor in one of the great American political upsets.
How did the pundits and pollsters get it so wrong, and what does that mean for November's congressional elections? Here are five reasons to approach any prognostication with caution this time around:
1) Low turnout
While more than half of eligible voters turn out for presidential elections, the percentage drops sharply in midterm balloting for all 435 House seats and about a third of the Senate.
In Cantor's 7th District race in Virginia, well below 20% of eligible voters cast ballots on the day he lost.
Such a low turnout makes the outcome more vulnerable to unpredictable factors such as bad weather, a campaign misstep or crossover voting -- in this case, Democrats who may have voted for tea party-backed David Brat in an effort to oust Cantor, the seven-term congressman considered a possible future House Speaker.
Brat beat Cantor by more than 7,000 votes out of 65,000 cast. In 2012, the turnout for the district's Republican primary was about 47,000 votes, and there was no way to determine how many of the 18,000 additional voters this year were Democrats.
2) National mood
Most observers think the more public distaste for Congress and politics, the lower the turnout in congressional elections. By that measure, polling stations may be particularly barren come November 4.
Approval for Congress is near record lows, and a Washington Post-ABC poll in early August showed that for the first time, a majority of Americans disapproved of their own representatives.
""Americans like to vote for someone, not against someone,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""If they perceive the ballot as a choice between the lesser of two evils, that's one more excuse not to vote, and in midterms a lot of Americans don't need many excuses to simply stay at home.""
Facing such a disgruntled electorate, both parties seek to energize their respective bases to try to gain a turnout advantage.
Republicans frame the election as the chance to increase their House majority and regain control of the Senate, which would strengthen the party's ability to minimize or defeat the policies of Democratic President Barack Obama.
Democrats reach out to demographics that traditionally support them -- single women, minorities and younger voters -- but traditionally don't turn out strongly in midterm elections.
3) Polling problems
Changing dynamics make effective polling more challenging.
Cantor's pollster badly underestimated the turnout for June's primary, perhaps because he failed to anticipate Democratic crossovers and conservative disenchantment with his candidate.
Whatever the reason, difficulty in knowing who will vote makes predicting the outcome a major challenge.
Along with unorthodox tactics such as crossover voting, pollsters have a tougher time reaching a growing number of prospective voters through traditional methods.
For example, fewer young voters have land-line telephones, the traditional polling medium for decades, meaning surveys must adapt by incorporating cellphone and Internet outreach to properly reflect the population.
4) Beware of the aggregate polls
Many popular websites simply take whatever polls they can find and average them together. Some use more sophisticated mathematical models, but the principle is the same: The end product is only as good as the data it is based on.
""Computer programmers used to say, 'Garbage in, garbage out,' and that's true for virtually any mathematical model,"" Holland said. ""Let's say you have 10 polls in a state and five of them are partisan polls that are trying to spin the data for their candidate, three of them are cutting corners on their methodology, one of them is flat-out making the data up, and only one is a legitimate poll.""
The lone legitimate poll will get ""swamped"" in any aggregate model by the questionable polls, he continued, adding: ""Unfortunately, there are at least a few states where the skunky polls vastly outnumber the good ones.""
5) It's all local
""All politics is local,"" former House Speaker Tip O'Neill famously said, and that is particularly true in congressional elections.
While voting takes place in all 50 states, the competition involves the district congressional races and statewide Senate races.
That means an outcome of national significance can hinge on the result from a particular district or state.
For example, which party wins a majority in the Senate depends on the outcomes of half a dozen races, including contests involving incumbent Democrats in Arkansas and North Carolina.
""If it's sunny and warm in 48 states on Election Day and cold and rainy in Arkansas and North Carolina, control of the Senate could be determined by intensely local weather conditions,"" Holland noted.",summarize the following text: ,"It was supposed to be a cakewalk for Cantor The analysts said so.

"Indian casinos constitute 40% of the American gaming market. For a large number of American Indian nations, Indian gaming has been a key resource in facilitating tribal self-governance and self-determination. Approximately 237 tribes operate 442 Indian gaming facilities in the United States.1 Given the importance of Indian gaming to tribal governments, Congress must consider how online gaming will affect Indian tribes and insure that any federal laws enacted to regulate Internet gaming give Indian tribes a fair opportunity to share in the Internet gaming boom. The Supreme Court recognized that tribes had inherent powers to regulate gaming on their own lands in California v. Cabazon Band of Missions Indians2 in 1987. That decision produced a nationwide debate on Indian gaming that was largely resolved the next year when President Ronald Reagan signed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act into law. The Reagan administration was strongly supportive of Indian gaming even before the Cabazon decision. The Reagan Administration believed that revenues from Indian gaming could increase tribal self-sufficiency and reduce tribal dependence on federal appropriations. When it enacted IGRA, Congress recognized the exclusive right of tribes to regulate gaming on their lands and sought to promote tribal economic development, self-sufficiency and strong self government.3 Moreover, Congress refused to privatize the benefits of Indian gaming. It mandated in IGRA that gaming revenues must be used primarily for public purposes, naming five authorized uses: “(i) to fund tribal government operations or programs; (ii) to provide for the general welfare of the Indian tribe and its members; (iii) to promote tribal economic development; (iv) to donate to charitable organizations; or (v) to help fund operations of local government agencies.”4 The legal regime set forth in IGRA has allowed many tribes to prosper. The Reagan Administration’s hopes for Indian gaming have been realized, probably beyond their wildest expectations. Indian gaming has been the greatest economic engine on Indian reservations that the United States has ever seen. From 1998 to 2010, Indian Gaming grossed more than $246.2 billion nationwide.5 Consistent with the purposes specified by Congress, most of these have been used to fund tribal operations and promote the economic development and welfare of tribes and Indian people. For instance, according to the National Indian Gaming Association’s (NIGA) Economic Impact Report for 2009, 237 Indian tribes in 28 states had used Indian gaming to create new jobs, fund essential government services and rebuild communities. In 2009 tribal governments generated $26.2 billion gross revenue from gaming alone - 20% of that net revenue was dedicated to education, children and elders, culture and charity, 19% to economic development, 17% to health care, 17% to police and fire protection, 16% towards infrastructure and 11% towards housing.6 While tribal revenues allocation plans that provide for per capita payments to individual tribal members have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior and have earned a great deal of press attention, most of these payments have done little more than to increase household income and lift some Indian citizens out of poverty. In addition to gaming revenues, tribes generated $3.2 billion in gross revenue from related hospitality and entertainment services such as resorts and entertainment complexes.7 As of 2009, tribal governments had directly or indirectly generated 628,000 jobs nationwide for American Indians and others.8 As a result of gaming, tribes have experienced extensive economic development and built strong governmental infrastructures. In sum, gaming has assisted in producing strong tribal governmental infrastructures. Tribal gaming revenues have been a boon to the federal government as well. In light of the federal government’s trust responsibility to the tribes, it would likely have had to spend more on federal Indian programs in the absence of Indian gaming. In addition, Indian gaming revenues have produced tax revenues for the federal government, both directly and indirectly, and revenue shares for state governments. Although predictions are difficult, especially about the future, Internet gaming poses some magnitude of threat to the brick and mortar casino industry, including tribal casinos. Federal policy toward Internet gaming going forward should recognize the significant risk to the stable revenue stream upon which many tribes have been able to depend. Under the worst case scenario, a shift in the market for gaming away from land-based casinos and toward Internet gaming could vastly increase revenues to private and even off-shore Internet gaming companies and decrease tribal governmental revenues, plunging some tribal nations back into poverty. Federal policy must recognize and seek to mitigate this risk, so as to preserve gaming as a viable means of raising governmental resources for tribal governments.",summarize the following text: ,"Indian casinos constitute 40% of the American gaming market.

Indian gaming has been the greatest economic engine on Indian reservations that the U S has ever seen Indian Gaming grossed more than $246.2 billion nationwide most have been used to fund tribal operations and promote the economic development and welfare Indian tribes had used Indian gaming to create new jobs, fund essential government services and rebuild communities revenue was dedicated to education, children and elders, culture and charity economic development health care police and fire protection infrastructure and housing As a result of gaming, tribes have experienced extensive economic development and built strong governmental infrastructures In sum, gaming has assisted in producing strong tribal governmental infrastructures Internet gaming poses some magnitude of threat to the brick and mortar casino industry, including tribal casinos. Federal policy toward Internet gaming going forward should recognize the significant risk to the stable revenue stream upon which many tribes have been able to depend a shift in the market toward Internet gaming could vastly increase revenues to private and even off-shore Internet gaming companies and decrease tribal governmental revenues, plunging some tribal nations back into poverty"
"In July 2000, President Bill Clinton signed up to the law Plan Colombia – a programme of military aid and intervention which was, in large part, ostensibly designed to destroy the production of cocaine at source, as part of their supply-side strategy to reduce drug use. The strategy they used was a one of aerial fumigation, using the chemical Roundup Ultra[1], produced by Monsanto, the toxicity of which was enhanced by the addition of a surfactant and the concentration of which was significantly stronger than that permitted on US soil.
The result has been catastrophic for the Colombian environment. As former Colombian Vice-President Francisco Santos explained to Tom Feiling in his must-read book The Candy Machine[2], ‘You can travel over the department of Putumayo in a helicopter for half an hour and all you see is barren land, where fifteen years ago it was one of the most pristine jungles in the world’. In total, 2.6 million[3] acres of Colombian land has been sprayed from American crop-dusting planes – an area larger than Portugal. This in a country which is the second most biodiverse on earth. David Olsen, of the WWF, said this was the ecological equivalent of ‘dynamiting the Taj Mahal.’
Much of the damage, of course, is due to the cultivation of coca itself – for every one gram of cocaine produced, four square metres of tropical rain-forest has to be cleared. The production process of cocaine also produces a large amount of toxic waste – conservative estimates put it at 171,600 tons a year.  But all fumigation has served to do is to shift production from Colombia into Peru and Ecuador – which are themselves very ecologically sensitive. It’s called the ‘balloon effect’ – press down in one place, and the air rises in another. This is causing a vicious cycle of deforestation.
Demand in the western world is so strong that there will always be people who will cater to the market. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that the fumigation programme simultaneously destroys other potential cash crops: ‘the wind picks up the chemicals and they go everywhere, so a lot of the maize, yucca, and plantain turn sickly too’, a native Colombian explained to Tom Feiling.
The aerial fumigation strategy also has profound effects on the health of the people of Colombia. A commission from the European Human Rights organization found that ‘contrary to official declarations about the harmlessness of glyphosate, we were able to verify skin conditions (rashes and itching caused by the skin drying to the point of cracking) in both children and adults who were exposed directly to spraying while they worked their land or played outside their homes.’ The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, Paul Hunt, now also acknowledges as much – arguing against a replication of the programme in Ecuador.
The US have, of course, denied the detrimental health impact of the formula, citing a study[4] which appeared to vindicate them. Critics have pointed out, however, that much of the data was supplied by Monsanto. Some have even compared this to Agent Orange – the US policy of fumigating forests in Vietnam, which had a devastating impact on the health of the population, including a dramatic rise in birth defects. The cocaine smuggler Carlos Lehder’s remark that ‘Cocaine is the atomic bomb of Latin America’ seems apt.
Noam Chomsky has described this as essentially a form of chemical warfare. ‘I’ve been down to southern Colombia and seen some of it. It’s chemical warfare which is driving huge numbers of peasants off their land and destroying their crops. Colombia has the second biggest refugee problem after Sudan. And they’re driven into urban slums and multi-national corporations start coming in and mining and so on…. The number of people in Colombia killed by US tobacco is way beyond the number of Americans killed by Colombian cocaine… Do they have a right to come to the United States and carry out chemical warfare on North Carolina and Kentucky because they have a tobacco problem and it’s coming from here? You can’t even speak the words it’s so outlandish.’[5]
And all for what? The Global Commission on Drug Policy report that there has been a 27% rise in cocaine use from 1998 to 2008[6]. Production of cocaine has remained stable – with the UN estimating potential production of cocaine at 825 tonnes in 1998, and in 865 tonnes in 2008[7]. The truth is that the coca plant – from which cocaine is derived – is a remarkably durable plant. As Tom Feiling explains in the Candy Machine – it can grow for up to 40 years in very poor soils, and the Roundup can be swiftly sprayed off by the cocaleros (coca farmers). The US should have known this: the RAND corporation reported over twenty years ago that fumigation strategies were 23 times less cost-effective than prevention and treatment strategies[8].

"What Is A Commodity Clearinghouse?
For centuries commodities have been sold and distributed via auction or clearinghouse. The tuna auctions in Tokyo and the tulip auctions in Holland still exist in their purest form. The New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, not surprisingly, evolved to become much more… but have the very same roots.
What does this have to do with our upcoming cannabis industry? Just about everything, if you are one that believes learning from past is more productive than reinventing the wheel.
As the potential centerpiece of Washington’s Marijuana Industry, an exchange solves many of the problems rule makers face in order to establish this new industry in a way that meets the expectations of voters, without handing the keys to the kingdom over to just a few big players.
Benefits of An Exchange Process For Cannabis
First of all, an exchange acts as a gateway for product to enter the marketplace. A place where lab reports can be scrutinized to allow for “bad” product to be identified and destroyed, where tracking can begin, and where the industry as a whole can be studied and scrutinized.
It also allows for a specific moment in time when taxes are due at the first tier (between the Producer and Processor) making accurate, honest and transparent tax collection possible, even without bank access. Tax collection is key, and if these large (cash) transactions take place behind closed doors, there will be no way to judge compliance.
It takes an open and transparent transaction to achieve those ends, but even more important is the role an exchange can play in curbing the black market.
There are 4 factors that must be managed in order to compete, and win, against the black market. Those are: price, convenience, selection and access.
As essentially an auction house, the exchange allows for prices to simply be controlled by supply and demand. The bidders, professional buyers (licensed as processors or distributors), will be able to adjust their offers based on current wholesale prices while taking into account the taxes that will be applied down the line.
This will lower the cost for medical marijuana as well, since growers will no longer be able to dictate their own prices – which is still a current remnant of the black-market-only era of marijuana use.
Producers will quickly learn that, as a legal business, they will no longer get paid the premium for risk that the illegal and gray-area operations historically charge, and the profitability of a production facility will eventually resemble that of any other specialty farm. If they want to garner top dollar, they will need to produce top quality product and let the market forces of supply and demand take over.
An exchange also provides the greatest access to the “second tier” for producers of any size.
Providing producer licenses a to smaller scale producers eliminates the chance that those who strive to be above-board are not forced into the black market. This also allows for unemployed, underemployed, and retired Washingtonians to make a go at earning some extra income, since compliance (taxes, tracking and lab reports) and sales and marketing (the ability to sell and compete based on quality and availability, as opposed to relationships or advertising) would be pre-built into the system.
Finally, convenience and selection to the end-user is achievable via a vibrant retail sector, supplied by processors and distributors who each have equal access to the entire range of product available statewide. This eliminates the potential problem of tier one and tier two licensees directing the best product to only a few preferred retail outlets, thereby hampering the required convenience and selection necessary to successfully diminish the viability of the black market.More Flexibility For a New Enterprise
Even with the ability to mitigate the black market, monitor and enforce compliance, and provide a transparent method of accurate tax collection, perhaps the greatest benefit of the exchange system is its ability to roll with the unexpected bumps and obstacles that accompany all new endeavors.
For example, an exchange provides a market for all grades and forms of marijuana to be sold, from top-quality flowers and leaf clippings, to stalks sold for hemp fiber. As these individual markets mature, each will eventually require their own standards and rules… and the exchange is where it all gets worked out –faster and with better results than is possible via further legislation.
Lastly, an exchange that focuses on quality and transparency would be destined to gain worldwide notoriety. Not only becoming a tourist attraction where spectators from around the globe will be drawn to watch such unique commerce take place, but it will also position Washington as the center of the legal cannabis industry, even as other states and countries start to allow for recreational use.

"The 43-year-old war on drugs had never seen such a barrage of opposition as it did in 2014, with successful marijuana legalization initiatives in several U.S. states, California’s historic approval of sentencing reform for low level drug offenders and world leaders calling for the legal regulation of all drugs — all of which cement the mainstream appeal of drug policy alternatives and offer unprecedented momentum going into 2015.
Oregon, Alaska and Washington D.C. joined Colorado and Washington state in legalizing recreational marijuana and will soon start seeing the tax benefit from the estimated $41 billion that U.S. consumers spend annually on marijuana. That these states voted for legalization during a Republican romp in November elections underscores the conviction among drug policy analysts that legalization has entered the mainstream culture. It’s a matter of time, they say, before more states — and countries — follow suit.
Proof of that allure lies in the South, where conservative states had kept their distance from the marijuana legalization until recently. Legalization activists have spearheaded decriminalization and medical marijuana campaigns in Texas, Alabama and Georgia, with initial bi-partisan support in some state legislatures, and 2015 promises further momentum. California, though, remains the state to watch. If the most populous state, and the world’s 8th largest economy, legalizes cannabis use via ballot initiative during the 2016 presidential elections, as it’s expected to do, it may lead to a dramatic chain reaction across the country — following the path of the gay marriage movement — and ultimately force the federal government to revisit its policy on the drug.
And California is not idly waiting for 2016 — in November the state made a salvo on another drug war front. Voters approved Proposition 47, which will reduce penalties for low-level drug crimes. The possession of small amounts of cocaine and heroin, for example, will soon be treated as misdemeanors, not felonies — a move that is expected to affect about 40,000 offenders annually and save hundreds of millions of dollars.
The coming year will also witness implementation of a landmark decision in 2014 by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which acted on the recommendation of Attorney General Eric Holder. Starting in November, low level drug offenders — an estimated 46,000 prisoners who have spent at least 10 years in prison — will be released from prison as part of a clemency initiative to reduce sentences for non-violent drug offenders.
And there are other signs Washington may be shifting direction in the drug war. Tucked away in the $1.1 trillion spending bill is an amendment that prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to target state-run medical marijuana programs —a major shift in federal drug policy. The provision also keeps federal agents from arresting people involved in pot businesses who are complying with state laws.
Expect similar legislative efforts in Washington during 2015, say drug policy watchers. There is no way Congress will take up full legalization yet, especially with the GOP still divided on cannabis. But Congress will continue to introduce reform-centered legislation — though probably with not enough support to see passage — on issues like drug sentencing, industrial hemp use and medical access to marijuana.
Washington’s deviation will likely also reverberate through Latin America. In October at the United Nations, Assistant Secretary of State William Brownfield recognized the growing disconnect between Washington’s approach to marijuana legalization in the U.S. and abroad. He responded to growing criticism toward U.S. drug policy from Latin American leaders, who openly question why they should channel resources — and lives — against the drug trade when several U.S. states have legalized recreational cannabis. “We have to be tolerant of different countries, in response to their own national circumstances and conditions, exploring and using different national drug control policies,"" said Brownfield.
No country better exemplifies that exploration than Uruguay, which in late 2013 became the first country in the world to legalize recreational marijuana. This year saw the José Mujica slowly roll out the law, with some delays, and survive what would have been the measure’s demise, when Mujica’s ruling party won a presidential run-off against Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou, of the right-leaning National Party, who had vowed to repeal the law’s major provisions.
Countries like Mexico and Colombia have already decriminalized possession of drugs for personal use. And the coming year will see the legalization of medical cannabis debated in Colombia, Chile and Jamaica. Additionally, Otto Perez Molina, the president of Guatemala and a major drug reform proponent, has vowed to decide on marijuana legalization in early 2015.",summarize the following text: ,"The war on drugs had never seen such a barrage of opposition as it did in 2014, with successful marijuana legalization initiatives in several U.S. states which cement the mainstream appeal of drug policy alternatives and offer unprecedented momentum going into 2015.

"The attorneys general of Nebraska and Oklahoma have asked the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional Colorado’s law legalizing marijuana. The lawsuit states that, “The Constitution and the federal anti-drug laws do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local pro-drug policies and licensed-distribution schemes throughout the country which conflict with federal laws.”
Many conservatives have criticized Nebraska and Oklahoma for being “fair-weather federalists” because their claims hinge, in part, on Gonzales v. Raich, a 2005 Supreme Court decision, upholding the broad reach of Congress’s power to regulate commerce.
Conservatives’ ire instead should be directed at the Obama administration’s decision to suspend enforcement of the federal law prohibiting marijuana—a decision so warping the rule of law that the complaining states’ reliance on Raich is justified and necessary.
In 1970 Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA, listing marijuana as a Schedule I drug, and thus illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess. Nonetheless, in August 2013 the Obama administration employed its now-signature response to disfavored laws, issuing a memo directing U.S. law enforcement to refrain from using “limited investigative and prosecutorial resources” to pursue marijuana-related violations of the CSA in states that chose to regulate marijuana businesses. The new law-by-memo told states they are free to ignore the federal ban.Read more…
The Controlled Substances Act is an exercise of Congress’s express power to regulate interstate commerce. The law declares that a “major portion of the traffic in controlled substances flows through interstate and foreign commerce” and that even locally grown and sold drugs have a substantial impact on interstate commerce. Drugs manufactured, distributed or consumed within a single state cannot be tolerated because they undermine Congress’s desire to stop interstate drug trafficking.
State laws legalizing and regulating marijuana—in Colorado, Alaska, Oregon and Washington—conflict with the CSA and cripple its effectiveness. States cannot be required to enforce federal law. But as the Supreme Court held in Arizona v. United States (2012), when the federal government doesn’t enforce its own laws, states still “may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.” Colorado’s decision to legalize and regulate the sale of marijuana undermines the Controlled Substances Act, giving a major boost to all segments of that business. Indeed, in an interview this month Colorado’s attorney general, John Suthers, acknowledged that his state is “becoming a major exporter of marijuana.”
Neighboring states such as Nebraska and Oklahoma have seen a significant influx of high-potency marijuana purchased in and directed toward Colorado markets, increasing those states’ law-enforcement costs. If the CSA is a valid federal statute, the U.S. Constitution’s supremacy clause (Article VI, paragraph 2) instructs that conflicting state laws cannot be allowed to stand. This is where Raich comes in.
In Raich, individuals who used marijuana pursuant to California’s “compassionate use” law asserted that the CSA was unconstitutional as it applied to them, because Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce couldn’t reach state-sanctioned intrastate marijuana use. The Raich majority refused to create a CSA “exemption” for medicinal marijuana, reasoning that “a nationwide exemption for the vast quantity of marijuana . . . locally cultivated for personal use . . . may have a substantial impact on the interstate market for this extraordinarily popular substance.” It concluded that the CSA was a valid exercise of the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce and that “marijuana possession and cultivation ‘in accordance with state law’ cannot serve to place respondents’ activities beyond congressional reach.”
Even the pro-federalism dissent by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor —which asserted that state compassionate-use laws could peacefully coexist with the CSA—acknowledged that medical marijuana was qualitatively distinct from recreational marijuana. More specifically, Justice O’Connor believed that the relatively small population of medical marijuana users didn’t have a “substantial effect” on the interstate market for recreational marijuana—the market Congress intended to extinguish in the Controlled Substances Act.
Whatever one thinks about Raich, it is still binding precedent. Colorado’s law is not about a limited, medical-need exemption for marijuana use. It is a full-scale defiance of the CSA. There is no federalism defense to Colorado’s law, unless one believes that Congress’s power to regulate interstate commerce doesn’t include the power to regulate the buying and selling of marijuana, a commercial market that involves interstate transportation, lures sellers and consumers from other states, and now generates more than $7 million in tax revenue for Colorado every month.",summarize the following text: ,"The attorneys general have asked the Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional Colorado’s law legalizing marijuana

"A fourth and final reason the justices of the Supreme Court ought to think federalism is important is that the specific issues that the Court's federalism case law touches upon implicate serious concerns about the dangers of overweening national power. Lopez, City of Boerne, and Morrison dealt with the constitutionality, respectively, of the Gun-Free School Zones Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Violence Against Women Act--all federal statutes that sought to expand the reaches of the federal police power. Lopez, in particular, involved an attempt by Congress to expand the federal criminal law by outlawing the bringing of a gun within 1000 feet of a school, an action that had already been outlawed by more than 40 states. One issue, thus, which is inescapably raised by Lopez is the continuing federalization of the criminal law. This federalization refers to the process by which more and more ordinary state law crimes are relabeled as federal crimes by Congress in its eagerness to show voters that it is tough on crime (Calabresi 1995).
Federalizing ordinary state law crimes transfers power and work from state prosecutors to federal prosecutors, from state police forces to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and from state courts to federal courts. This process raises valid concerns about the sweeping power of the federal government and implicates genuine issues of that civil liberty which is protected by federalism. It is not too difficult in light of this to see why the Court thought the Lopez case was an appropriate one in which to draw a line. Had the Court upheld Congress's statute in Lopez, it would have been difficult to imagine any federalization of the criminal law that would not be deemed to pass constitutional muster.
City of Boerne and Morrison raise slightly more complicated issues  [*29]  because in those cases, the federal laws struck down involved novel expansions of civil rights. In City of Boerne, the Court declined to allow Congress to create a new civil right for protecting religion, which would have trumped ordinary state laws, and in Morrison the Court declined to allow Congress to create a new civil right for private acts of violence against women. In both cases, the Court's reason for declining to allow the congressional extension of the federal police power was that the states were already adequately protecting the civil rights of religious people and of women that were in question. In essence, the Court found that there was no ongoing deprivation by the states of civil rights protected by Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment that permitted congressional remedial legislation under Section 5 of that amendment.
City of Boerne and Morrison thus raise the same problem that Lopez raises because they involve congressional efforts to expand the federal police power by regulating traditional state law matters in a situation where the states are already doing a good job. Obviously, Congress cannot be allowed to federalize the law under the guise of expanding civil rights into wholly novel areas. That in essence is what the Court concluded Congress was doing in these two cases and why these portions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and the Violence Against Women Act were struck down.
My arguments above about the importance of federalism presuppose that it is important that decentralization be constitutionally mandated. One possible response to the argument thus far might be to concede that decentralization is a good thing but to contend that it ought to be done by Congress as a matter of national grace. Simply proving that decentralization is good, without more, does not establish that constitutionally mandated and judicially enforced federalism is also desirable (Rubin this volume; Rubin and Feeley 1994).
One advantage of constitutionally mandated decentralization is that it is more entrenched and is harder to dispense with than is decentralization done as a matter of national legislative grace. Requiring decentralization in a written constitution makes it more likely that it will actually occur, and that increases the chance that the benefits of decentralization will be experienced. We protect First Amendment freedoms in our written Constitution because we rightly fear that without constitutional and judicial protection, we will not get enough protection of freedom of speech and of the press. The same argument works to justify the need for constitutional and judicial protection of federalism (Calabresi 1995). Without constitutional and judicial protection of the values of decentralization, we will get too much national lawmaking and especially too much federalization of the criminal law. We need decisions like United States v. Lopez to counterbalance the enormous pressure that Congress feels to expand the federal criminal law into new areas that had traditionally been regulated by the states.",summarize the following text: ,"the Court's federalism case law touches upon overweening national power to expand the reaches of the federal police power One issue which is inescapably raised by Lopez is the continuing federalization of the criminal law federalization refers to the process by which more and more ordinary state law crimes are relabeled as federal crimes by Congress

"-I-Law important now for various reasons
Wells C. BENNETT, Fellow in National Security Law at the Brookings Institution and Managing Editor of Lawfare, AND John WALSH, Senior Associate at the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), focused on drug policy reforms, 14 [October 2014, “Marijuana Legalization is an Opportunity to Modernize International Drug Treaties,” http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2014/10/15-marijuana-legalization-modernize-drug-treaties-bennett-walsh/cepmmjlegalizationv4.pdf]
In making the case for the United States to proactively open the door to future change in the drug treaties, we have emphasized, so far, the negative value of avoiding conflict and instability. We would be remiss not to end on an equally important positive note. The political changes and incentives in play in the marijuana-policy debate open a real opportunity to demonstrate and improve the adaptability of the international legal system—a system on which the United States relies more and more.
No treaty can survive the collapse of a political consensus supporting it. And no treaty system can endure if it cannot cope with changing political conditions. Sustainability in international law depends not only on commitment but also on resilience and adaptability.
At this writing, one or two more U.S. states may be about to adopt a version of marijuana legalization. If states continue to legalize, and if the federal government continues to allow their reforms to proceed, the short run for treaty reform may come quite soon. This is why we refer to the challenge of marijuana legalization as a “stress test” for the adaptability of international law. Should legalization prove politically popular or socially successful, it will spread to more states and nations; should it spread, then one way or another both domestic and international politics will find ways to accommodate it—either by adapting formal legal commitments or by cutting new, informal channels around those commitments. The latter would weaken international law; the former would strengthen it.
Marijuana-related reform to the drug treaties offers, in several respects, good odds of achieving constructive adaptation. Reform need not entail any wholesale reconsideration of international drug policy, nor need any brand new treaty be negotiated. Modest incrementalism can do the job. In the United States, moreover, a growing political constituency, embracing members of both political parties, favors reform, so the issue is less partisan than many. Persuading the Senate to make more room for U.S. experimentation by revising an existing treaty is a lighter lift than persuading it to undertake entirely new treaty obligations. And, if the United States plays its cards right (with, as we have suggested, suitably narrow and hedged legal changes), we believe a consensus abroad for modest change could become within reach. In any case, broaching the subject relatively early on—by ruling treaty change in, now, as a possibility, instead of ruling it out as a non-starter—may itself open the door to a new international conversation about modernizing and adapting drug treaties. In other words, marijuana offers as good a chance as we are likely to see of setting a precedent for creative, consensual, and gradual adaptation of a well-established international treaty structure.
The international legal system, however suspicious of it many Americans may be, has always mattered and has never mattered more than now. For example, the campaign against ISIS and the Ukraine crisis underscore all too dramatically the continuing importance of multilateral security commitments. If anything, international law’s remit is growing as environmental, social, economic, and security problems transcend national borders. From global warming to sanctions on Iran and Russia to the campaign against terrorism and military intervention in a host of theaters, the United States and its allies increasingly rely on international agreements and commitments to legitimize and amplify joint action against common threats.
Of course, marijuana and the international narcotics treaties are only one small piece of that puzzle. But they are a highly visible piece, and they offer a real opportunity to demonstrate adaptation through international legal channels, rather than around them. Laying groundwork for manageably incremental changes—by beginning conversations with treaty partners and other constituencies about where flexibility might lie—would reaffirm American commitment to constructive adaptation, and to building consensus. Conversely, pushing the outer boundaries of the drug treaties’ flexibility could weaken the international order and damage American interests.
To put the point another way: Marijuana policy reform is a stress test that the United States and the international order should, and realistically can, pass.",summarize the following text: ,"BENNETT AND WALSH 14
