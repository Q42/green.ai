"In considering the importance of biological warfare as a subject for concern it is worthwhile to review the known existential threats. At this time this writer can identify at three major existential threats to humanity: (i) large-scale thermonuclear war followed by a nuclear winter, (ii) a planet killing asteroid impact and (iii) infectious disease. To this trio might be added climate change making the planet uninhabitable. Of the three existential threats the first is deduced from the inferred cataclysmic effects of nuclear war. For the second there is geological evidence for the association of asteroid impacts with massive extinction (Alvarez, 1987). As to an existential threat from microbes recent decades have provided unequivocal evidence for the ability of certain pathogens to cause the extinction of entire species. Although infectious disease has traditionally not been associated with extinction this view has changed by the finding that a single chytrid fungus was responsible for the extinction of numerous amphibian species (Daszak et al., 1999; Mendelson et al., 2006). Previously, the view that infectious diseases were not a cause of extinction was predicated on the notion that many pathogens required their hosts and that some proportion of the host population was naturally resistant. However, that calculation does not apply to microbes that are acquired directly from the environment and have no need for a host, such as the majority of fungal pathogens. For those types of host–microbe interactions it is possible for the pathogen to kill off every last member of a species without harm to itself, since it would return to its natural habitat upon killing its last host. Hence, from the viewpoint of existential threats environmental microbes could potentially pose a much greater threat to humanity than the known pathogenic microbes, which number somewhere near 1500 species (Cleaveland et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2001), especially if some of these species acquired the capacity for pathogenicity as a consequence of natural evolution or bioengineering.",summarize the following text: ,"it is worthwhile to review the known existential threats this writer can identify infectious disease recent decades have provided unequivocal evidence for the ability of certain pathogens to cause the extinction of entire species.

"THE COUNTRY is about to see its fiercest climate-change battle. After years of congressional inaction, President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency is applying new rules to curb greenhouse-gas emissions from cars, trucks and — most controversially — power plants, the biggest national emitters. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has said he will try to restrict the EPA if Republicans take over the Senate. Mr. Obama’s executive actions will be an issue in the 2016 presidential campaign. The EPA has drawn up the best possible policy framework under current law, and it is much better than nothing. Congress should not weaken the rules. But lawmakers could significantly improve on them. The Obama administration’s plan has three pieces. First, the EPA has persuaded carmakers to nearly double the fuel efficiency of U.S. autos, in the process cutting their carbon emissions in half. Second, the EPA placed limits on the carbon dioxide that new power plants can emit, virtually guaranteeing that no more conventional coal-fired plants will be built in the United States. Third, the EPA proposed in June a rule that would restrict the emissions of existing power plants, cutting their carbon emissions by 30 percent by 2030. The central criticism is that these rules, particularly the third, will exact extreme costs on the economy without reversing the rise in global temperatures. But critics have been citing high-cost estimates based on faulty assumptions, and the EPA figures that its power plant rule, which gives utilities many years to comply, will peak at about $9 billion per year in 2011 dollars. That’s a relative pittance in an economy that’s nearly $17 trillion and growing. In return, the EPA projects health and climate benefits outstripping costs many times over. Even if the EPA’s reckoning is significantly off, the regulations will do more good than harm — without even considering their importance in motivating other countries to act.",summarize the following text: ,"President Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency is applying new rules to curb greenhouse-gas emissions from cars, trucks and — most controversially — power plants, the biggest national emitters McConnell has said he will try to restrict the EPA if Republicans take over the Senate The Obama administration’s plan has three pieces.

"Goodman further reasons that, since there are currently few legal means to make a living in countries like Afghanistan, providing a legitimate market for such cash crops could mitigate instability, by depriving the country’s war-lords and criminal groups of the illegal narcotic profits they frequently use to undermine our national security and counterterrorism objectives involving these countries. Considering that some 23 million Americans are reported to spend an estimated $42 billion on marijuana every year, there is little doubt that the Afghan economy could benefit if Afghanis were able to legally supply their agricultural products to legitimate private markets in the U.S. The question is though, why we would think providing a legal market for marijuana in Afghanistan would somehow remove the unsavory element from the country’s drug trade. Warlords and their personal armies have a lengthy history in Afghanistan. They are part of the Afghan DNA. Today there are more than 200 key warlords controlling various territories in Afghanistan, with as many as 250,000 heavily armed, and often militarily experienced, militiamen at their disposal. The formally established Afghan government, even with the assistance of the U.S., has been unable to unarm or dismantle these groups. Why would these warlords give up the hold they currently have on the drug trade, a trade that represents their primary source of income, power and existence. Legal or illegal, these warlords and the unsavory characters that surround them are going to continue to control the drug trade in Afghanistan and, if so disposed, will continue to use the proceeds from such to finance terrorist activity and other operations creating continued instability within the region. The only thing creating a “legal” market for Afghan’s bumper cannabis crop will do is substantially increase the profits flowing to these groups, thereby enhancing the means they have available to them as they remain equally as committed to fighting the West.",summarize the following text: ,"Goodman reasons that since there are currently few legal means to make a living in Afghanistan providing a legitimate market f could mitigate instability by depriving war-lords of the illegal narcotic profits The question is  why we would think providing a legal market for marijuana in Afghanistan would somehow remove the unsavory element from the country’s drug trade.

"Am I overlooking the obvious threat that strikes fear into the hearts of so many Americans, which is terrorism? Not at all. Sure, the United States has a terrorism problem. But it is a minor threat. There is no question we fell victim to a spectacular attack on September 11, but it did not cripple the United States in any meaningful way and another attack of that magnitude is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future. Indeed, there has not been a single instance over the past twelve years of a terrorist organization exploding a primitive bomb on American soil, much less striking a major blow. Terrorism—most of it arising from domestic groups—was a much bigger problem in the United States during the 1970s than it has been since the Twin Towers were toppled.
What about the possibility that a terrorist group might obtain a nuclear weapon? Such an occurrence would be a game changer, but the chances of that happening are virtually nil. No nuclear-armed state is going to supply terrorists with a nuclear weapon because it would have no control over how the recipients might use that weapon. Political turmoil in a nuclear-armed state could in theory allow terrorists to grab a loose nuclear weapon, but the United States already has detailed plans to deal with that highly unlikely contingency.
Terrorists might also try to acquire fissile material and build their own bomb. But that scenario is extremely unlikely as well: there are significant obstacles to getting enough material and even bigger obstacles to building a bomb and then delivering it. More generally, virtually every country has a profound interest in making sure no terrorist group acquires a nuclear weapon, because they cannot be sure they will not be the target of a nuclear attack, either by the terrorists or another country the terrorists strike. Nuclear terrorism, in short, is not a serious threat. And to the extent that we should worry about it, the main remedy is to encourage and help other states to place nuclear materials in highly secure custody.",summarize the following text: ,"terrorism is a minor threat another attack of magnitude is highly unlikely in the foreseeable future there has not been a single instance over twelve years of a terrorist organization exploding a primitive bomb on American soil Terrorism was a much bigger problem in the 70s

"This kind of story is both overly optimistic and overly pessimistic about the state of the WTO. It's overly optimistic in assuming that, even if something is negotiated in Bali (and the odds aren't great of that happening), it's unlikely that the WTO will ever be the focal point for comprehensive trade talks ever again. Even getting agreement on the ""easy"" parts of Doha has been super-hard. There's very little upside to making the WTO the focal point of new talks, especially given that most of the regional and bilateral trade talks have been of the ""open regionalism"" variety. On the other hand, the ""slippery slope"" argument of the WTO losing relevance is also way overplayed. Such a statement omits two very important facts. First, even if there's no further WTO-guided liberalization, the rounds negotiated to date constitute far more liberalization than what can be achieved in the future. In other words, the WTO rules still govern a lot of trade, and further liberalization won't erode the WTO's bailiwick that much. Second, the WTO's Dispute Settlement Understanding remains the ne plus ultra of enforcement arrangements in global governance. Contrary to the WSJ story, there is zero evidence that WTO enforcement has weakened as Doha bogged down or as protectionism increased after 2008. That part of the trade system is still working pretty well. For decades, trade commentary has implicitly embraced the ""bicycle theory"" - the belief that unless multilateral trade liberalization moves ahead, the entire global trade regime will collapse because of a lack of forward momentum. The last decade -- and particularly the post-2008 period -- suggests that there are limits to that rule of thumb. It is possible for the WTO to matter less on jump-starting multilateral trade negotiations while still mattering a great deal in enforcing the rules of the game. So Bali might represent the end of multilateral trade negotiations -- but it's not the end of multilateral trade.",summarize the following text: ,"even if something is negotiated in Bali it's unlikely the WTO will ever be the focal point for comprehensive trade talks ever again Even getting agreement on the ""easy"" parts of Doha has been super-hard There's very little upside to making the WTO the focal point of new talks especially given most trade talks have been of the ""open regionalism"" variety the ""slippery slope"" argument of the WTO losing relevance is also way overplayed even if there's no further WTO-guided liberalization, the rounds negotiated to date constitute far more liberalization than what can be achieved in the future the WTO rules still govern a lot of trade, and further liberalization won't erode the WTO's bailiwick that much.

"Forecasts talk of U.S. retreat from domineering China or an inevitable U.S.-China conflict. However, enduring circumstances hold back Chinese leaders from confronting America, the regional leader. Domestic preoccupations Chinese economic growth and one-party rule require stability. And protecting Chinese security and sovereignty remains a top concern. Though China also has regional and global ambitions, domestic concerns get overall priority. President Xi Jinping is preoccupied with uncertain leadership legitimacy, pervasive corruption, widespread mass protests, and unsustainable economic practices. Beijing’s reform agenda requires strong leadership for many years. Under these circumstances, Xi was unusually accommodating in meeting President Obama in California in 2013; he seeks a new kind of major power relationship. Xi also presides over China’s greater assertiveness on territorial issues that involve the United States, but thus far Chinese probes avoid direct confrontation with the superpower. Mutual interdependence Growing economic and other U.S.-China interdependence reinforces constructive relations. Respective “Gulliver strategies” tie down aggressive, assertive, or other negative policy tendencies through webs of interdependence in bilateral and multilateral relationships. China’s insecurity in Asia Nearby Asia is China’s top foreign priority. It contains security and sovereignty issues (e.g. Taiwan) of highest importance. It is the main arena of interaction with the United States. Its economic importance far surpasses the rest of world (China is Africa’s biggest trader but it does more trade with South Korea). Asian stability is essential for China’s economic growth—the lynch pin of Communist rule. Facing formidable American presence and influence and lacking a secure periphery, China almost certainly calculates that seriously confronting the United States poses grave dangers.",summarize the following text: ,"Forecasts talk of an inevitable U.S.-China conflict However, enduring circumstances hold back Chinese leaders from confronting America Chinese economic growth and one-party rule require stability protecting Chinese security and sovereignty remains a top concern Though China has regional ambitions domestic concerns get overall priority.

In Washington v. Glucksberg n1 and Vacco v. Quill n2 the Supreme Court Justices did the right thing by rejecting a constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide (PAS) or euthanasia. n3 They also reached the correct decision in not foreclosing state legalization of these interventions. The decisions will foster a lively debate in the states about the ethics and political prudence of permitting these interventions. Although a few Justices held out hope for a more narrow constitutional right to PAS or euthanasia, the majority holdings permanently shifted the forum, the arguments, the perspective, and the justifications in the debate over PAS and euthanasia. The forum is no longer the courts, but the legislatures and public squares. The arguments are no longer about constitutional rights, but ethics and prudent policies. The perspective is no longer first person, but third per- [*984] son. And the justifications no longer appeal to individual autonomy and beneficence, but to probable social goods and harms. This is as it should be in a democracy. As the debate proceeds, however, it must be better informed. The debate needs to move away from this or that heart-wrenching case calling out for euthanasia, shake off the distortions concerning end-of-life practices that have so far informed it, and carefully examine what likely benefits and harms might result from legalization. This means that there will be even more emphasis on accurate empirical assessments of likely practices and consequences related to PAS or euthanasia. Current assumptions about PAS or euthanasia based on abstract argumentation and logical inferences will need to be tested empirically if public policy is to be prudent. Some of these assumptions already have been shattered by empirical assessment. But others will require a commitment to collect additional data to make public debate more informed.",summarize the following text: ,"(Chief, Department of Clinical Bioethics, Warren G.

"As for moral perfectionism, this would be the doctrine that a liberal state should never have truck with dubious moral means and should spare its officials the hazard of having to decide between lesser and greater evils. A moral perfectionist position also holds that states can spare their officials this hazard simply by adhering to the universal moral standards set out in human rights conventions and the laws of war. There are two problems with a perfectionist stance, leaving aside the question of whether it is realistic. The first is that articulating nonrevocable, nonderogable moral standards is relatively easy. The problem is deciding how to apply them in specific cases. What is the line between interrogation and torture, between targeted killing and unlawful assassination, between preemption and aggression? Even when legal and moral distinctions between these are clear in the abstract, abstractions are less than helpful when political leaders have to choose between them in practice. Furthermore, the problem with perfectionist standards is that they contradict each other. The same person who shudders, rightly, at the prospect of torturing a suspect might be prepared to kill the same suspect in a preemptive attack on a terrorist base. Equally, the perfectionist commitment to the right to life might preclude such attacks altogether and restrict our response to judicial pursuit of offenders through process of law. Judicial responses to the problem of terror have their place, but they are no substitute for military operations when terrorists possess bases, training camps, and heavy weapons. To stick to a perfectionist commitment to the right to life when under terrorist attack might achieve moral consistency at the price of leaving us defenseless in the face of evildoers. Security, moreover, is a human right, and thus respect for one right might lead us to betray another.",summarize the following text: ,A moral perfectionist position holds that states can spare hazard simply by adhering to universal moral standards There are two problems with a perfectionist stance articulating nonrevocable moral standards is easy.

"If either Udall or Braley loses, the game is then over. Republicans are in charge. But wait a minute: Some very unlikely scenarios might just take place that could save the day for the Democrats. No. 1 is Kansas, which I wrote about last week (Independent Greg Ormond beating Republican Sen. Pat Roberts.) No. 2, of all places, is South Dakota. There is a former three-term Republican senator, the irrepressible Larry Pressler, who very well may be a godsend for the Democrats. He is pulling votes away from the Republican candidate, former Gov. Mike Rounds. Now-Independent Pressler is definitely aiding Democrat Rick Weiland. Remember, South Dakota has sent Democrats to the U.S. Senate — James Abourezk, Tom Daschle and the retiring Tim Johnson. And, of course, George McGovern. A candidate can win this race with as little as 33 percent. There is no runoff — it's just a simple plurality. And there is even a fourth candidate, Gordon Howie. He's a conservative and probably is pulling votes away from Republican Rounds. Another nontraditional candidate is helping Democratic candidate Michelle Nunn in Georgia. Libertarian Party nominee Amanda Swafford is viewed as taking votes away from Republican David Perdue. We haven't talked about North Carolina. This is the only state where an endangered Democrat (Kay Hagan) seems to be leading in the polls. There, the savior for the Democrats is again a libertarian. He is a pizza delivery man. His name is Sean Haugh. Republican candidate Thom Tillis wishes his name was not on the ballot. If third party libertarians continue to get their names on the ballot, this is an ominous development for the Republican Party in the future. I firmly believe that they deliver close races to the Democrats. Their 5 percent to 10 percent is taking votes from the GOP. So on Tuesday, Nov. 4, you very well might pay attention to former no-names — Larry Pressler, Gordon Howie, Amanda Swafford and Sean Haugh.

"In a 2004 article “Do We Really Know That the World Trade Organization (WTO) Increases Trade?,” Andrew K. Rose finds that pairs of states belonging to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and its successor, the WTO, do not have higher trade levels than nonmember dyads. Prior to Rose’s research, the GATT and WTO were commonly perceived as significant institutions in expanding global trade. The WTO aims to promote trade, and the protestors who have attempted to disrupt every WTO ministerial meeting since 1999 in Seattle must think it promotes trade. National governments also seem to think that the WTO promotes trade, or else it is difficult to understand why they spend so much time and effort negotiating new agreements. So, what explains Rose’s counterintuitive finding? The GATT/WTO is supposed to increase trade by reducing tariffs. We argue, however, that tariffs are only one factor affecting trade flows, and often a relatively minor one. Market-protecting institutions (MPIs), which are domestic institutions that protect market activity, exert a considerable influence on international trade (Anderson and Marcouiller 2002; Anderson and van Wincoop 2004; Berkowitz, Moenius and Pistor 2006; Iwanow and Kirkpatrick 2007; Nunn 2007; Ranjan and Lee 2007). MPIs promote trade by reducing transaction costs, and because high transaction costs can prohibit trade, we argue that the relationship between GATT/WTO membership and dyadic trade is conditional on the strength of MPIs in the dyad. When MPIs are strongly developed, trade is able to flow relatively freely and GATT/WTO tariff reductions further increase trade; thus, dyads with strong MPIs are likely to see an increase in trade upon GATT/WTO accession. On the other hand, in dyads with weak MPIs, GATT/WTO membership is unlikely to promote trade because the marginally lower tariffs provided by GATT/WTO membership are unable to offset the high transaction costs associated with weak MPIs. In brief, the WTO does promote trade, but its effect is conditional on the strength of the MPIs in the dyad.",summarize the following text: ,"Rose finds pairs of states belonging to the WTO, do not have higher trade levels than nonmember dyads.

"Those contributing to the growing chorus of antihegemony and multipolarity may know they are playing a dangerous game, one that needs to be conducted with the utmost care, as French leaders did during the Cold War, lest the entire international system come crashing down around them. What they may not have adequately calculated, however, is the possibility that Americans will not respond as wisely as they generally did during the Cold War.  Americans and their leaders should not take all this sophisticated whining about U.S. hegemony too seriously. They certainly should not take it more seriously than the whiners themselves do. But, of course, Americans are taking it seriously. In the United States these days, the lugubrious guilt trip of post-Vietnam liberalism is echoed even by conservatives, with William Buckley, Samuel Huntington, and James Schlesinger all decrying American ""hubris,"" ""arrogance,"" and ""imperialism."" Clinton administration officials, in between speeches exalting America as the ""indispensable"" nation, increasingly behave as if what is truly indispensable is the prior approval of China, France, and Russia for every military action. Moreover, at another level, there is a stirring of neo-isolationism in America today, a mood that nicely complements the view among many Europeans that America is meddling too much in everyone else's business and taking too little time to mind its own. The existence of the Soviet Union disciplined Americans and made them see that their enlightened self-interest lay in a relatively generous foreign policy. Today, that discipline is no longer present.  In other words, foreign grumbling about American hegemony would be merely amusing, were it not for the very real possibility that too many Americans will forget — even if most of the rest of the world does not — just how important continued American dominance is to the preservation of a reasonable level of international security and prosperity.

"The United States must use its ""soft power"" to gain the trust and confidence of Muslims worldwide if it is to ""prevail over terrorism"", Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Friday. Opening an international security conference, Lee said one reason why many moderate Muslims are reluctant to condemn and disown religious extremists was the ""wide gap that separates the US from the Muslim world"". He said the large-scale US assistance to Indonesia, the world's biggest Muslim nation, in the aftermath of the December 26 tsunami disaster had not completely erased the resentment many Muslims feel toward the United States. ""The sources of this Muslim anger are historical and complex, but they have been accentuated in recent years by Muslim perceptions of American unilateralism and hostility to the faith,"" Lee told the audience, which included US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Lee cited a survey that found that in 2000 three quarters of Indonesians said they were ""attracted"" to the United States but that by 2003 the number had fallen to just 15 percent. Lee said US help to bring relief assistance to the tsunami victims in Indonesia had touched the hearts of many Indonesians. ""But this singular event has not eliminated the antipathy that many Muslims still feel towards the US,"" he said. He cited demonstrations worldwide, including in Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur, following a report by the US magazine Newsweek that US interrogators at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre had flushed a copy of the Koran down the toilet. Newsweek later withdrew the report, saying they could not confirm the story with their source. ""The US needs to make more use of its 'soft power' to win over international opinion, correct misperceptions and build trust and credibility, especially in the Muslim world,"" Lee said. ""In the long term this is vital if the US is to prevail over terrorism, and to maintain its position of global leadership.""",summarize the following text: ,"The United States must use its ""soft power"" to gain the trust and confidence of Muslims worldwide if it is to ""prevail over terrorism The US needs to make more use of its 'soft power' to win over international opinion, correct misperceptions and build trust and credibility, especially in the Muslim world In the long term this is vital if the US is to prevail over terrorism, and to maintain its position of global leadership."""
"Legalizing marijuana should be a top national security objective – that is, if the United States wants to minimize terrorism and border instability. How do legalizing marijuana and maintaining national security relate to each other? Well, here’s the breakdown! The United States has been waging wars with Iraq and Afghanistan for the past two decades and has tried relentlessly to stabilize both Iraq and Afghanistan by attempting to build some type of political and economic structure within each of those nations. Additionally, as the 2011 U.S. National Strategy for Counterterrorism states, the President’s top national security priority is ensuring the security of the citizens of the United States and the interests of the United States from terrorists. With that in mind, Afghanistan is the largest provider of cannabis in the world and the United States is the world’s largest consumer of cannabis. Citizens of the United States spend about $40.6 billion a year on cannabis. Therefore, if the United States legalizes cannabis, Afghanistan and its people and economy could establish a source of income by supplying the United States’ legal cannabis industry. This would create some sort of economic stability in Afghanistan and even destabilize terror groups. This is because terrorist groups are the main beneficiaries of the illegal drug trade in Afghanistan. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the terrorist groups use profits from drug trafficking to fund acts of terrorism, violence and other conflicts. The illegal drug trade in Afghanistan is supporting the ongoing influx of terror activities. Therefore, so long as marijuana is still illegal in the United States, the terrorist groups will benefit from illegal drug trafficking. However, if the United States would legalize marijuana, the illegal drug trade in Afghanistan would disappear and terrorist groups would lack funds to carry out their terror activities.",summarize the following text: ,"if the United States legalizes cannabis, Afghanistan and its people and economy could establish a source of income by supplying the United States’ legal cannabis industry.

"Congress has already kicked into gear against online gambling, and the senator leading the charge has received tens of thousands of dollars this election cycle from Adelson and his family – Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. ""Well, I don't know how much money he gave me, but I'm doing this bill because it makes sense to me to regulate chaos,"" says Graham. Last week, Graham introduced a bill Adelson's lobbyists helped write. The senator's never been a visible critic of online gambling before, but Graham says fighting it now is a win-win situation. It will make his good friend happy, and it will make social conservatives back home happy. ""Sheldon and the Baptists are one with this. The Baptists in South Carolina and Sheldon have become one person on this idea,"" says Graham. ""You know, I'm sure the people in Vegas have different financial interests, but from my point of view, this is really easy politics for me back in South Carolina.""

"Marijuana’s legalization seems much more like neoliberal privatization of markets than true liberation of them. While I do not question the decency of these first major marijuana retailers, there are legitimate concerns. Those most victimized by the state’s rabid oppression of marijuana markets will find themselves very often out of luck, as extensive background checks are required by law, and any drug felony charge is enough to exclude individuals from operating as vendors.

While new businesses boom with customers, those who formerly tried to compete in this market remain locked up in cages.

Legalization, at its best, functions as an opposition to continued state violence against drug users and possessors. It is therefore troubling that we find even after this so-called legalization, many remain shackled both by the pre-existing landscape of the market and by new regulations which prohibit them from participating in it. It is never by the political means we realize our freedom, but only a hold-back of even worse oppression. We fight an uphill battle against the incredible damage the state does.

President Obama will no doubt lobby hard against sanctions legislation. I wouldn’t be surprised to see the Democrats back off, claiming that they will revisit sanctions if no good deal has been reached when the six month negotiating period has expired.¶ If the Dems don’t fold, Obama presumably will veto the sanctions legislation. This will be a minor embarrassment for him and his Party, but no more.¶ Presumably, Iran won’t kill the interim deal if Congress passes sanctions but Obama vetoes them.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the PBS NewsHour’s chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Warner on Friday that Iran would “accept” President Barack Obama’s promise to lift sanctions in ongoing negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, rather than holding out for congressional action. Negotiations between Iran and the nations known as the P5+1 — the U.S., U.K., China, France, Russia and Germany — took place this week aimed at restricting Iran’s nuclear program. As for whether Iran would hold out for the lifting of permanent sanctions against Iran, which requires congressional action, Zarif appeared amenable to President Barack Obama lifting less restrictive sanctions instead. “We understand the constraints that President Obama is facing,” in getting Congress to act, said Zarif. “As we don’t accept them asking us to do the impossible, we will not ask them to do the impossible. “We do not interfere in the internal domestic politics of the United States. If President Obama promises us to do something, we will accept and respect his promise.”",summarize the following text: ,"(PAUL MIRENGOFF Dartmouth Law Graduate “CONGRESS CONSIDERING NEW SANCTIONS ON IRAN” DECEMBER 9, 2013 http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2013/12/congress-considering-new-sanctions-on-iran.php)

"My argument is that the ACLU's report seems to be a paradigmatic example of interest convergence.  While this report's advocacy may lead to some net gain, underlying problems will remain unsolved and efforts that further the legalization of marijuana may result in an inefficient use of political capital.  Viewing the report in this manner reveals that marijuana legalization is an indirect way to address racial disparities in arrest and incarceration rates.  There may be a benefit to this policy: the report details the high number of arrests of African Americans due to marijuana-related crimes, and arrests for these crimes would not occur if  these crimes were eliminated.  On the other hand, the legalization of marijuana would do nothing to address racial profiling by police, which is the real reason for the disparity in arrests and incarceration that prompted this report.  The political capital that would need to be spent on advancing the controversial policy of marijuana legalization could be better spent elsewhere, namely on statutes and ordinances that go beyond the limited protections provided by the Fourth Amendment and prohibit the use of race in forming probable cause or reasonable suspicion.  These statutes would have the benefits of directly addressing the problem and would apply to all prosecutions, not just prosecutions for marijuana-related crimes.  This alternate approach may also be perceived as less controversial than marijuana legalization and would be a good initial step towards trying to solve the problem.  Statutes barring race-based searches and seizures would likely run into problems if the marijuana legislation suggested by the ACLU were passed: detractors of the search and seizure statutes could argue that the problem has been solved by the marijuana legislation, or that advocates of new policies would at least need to wait and see the effects of the marijuana legislation before they could make convincing empirical arguments.",summarize the following text: ,the ACLU's report seems to be a paradigmatic example of interest convergence While this advocacy may lead to some net gain underlying problems will remain unsolved and efforts that further the legalization of marijuana result in an inefficient use of political capital the report reveals that legalization is an indirect way to address racial disparities in arrest and incarceration rates the legalization of marijuana would do nothing to address racial profiling by police which is the real reason for the disparity in arrests and incarceration that prompted this report The political capital that would need to be spent on advancing the controversial policy of marijuana legalization could be better spent elsewhere on statutes and ordinances that go beyond the limited protections provided by the Fourth Amendment and prohibit the use of race in forming probable cause or reasonable suspicion These statutes directly address the problem and would apply to all prosecutions not just prosecutions for marijuana-related crimes This approach may be perceived as less controversial than legalization and would be a good initial step towards trying to solve the problem Statutes barring race-based searches and seizures would run into problems if marijuana legislation were passed detractors of the search and seizure statutes argue that the problem has been solved by marijuana legislation or that advocates of new policies need to wait and see the effects of the marijuana before they could make convincing arguments

Cari Mitchell is writing on behalf of the English Collective of Prostitutes NO: Legalising prostitution does not protect those involved but rather acts to expand the sex industry and normalise the exploitation of women. This has been proven in other jurisdictions such as the Netherlands. A woman seldom finds herself involved in prostitution as a result of unlimited choices, but rather as a consequence of very constrained circumstances. Prostitution is a survival strategy. By legalising the practice there is a failure to acknowledge that prostitution preys on particularly vulnerable individuals. Women in prostitution suffer violence or the threat of violence on a regular basis. Legalisation does not protect the women from violence, rape and murder, which are endemic in the sex industry and are understood to be ""occupational hazards"".

"Loss of tropical forests and changes in land-use/land-cover are of growing concern worldwide. Although knowledge exists about the institutional context in which tropical forest loss is embedded, little is known about the role of social institutions in influencing regeneration of tropical forests. In the present study we used Landsat images from southern Madagascar from three different years (1984, 1993 and 2000) and covering 5500 km2, and made a time-series analysis of three distinct large-scale patterns: 1) loss of forest cover, 2) increased forest cover, and 3) stable forest cover. Institutional characteristics underlying these three patterns were analyzed, testing the hypothesis that forest cover change is a function of strength and enforcement of local social institutions. The results showed a minor decrease of 7% total forest cover in the study area during the whole period 1984–2000, but an overall net increase of 4% during the period 1993–2000. The highest loss of forest cover occurred in a low human population density area with long distances to markets, while a stable forest cover occurred in the area with highest population density and good market access. Analyses of institutions revealed that loss of forest cover occurred mainly in areas characterized by insecure property rights, while areas with well-defined property rights showed either regenerating or stable forest cover. The results thus corroborate our hypothesis. The large-scale spontaneous regeneration dominated by native endemic species appears to be a result of a combination of changes in precipitation, migration and decreased human population and livestock grazing pressure, but under conditions of maintained and well-defined property rights. Our study emphasizes the large capacity of a semi-arid system to spontaneously regenerate, triggered by decreased pressures, but where existing social institutions mitigate other drivers of deforestation and alternative land-use.",summarize the following text: ,"Loss of tropical forests are of growing concern worldwide , little is known about the role of regeneration of tropical forests Institutional characteristics were analyzed, testing the hypothesis that forest cover change is a function of strength of local social institutions The results showed a minor decrease of 7% total forest cover during 1984–2000  but an overall net increase of 4% during the period 1993–2000 a stable forest cover occurred in the area with highest population density and good market access The large-scale spontaneous regeneration dominated by native endemic species appears to be a result of a combination of changes in precipitation, migration under conditions of maintained and well-defined property rights Our study emphasizes the large capacity of a semi-arid system to spontaneously regenerate"

The debate over marijuana is reminiscent of debates surrounding the culture wars. Armed with enough plausible evidence to support their sides, the partisans are not going to give ground. n250 Rather than weighing in on that never-ending story, I have focused on a different point. [*90] Marijuana is big business, largely untaxed, and remarkably resistant to eradication efforts. n251 We are shortsighted not to tax a business worth billions of dollars. And viewed objectively, the potential to tax marijuana may give legalization efforts the final push. n252 As a result, questions about what we want a post-legalization world to look like are far more interesting than the old pro and con debate. My hope is the policymakers will begin that conversation in earnest sooner rather than later. As I suggested above, an advantage of the legislative process over the initiative process is that the legislative process can involve greater transparency and can accommodate legitimate objections of opponents. n253 I would urge law enforcement and other traditional prohibitionists to come to the table to voice their legitimate concerns. We ended up with Proposition 215 - our version of the Trojan horse - because of then-Governor Wilson's reflexive tough-on-crime stance and his resulting veto of AB 1529. n254 Similarly, hard-line local law enforcement efforts have hindered reasonable regulation of medical marijuana. n255 Members of law enforcement do raise legitimate concerns. For example, what about crime in neighborhoods where dispensaries have opened? n256 What about drug-impaired drivers? n257 Cooperation between law enforcement and medical marijuana providers has reduced or eliminated the parade of horribles raised by marijuana opponents, like rampant crime in neighborhoods with dispensaries. n258 My hope is that this symposium can be part of a more sensible debate about how, not whether, to legalize and regulate marijuana.",summarize the following text: ,The debate over marijuana is reminiscent of the culture wars the partisans are not going to give ground the potential to tax marijuana may give legalization efforts the final push questions about what we want a post-legalization world to look like are far more interesting than the old pro and con debate My hope is a more sensible debate about how not whether to legalize and regulate marijuana
"At all events, it is better to be controlled by someone else than by oneself.  Better to be oppressed, exploited, persecuted and manipulated by someone other than oneself.
In this sense the entire movement for liberation and emancipation, inasmuch as it is predicated on a demand for greater autonomy – or, in other words, on a more complete introjection of all forms of control and constraint under the banner of freedom – is a regression. Whatever it may be that comes to us from elsewhere, even the worst exploitation, the very fact that it comes from elsewhere is positive. This is why alienation has its advantages, even though it is so often denounced as the dispossession of the self, with the other treated in consequence as an age-old enemy holding the alienated part of us captive. The inverse theory, that of disalienation, is equally simplistic, holding as it does that the subject merely has to reappropriate his alienated will and his alienated desire. From this perspective everything that befalls the subject as a result of his own efforts is good, because it is authentic; while everything that comes from outside the subject is dubbed inauthentic, merely because it does not fall within the sphere of his freedom.
Exactly the opposite position is the one that has to be stressed, while at the same time broadening the paradox. For just as it is better to be controlled by someone else rather than by oneself, it is likewise always better to be made happy, or unhappy, by someone else rather than by oneself. It is always better to depend in life on something that does not depend on us. In this way I can avoid any kind of servitude, I am not obliged to submit to something that does not depend on me – including my own existence. I am free of my birth – and in the same sense I can be free of my death. There has never been any true freedom apart from this one.

"While Deleuze and Guattari use many authors and concepts, this is never done in an academic fashion aimed at persuading the reader. Rather, they use these names and ideas as effects that traverse their analyses, generating ever new effects, as points of reference indeed, but also as points of intensity and signs pointing a way out: points-signs that offer a multiplicity of solutions and a variety of directions for a new style of politics. Such an approach carries much along with it, in the course of its flow, but it also leaves much behind. Chunks of Marx and Freud that cannot keep up with the fast current will be left behind, buried or forgotten, while everything in Marx and Freud that has to do with how things and people and desires actually flow will be kept, and added to the infernal machine evoked above. This political analysis of desire, this schizoanalysis, becomes a mighty tool where schizophrenia as a process-the schiz-serves as a point of departure as well as a point of destination. Like Laing, they encourage mankind to take a journey, the journey through ego-loss. They go much further than Laing on this point, however. They urge mankind to strip itself of all anthropomorphic and anthropological armoring, all myth and tragedy, and all existentialism, in order to perceive what is nonhuman in man, his will and his forces, his transformations and mutations. The human and social sciences have accustomed us to see the figure of Man behind every social event, just as Christianity taught us to see the Eye of the Lord looking down upon us. Such forms of knowledge project an image of reality, at the expense of reality itself. They talk figures and icons and signs, but fail to perceive forces and flows. They blind us to other realities, and especially the reality of power as it subjugates us.

"In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it is difficult to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem (Brock 1997, Waever 1995). Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ in dealing with the issue as well as to a shift in institutional localization towards ‘security experts’ (Bigot 2006), such as the military and police. Methods and instruments associated with these security organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the discourse on ‘what to do’. A good example of securitization was the period leading to the Cold War (Guzzini 2004 ). Originally a political conflict over the organization of societies, in the late 1940s, the East-West confrontation became an existential conflict that was overwhelmingly addressed with military means, including the potential annihilation of humankind. Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout most of the Cold War, secondary to improving military capabilities. Climate change could meet a similar fate. An essentially political problem concerning the distribution of the costs of prevention and adaptation and the losses and gains in income arising from change in the human environment might be perceived as intractable, thus necessitating the build-up of military and police forces to prevent it from becoming a major security problem. The portrayal of climate change as a security problem could, in particular, cause the richer countries in the global North, which are less affected by it, to strengthen measures aimed at protecting them from the spillover of violent conflict from the poorer countries in the global South that will be most affected by climate change. It could also be used by major powers as a justification for improving their military preparedness against the other major powers, thus leading to arms races.",summarize the following text: ,"when a problem is securitized it is difficult to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ as well as to a shift in security experts’ Methods associated with these security organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the discourse on ‘what to do’.

"It looks like good news, but it's not. The US has recorded a sharp fall in its greenhouse gas emissions from energy use. Thanks to a rise in the use of natural gas, emissions are at their lowest since 1992. The fall will boost the natural gas industry, but in reality the emissions have simply been exported.¶ According to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA), energy-related CO2 emissions in the first quarter of 2012 were the lowest in two decades. Emissions are normally high between January and March because people use more heating in the winter, but last winter was mild in the US.¶ The EIA says that an increase in gas-fired power generation, and a corresponding decline in coal-fired, contributed to the fall in emissions. Burning natural gas produces fewer emissions than burning coal, and natural gas is currently unusually cheap in the US thanks to a glut of shale gas extracted by hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"".¶ If gas companies continue to expand their shale gas operations, the US could generate even more electricity from gas, and its emissions could fall for several years, says Kevin Anderson of the University of Manchester, UK.¶ However, this will not slow down climate change. US coal consumption has fallen, but production is holding steady and the surplus is being sold to Asia. As a result, the US is effectively exporting the coal-related emissions.¶ ""Gas is less bad than burning the coal, but only if you keep the coal in the ground,"" Anderson says.¶ Proponents of natural gas argue that it is a ""transition fuel"" that we can burn for a few years while we install low-carbon infrastructure such as wind farms and nuclear power stations.¶ That viewpoint looks increasingly untenable. ""If we want even an outside chance of [limiting global warming to] 2 °C, there is no emission space for gas,"" Anderson says. In order to hit the 2 °C target, global emissions need to peak by 2020 before dropping again, which means making a rapid transition to low-carbon energy.",summarize the following text: ,"It looks like good news, but it's not The US has recorded a sharp fall in its emissions Thanks to natural gas The fall will boost the natural gas industry, but in reality the emissions have simply been exported the US is exporting the coal emissions ""If we want even an outside chance of [limiting global warming to] 2 °C, there is no emission space for gas,"" Anderson says.

The Nevada regulations result not only in a system that reinforces the stigmatization of prostitutes and denies them their most basic rights, but also creates a working environment and conditions that are so unattractive that legal brothels are hard pressed to find women who will work in them. It is for good reason that prostitutes in general prefer to work in illegal venues.

"In contrast to the social, political, and legal changes advocated by Langton, MacKinnon, and Matsuda, Butler offers a far more dubious plan for resistance. In a recent review of a number of Butler's books, Martha Nussbaum argues that this failure to provide an account of resistance is one of Butler's most significant problems. According to Nussbaum, even if we grant Butler's claim that the ubiquitousness of the structure of gender should be resisted through ""subversive and parodic acts,"" two important questions remain: ""What would the acts of resistance be like, and what would we expect them to accomplish?""' Resistance, in terms of responding to harmful speech, seems to involve restaging and resignifying certain words that otherwise would be injurious.

Butler fails to offer any guidance about how to distin guish speech that is oppressive (and that reinforces social hierarchy) from speech that is offensive or upsetting to an individual for some other reason. Nussbaum points out that unlike other feminists who have relied on ""ideas such as non-hierarchy, equality, dignity, autonomy . . . to indicate a direction for actual politics,' Butler does not explain what is supposed to guide one's decisions about what to resist. In the absence of any discussion of the goals of resistance—or of politics, more generally it is hard to know what would count as desirable change and what would reinforce the status quo. As Nussbaum notes, Butler seems to think that we need to ""wait to see what the political struggle itself throws up, rather than prescribe in advance to its participants.""' On this issue, Butler's position echoes that of another post structuralist theorist, Wendy Brown. According to Brown, politics is about struggle, and political change proceeds in the absence of normative conceptions.' Rather than defend this view of politics, however, Butler simply seems to assume it, and she proceeds under the assumption that employing any normative critique would inevitably reinforce current social norms.",summarize the following text: ,"Butler offers a far more dubious plan for resistance Nussbaum argues that this failure to provide an account of resistance is one of Butler's most significant problems even if we grant Butler's claim that the ubiquitousness of the structure of gender should be resisted through ""subversive and parodic acts,"" two important questions remain: ""What would the acts of resistance be like, and what would we expect them to accomplish?""'

"A. Decriminalization Decriminalizing prostitution is not the same as legalizing prostitution. With decriminalization, there would be no regulations or standards put in place. Simply put, the act of buying or selling sex would not be a crime, leaving prostitutes free to control their business without the interference of the government. n160 The majority of developed countries today do not criminalize prostitution, although many do prohibit running brothels, pimping, and public solicitation. n161 Countries that have decriminalized prostitution have found [*713] that many of the problems that have resulted from the criminalization of prostitution have been reduced or eliminated. n162 Prostitutes would no longer have a fear of criminal convictions if prostitution were not illegal, giving them the freedom to report abuse and crimes perpetrated against them. Eliminating the threat of prosecution and offering police protection would also reduce the need for pimps, in turn, reducing the number of women exploited by pimps.

"In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it is difficult to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem (Brock 1997, Waever 1995). Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ in dealing with the issue as well as to a shift in institutional localization towards ‘security experts’ (Bigot 2006), such as the military and police. Methods and instruments associated with these security organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the discourse on ‘what to do’. A good example of securitization was the period leading to the Cold War (Guzzini 2004 ). Originally a political conflict over the organization of societies, in the late 1940s, the East-West confrontation became an existential conflict that was overwhelmingly addressed with military means, including the potential annihilation of humankind. Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout most of the Cold War, secondary to improving military capabilities. Climate change could meet a similar fate. An essentially political problem concerning the distribution of the costs of prevention and adaptation and the losses and gains in income arising from change in the human environment might be perceived as intractable, thus necessitating the build-up of military and police forces to prevent it from becoming a major security problem. The portrayal of climate change as a security problem could, in particular, cause the richer countries in the global North, which are less affected by it, to strengthen measures aimed at protecting them from the spillover of violent conflict from the poorer countries in the global South that will be most affected by climate change. It could also be used by major powers as a justification for improving their military preparedness against the other major powers, thus leading to arms races.",summarize the following text: ,"when a problem is securitized it is difficult to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ as well as to a shift in security experts’ Methods associated with these security organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the discourse on ‘what to do’.

"Impediments to trade finance I. REFERENCE INFORMATION The supply of trade finance continues to be constrained by many of the same issues reported in the previous ADB survey (See Figure 70). The three top issues that were cited as “significant” impediments were all characteristics of issuing banks. These included “AML/KYC requirements” (69%), “issuing bank’s low credit ratings” (59%), and “previous dispute or unsatisfactory performance of issuing banks” (55%). The continued mention of these issues suggests that markets alone are not meeting demand and there is a role to be played by development banks and others to help improve the standing of local banks.  Financial crimes (AML/KYC) compliance requirements affect SMEs and Africa disproportionately AML/KYC requirements stood out as the major limiter to trade finance. They are reported to have led to declined transactions in 68% of banks (See Figure 71). Globally, Africa was the region that was most negatively impacted by these requirements (See Figure 72). Among firm types, SMEs were the most negatively impacted (See Figure 74). While onerous AML/KYC requirements led banks to decline individual transactions, they also resulted in complete relationship termination in 31% of respondent banks (See Figure 73). Compliance with these requirements is important – banks do not want to be used for criminal purposes. However, the compliance is resource intensive and appears to be impacting access to trade finance, especially among SMEs and companies in developing countries. The cost of compliance for one counterparty has been cited as high as $75,000. This cost is compounded by a lack of harmonization between jurisdictions, which was cited by 70% of respondents as a problem (See Figure 75). This suggests that there are some measures regulators could take to reduce unintended consequences of compliance that contribute to trade finance gaps that lower growth and job creation.",summarize the following text: ,Impediments to trade finance The three top issues that were cited as “significant” impediments were all characteristics of issuing banks.

"Goodman further reasons that, since there are currently few legal means to make a living in countries like Afghanistan, providing a legitimate market for such cash crops could mitigate instability, by depriving the country’s war-lords and criminal groups of the illegal narcotic profits they frequently use to undermine our national security and counterterrorism objectives involving these countries. Considering that some 23 million Americans are reported to spend an estimated $42 billion on marijuana every year, there is little doubt that the Afghan economy could benefit if Afghanis were able to legally supply their agricultural products to legitimate private markets in the U.S. The question is though, why we would think providing a legal market for marijuana in Afghanistan would somehow remove the unsavory element from the country’s drug trade. Warlords and their personal armies have a lengthy history in Afghanistan. They are part of the Afghan DNA. Today there are more than 200 key warlords controlling various territories in Afghanistan, with as many as 250,000 heavily armed, and often militarily experienced, militiamen at their disposal. The formally established Afghan government, even with the assistance of the U.S., has been unable to unarm or dismantle these groups. Why would these warlords give up the hold they currently have on the drug trade, a trade that represents their primary source of income, power and existence. Legal or illegal, these warlords and the unsavory characters that surround them are going to continue to control the drug trade in Afghanistan and, if so disposed, will continue to use the proceeds from such to finance terrorist activity and other operations creating continued instability within the region. The only thing creating a “legal” market for Afghan’s bumper cannabis crop will do is substantially increase the profits flowing to these groups, thereby enhancing the means they have available to them as they remain equally as committed to fighting the West.",summarize the following text: ,"Goodman reasons that since there are currently few legal means to make a living in Afghanistan providing a legitimate market f could mitigate instability by depriving war-lords of the illegal narcotic profits The question is  why we would think providing a legal market for marijuana in Afghanistan would somehow remove the unsavory element from the country’s drug trade.

"Now, the United States, NATO, and the Afghan government itself are gambling that the rest of the country's 344,000 security forces are also ready – or ready enough – to take the lead in defending the entire nation from Taliban forces and Islamist insurgents. As of June 18, NATO turned over to the Afghans the security lead for 100 percent of the country, and US and NATO troops officially shifted to an advise-and-assist role throughout Afghanistan – a role set to draw to a close with the end of NATO's combat mission in December 2014. Evidence is mixed as to the readiness of Afghanistan's Army soldiers and National Police to assume the lead in planning and fighting the war – with the summer combat season likely to be the first big test. There's been progress, to be sure. Most of the Afghan Army brigades – as many as 20 of 26, NATO officials claim – are capable of working on their own, up from one a year ago. And the Afghan people are becoming more confident in the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), polls show. ""The people are getting more confident, and part of that is what they have seen from the ANSF"" in the initial weeks of the summer fighting season, says Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, chairman of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program. How ready the Afghan forces actually need to be may depend in part on reconciliation talks expected to begin soon between the government of President Hamid Karzai and representatives of the Taliban. Qatar has agreed to host the negotiations, which Mr. Karzai announced June 18 and which US officials described as an ""Afghan-led, Afghan-owned initiative."" If talks proceed apace – Karzai was already expressing misgivings about the talks the day after announcing them – fighting and violence on the ground in Afghanistan may diminish, easing the demands on the Afghan government's forces and perhaps smoothing the path to a US-NATO exit, some American officials have suggested.",summarize the following text: ,"the United States, NATO, and the Afghan government are gambling that the country's security forces are ready or ready enough to take the lead in defending the entire nation from Taliban forces and Islamist insurgents There's been progress Most of the Afghan Army brigades are capable of working on their own the Afghan people are becoming more confident in the A N S F The people are getting more confident  If talks proceed apace fighting and violence on the ground in Afghanistan may diminish, easing the demands on the Afghan government's forces and perhaps smoothing the path to a US-NATO exit"
"Prophets who read and pronounce upon these apocalyptic signs—the ‘Cassandras of cyber warfare’ (Rid, 2012: 6)—do not, like their religious counterparts, restrict themselves to specific dates and times upon which terrible events will occur, so need not excuse themselves from incorrect predictions; consequently, they can never be wrong. However, they do have in common talents as ‘masterful bricoleurs, skilfully recasting elements and themes within the constraints of their respective traditions and reconfiguring them to formulate new, meaningful endtimes scenarios’ (Wojcik, 1997: 148). Specific vectors of ‘cyber insecurity’ may change, and timescales expand and contract, but the certainty in apocalypse remains unwavering. ‘Apocalyptic intensity’ is maintained and heightened further by making continued ‘imminent but indeterminate’ predictions, legitimising a constant state of readiness in which adherents ‘feel themselves to be standing poised on the brink of time’ (Bromley, 1997: 36). In fact, it is always ‘only a matter of time’ before a ‘cyber-apocalypse’ occurs (Gable, 2010). This uncertainty is shared with other forms of security, which thrive on a ‘denotative imprecision …. simultaneous appeal to the hard and the vacuous, the precise and the imprecise …. vague generalities about everything and nothing’ (Walker, 1997: 63). This epistemic tension is partially resolved by reading the signs of cyber war as corroboration of a deterministic ‘script’ of the future (Robbins and Palmer, 1997: 5). When events and scenarios converge, the narrative of cyber war gains explanatory power in its own right. In periods of ‘thickened history’ like this, it becomes ever more difficult to comprehend these events—‘to see the wood for the trees’, as it were—and they become part of their own causal structure (Beissinger, 2002: 27). In this case, the impression is that if cyber war is not already occurring, it very soon will be.",summarize the following text: ,"Prophets who read and pronounce upon these apocalyptic signs do not restrict themselves to specific dates and times upon which terrible events will occur, so need not excuse themselves from incorrect predictions; consequently, they can never be wrong Specific vectors of ‘cyber insecurity’ may change, and timescales expand and contract, but the certainty in apocalypse remains unwavering Apocalyptic intensity’ is maintained and heightened further by making continued ‘imminent but indeterminate’ predictions, legitimising a constant state of readiness This uncertainty is shared with other forms of security, which thrive on a ‘denotative imprecision …. simultaneous appeal to the precise and the imprecise When events and scenarios converge, the narrative of cyber war gains explanatory power in its own right."

The Nevada regulations result not only in a system that reinforces the stigmatization of prostitutes and denies them their most basic rights, but also creates a working environment and conditions that are so unattractive that legal brothels are hard pressed to find women who will work in them. It is for good reason that prostitutes in general prefer to work in illegal venues. Nevada’s policies altogether disfranchise prostitutes as citizens and rights holders, violate them as workers and persons, and promote dangerous client expectations, all in order to control the “victimizing” prostitute. Nowhere is the importance of conceptual constructs to the construction of policy more evident. Systems of legalization not only promote such representations of prostitutes but carry along, on this tide of misogynistic control, a correlating contempt for non-prostitute women. In Nevada, various unwritten rules circumscribe the behavior of non-prostitute women. As Pillard Notes: One of the most curious unwritten rules is that [in Winnemucca] no non-establishment female can visit any of the brothels or even drive through the area. [Winnemucca] police chief [Lee] Jones told in an interview that this rule was enforced to protect customers of these brothels. Apparently there is some concern that an angry wife could drive through the Line [a public road] looking for her husband’s car. Like criminalization, legalization embodies and perpetuates the continued stigmatization of the prostitute and maintains the correlative status of nonprostitute women. It violates bodily autonomy and actively worsens the quality of life of prostitutes, making most of them criminals for noncompliance, and it promotes the spread of STDs through unrealistic expectations.

"“Oil prices at about $100 a barrel is at a sweet spot,” said Paul Bledsoe, senior fellow in the Climate and Energy Program at the German Marshall Fund. “It’s high enough to incentivize remarkable investment in new production techniques and equally large investments in efficiency improvements. And the underlying factor of relatively modest economic growth seems to be with us for quite a while.” Predictions about oil and gasoline prices are precarious when there are so many political and security hazards. But it is likely that the world has already entered a period of relatively predictable crude prices. Even at their highest point in late summer, oil prices remained roughly 25 percent below levels of five years ago, not counting inflation, and gasoline prices on Labor Day weekend were at multiyear lows. And while oil slightly above $100 a barrel oil and nearly $3.50-a-gallon gasoline are high by historical measures, they are at a surprisingly benign level given the on-and-off disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa over the last three years. No doubt there will still be bumps like this summer’s. But there are reasons to believe the inevitable tensions in oil-producing countries will be manageable over at least the next few years, because the world now has sturdier shock absorbers than at any time over at least the last decade. The new oil equation combines multiple factors that span the globe, and most promise to be more permanent than the lackluster performance of the global economy, which no doubt has suppressed energy demand. On the supply side, more oil production in the United States, Canada, Iraq and Saudi Arabia has compensated for the loss of exports from Iran, Libya and other trouble spots. The spread of American shale-drilling technology and skill to developing countries promises to raise oil production around the world, particularly in non-OPEC countries with large untapped shale fields like Mexico, Argentina, China, Australia and Russia.",summarize the following text: ,"Oil prices at about $100 a barrel is at a sweet spot the underlying factor of relatively modest economic growth seems to be with us for quite a while Predictions about oil prices are precarious when there are so many political and security hazards the world has already entered a period of relatively predictable crude prices Even at their highest point oil prices remained 25 percent below levels of five years ago and prices on Labor Day weekend were at multiyear lows while oil slightly above $100 are high by historical measures, they are at a surprisingly benign level given the on-and-off disruptions in the Middle East and North Africa over the last three years.

"Marijuana’s legalization seems much more like neoliberal privatization of markets than true liberation of them. While I do not question the decency of these first major marijuana retailers, there are legitimate concerns. Those most victimized by the state’s rabid oppression of marijuana markets will find themselves very often out of luck, as extensive background checks are required by law, and any drug felony charge is enough to exclude individuals from operating as vendors. TakePart magazine notes in an article that even as weed is legalized, those in prison for the crime of possessing or selling marijuana will remain there. While new businesses boom with customers, those who formerly tried to compete in this market remain locked up in cages. The drug war has affected millions during its hellish tear through Americans’ lives and culture, but it has always been particularly racialized and classist. This leaves many black, Hispanic and poor individuals with a permanent hex affixed to them that these laws do not address. Like with the beltway libertarian conception of privatization, legalization picks the winners of the weed market from those who were lucky enough to not find themselves on the wrong side of the law and who already have access to the capital to invest into this expensive business. Legalization, at its best, functions as an opposition to continued state violence against drug users and possessors. It is therefore troubling that we find even after this so-called legalization, many remain shackled both by the pre-existing landscape of the market and by new regulations which prohibit them from participating in it. It is never by the political means we realize our freedom, but only a hold-back of even worse oppression. We fight an uphill battle against the incredible damage the state does. And now facing the age of Big Marijuana, we might be shocked to find the sorts of restrictions many established pot shops favor. In order to delegitimize street dealers, we have to treat them as inherently dangerous and volatile.",summarize the following text: ,"Marijuana’s legalization seems much more like neoliberal privatization of markets than true liberation of them the decency of these even as weed is legalized, those in prison for the crime of possessing or selling marijuana will remain there those who formerly tried to compete in this market remain locked up in cages. it has always been particularly racialized and classist.

"Driven by Mexico, Citigroup’s Latin-American consumer banking revenue grew 7% year-over-year in the third quarter to $2.4 billion, while the bank’s revenue in Asia was down. “We think that Mexico is extremely well-poised for growth,” Pandit said on Citigroup’s earnings conference call. “I was just there not too long ago and with the leadership change there in addition to prospects for reforms and what you are seeing on the ground—that is a high spot definitely.” Citigroup’s stock was up 4% on Monday. Not too long ago, the idea that big-shot American CEOs would be touting Mexico would have seemed unlikely. When the financial crisis hit the U.S. in 2008, FORBES predicted a “Mexican Meltdown.” The explosion of the drug war between the Mexican drug cartels and the government, coupled with the sure-to-come drop in exports to the contracting U.S. economy, seemed like it would derail Mexico again and ensure that other emerging markets like Brazil would keep passing it by. The U.S. Joint Forces Command lumped Mexico in the same category as Pakistan and worried it was becoming a failed state. Mexico’s economy was hit very hard by the financial crisis and its recession was severe, but its recovery miraculously has been even stronger. Even with the weak U.S. recovery and the ongoing drug violence, Mexico has boomed. Top officials in the Mexican government predict the country’s economic growth could reach 5% in 2012, after gross domestic product increased by 3.9% and 5.5% in the last two years.

"Settler colonialism is the specific formation of colonialism in which the colonizer comes to stay, making himself [or herself] the sovereign, and the arbiter of citizenship, civility, and knowing. Patrick Wolfe (2006) argues that settler colonialism “destroys to replace,” (p. 338) operating with a logic of elimination. “Whatever settlers may say—and they generally have a lot to say,” Wolfe observes, “the primary motive for elimination is not race (or religion, ethnicity, grade of civilization, etc.) but access to territory” (ibid., parentheses original). The logic of elimination is embedded into every aspect of the settler colonial structures and its disciplines—it is in their DNA, in a manner of speaking. Indeed invasion is a structure, not an event (p. 402). The violence of invasion is not contained to first contact or the unfortunate birthpangs of a new nation, but is reasserted each day of occupation. Thus, when we write about settler colonialism in this article, we are writing about it as [is] both an historical and contemporary matrix of relations and conditions that define life in the settler colonial nation-state, such as the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, South Africa, Chinese Tibet, and others. In North America, settler colonialism operates through a triad of relationships, between the (white [but not always]) settlers, the Indigenous inhabitants, and chattel slaves who are removed from their homelands to work stolen land. At the crux of these relationships is land, highly valued and disputed. For settlers to live on and profit from land, they must eliminate Indigenous peoples, and extinguish their historical, epistemological, philosophical, moral and political claims to land. Land, in being settled, becomes property. Settlers must also import chattel slaves, who must be kept landless, and who also become property, to be used, abused, and managed.",summarize the following text: ,"Settler colonialism is the specific formation of colonialism in which the colonizer comes to stay, making himself [or herself] the sovereign, and the arbiter of citizenship, civility, and knowing colonialism “destroys to replace,” operating with a logic of elimination Whatever settlers may say the primary motive for elimination is access to territory The logic of elimination is embedded into every aspect of the settler colonial structures and its disciplines invasion is a structure, not an event The violence of invasion is not contained to first contact but is reasserted each day of occupation settler colonialism [is] both an historical and contemporary matrix of relations and conditions that define life in the settler colonial nation-state such as the U S In North America, settler colonialism operates through a triad of relationships, between the settlers, the Indigenous inhabitants, and chattel slaves who are removed from their homelands to work stolen land At the crux of these relationships is land For settlers to live on and profit from land, they must eliminate Indigenous peoples, and extinguish their historical, epistemological, philosophical, moral and political claims to land Land, in being settled, becomes property.

"In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it is difficult to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem (Brock 1997, Waever 1995). Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ in dealing with the issue as well as to a shift in institutional localization towards ‘security experts’ (Bigot 2006), such as the military and police. Methods and instruments associated with these security organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the discourse on ‘what to do’. A good example of securitization was the period leading to the Cold War (Guzzini 2004 ). Originally a political conflict over the organization of societies, in the late 1940s, the East-West confrontation became an existential conflict that was overwhelmingly addressed with military means, including the potential annihilation of humankind. Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout most of the Cold War, secondary to improving military capabilities. Climate change could meet a similar fate.

The double humiliation of protest in the mainstream media, making it both silly and dangerous, subtracts personhood from activists, making their very gestures of citizenship seem proof that their claims arc illegitimate. This is especially germane in the portrayal of pro-life and gay collective actions. In contrast, political suffering is still palatable when expressed as a trauma or injury to a particular person. This narrowing in the means for making a legitimate claim on public sympathy has had a significant effect in a certain strain of U.S. legal theory, where some are arguing that words and images can produce harms to a person as substantial as those made by physical acts of violence, such that violent and cruel talk should be actionable the way physical assault is (Matsuda 1993).  But more than this, talk shows and other forms of gossip media have helped to make scenes of personal witnessing the only political testimony that counts.  It is not that just everybody loves a good sob story.  Trauma makes good storytelling and, as journalistic common sense constantly reminds us, it puts a ""face"" on an otherwise abstract issue.17 Moreover, the sheer scale of the systematically brutal hierarchies that structure national capitalist culture can be overwhelming, leading to a kind of emotional and analytic paralysis [stagnation] in a public that cannot imagine a world without poverty or violence: here too, the facialization of U.S. injustice makes it manageable and enables further deferral of considerations that might force structural transformations of public life.  In the meantime, while the embodied activities of anonymous citizens have taken on the odor of the abject, the personal complaint form now bears a huge burden for vocalizing and embodying injustice in the United States.",summarize the following text: ,"The double humiliation of protest in the mainstream media subtracts personhood from activists In contrast, political suffering is still palatable when expressed as a trauma or injury to a particular person.

"Marijuana’s legalization seems much more like neoliberal privatization of markets than true liberation of them. While I do not question the decency of these first major marijuana retailers, there are legitimate concerns. Those most victimized by the state’s rabid oppression of marijuana markets will find themselves very often out of luck, as extensive background checks are required by law, and any drug felony charge is enough to exclude individuals from operating as vendors. TakePart magazine notes in an article that even as weed is legalized, those in prison for the crime of possessing or selling marijuana will remain there. While new businesses boom with customers, those who formerly tried to compete in this market remain locked up in cages. The drug war has affected millions during its hellish tear through Americans’ lives and culture, but it has always been particularly racialized and classist. This leaves many black, Hispanic and poor individuals with a permanent hex affixed to them that these laws do not address. Like with the beltway libertarian conception of privatization, legalization picks the winners of the weed market from those who were lucky enough to not find themselves on the wrong side of the law and who already have access to the capital to invest into this expensive business. Legalization, at its best, functions as an opposition to continued state violence against drug users and possessors. It is therefore troubling that we find even after this so-called legalization, many remain shackled both by the pre-existing landscape of the market and by new regulations which prohibit them from participating in it. It is never by the political means we realize our freedom, but only a hold-back of even worse oppression. We fight an uphill battle against the incredible damage the state does. And now facing the age of Big Marijuana, we might be shocked to find the sorts of restrictions many established pot shops favor. In order to delegitimize street dealers, we have to treat them as inherently dangerous and volatile.",summarize the following text: ,"Marijuana’s legalization seems much more like neoliberal privatization of markets than true liberation of them the decency of these even as weed is legalized, those in prison for the crime of possessing or selling marijuana will remain there those who formerly tried to compete in this market remain locked up in cages. it has always been particularly racialized and classist.

I argued vigorously with Sagan about the ‘Nuclear Winter’ hypothesis, both in lengthy correspondence and, in August-September 1985, when I was a guest in the lovely house he and Ann Druyan had overlooking Ithaca in up-state New York. I argued that, with more realistic data about the operational characteristics of the respective US and Soviet force configurations (such as bomber delivery profiles, impact footprints of MIRVed warheads) and more plausible exchange scenarios, it was impossible to generate anywhere near the postulated levels of smoke. The megatonnage expended on cities (economic/industrial targets) was more likely to be around 140-650 than over 1,000; the amount of smoke generated would have ranged from around 18 million tonnes to perhaps 80 million tonnes. In the case of counter-force scenarios, most missile forces were (and still are) located in either ploughed fields or tundra and, even where they are generally located in forested or grassed areas, very few of the actual missile silos are less than several kilometres from combustible material. A target-by-target analysis of the actual locations of the strategic nuclear forces in the United States and the Soviet Union showed that the actual amount of smoke produced even by a 4,000 megaton counter-force scenario would range from only 300 tonnes (if the exchange occurred in January) to 2,000 tonnes (for an exchange in July)—the worst case being a factor of 40 smaller than that postulated by the ‘Nuclear Winter’ theorists. I thought that it was just as wrong to overestimate the possible consequences of nuclear war, and to raise the spectre of extermination of human life as a serious likelihood, as to underestimate them (e.g., by omitting fallout casualties).",summarize the following text: ,"Ball ‘6

"Now, the United States, NATO, and the Afghan government itself are gambling that the rest of the country's 344,000 security forces are also ready – or ready enough – to take the lead in defending the entire nation from Taliban forces and Islamist insurgents. As of June 18, NATO turned over to the Afghans the security lead for 100 percent of the country, and US and NATO troops officially shifted to an advise-and-assist role throughout Afghanistan – a role set to draw to a close with the end of NATO's combat mission in December 2014. Evidence is mixed as to the readiness of Afghanistan's Army soldiers and National Police to assume the lead in planning and fighting the war – with the summer combat season likely to be the first big test. There's been progress, to be sure. Most of the Afghan Army brigades – as many as 20 of 26, NATO officials claim – are capable of working on their own, up from one a year ago. And the Afghan people are becoming more confident in the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), polls show. ""The people are getting more confident, and part of that is what they have seen from the ANSF"" in the initial weeks of the summer fighting season, says Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, chairman of the Afghanistan Peace and Reintegration Program. How ready the Afghan forces actually need to be may depend in part on reconciliation talks expected to begin soon between the government of President Hamid Karzai and representatives of the Taliban. Qatar has agreed to host the negotiations, which Mr. Karzai announced June 18 and which US officials described as an ""Afghan-led, Afghan-owned initiative.""

"The United States government is much more bullish about the revenues made by Mexican drug cartels, estimating that Mexican cartels bring home between $15 billion to S30 billion annually from illicit drug sales.“ At one point, the White House Ofﬁce of National Drug Control Policy estimated that more than 60 percent of the cartels’ revenue—$8.6 billion out of $13.8 billion in 2006—came from U.S. marijuana sales. They retracted those estimates in 2010,  but continue to assert that marijuana is the top revenue generator for Mexican drug cartels.“ Just looking at retail value or gross revenue estimates, it's easy to assume cocaine is the most proﬁtable business center in the Mexican cartel’s portfolio. But gross revenues don’t give a ﬁill picture of proﬁtability. A review of costs, market demand and risk is important to assessing which drug brings the most value to the cartels. Marijuana has the largest customer base with the most stable demand and steady prices. Cocaine prices, costs and demand are more volatile. Marijuana is the cheapest drug to cultivate and produce while cocaine goes through an expensive manufacturing process. The cartels pay about $23 to buy a pound of marijuana from a farmer in Mexico. It costs the cartels about $4,000 to buy a pound of cocaine from the Colombians to import to the U.S. Cocaine also has a longer supply chain through more international borders than marijuana, increasing the risks of seizures. While cocaine has a higher retail value than marijuana, the markup for marijuana is higher. For example, a cartel can buy a pound of marijuana for $23 in Mexico and sell it for $550 a pound in Chicago, or 23 times the initial investment. They could buy a pound of cocaine for $4,000 from the Colombians and sell it for $32,000 a pound in Chicago, only eight times the initial investment.

WHY WE SHOULD NOT PAY FOR HUMAN ORGANS         Ebsco
Although class distinctions are an almost naturalized part of social life in all complex societies, in this particular instance the exploitation of organ sellers veers dangerously close to human slavery, as argued by Giovanni Berlinguer (Berlinguer and Garrafa 1996). The pressures put by organ brokers upon the desperation of the world’s dislocated, refugee, and poorest populations to provide the scarce commodities reveals the limits of argu- ments based solely on individual autonomy. Yes, even the poorest people of the world “make choices,” but they do not make these freely or under social or economic conditions of their own making. Further, the pressure of organ brokers upon the poor makes their decision to sell an organ anything but a free and autonomous choice. These secular arguments reach a conclusion similar to one derived from Christian morality—that the sale of human organs is unethical. The most disturbing issue of organ sales to both Christian and secular ethicists is the formation of an economic underclass of organ donors throughout the world to serve the wealthy. This is not to suggest that proponents of organ sales are in favor of exploiting the poor but, rather, that they are indifferent to the social and individual pathologies that markets in kidneys and other body parts produce, such as the documented evidence of postsurgery medical complications, chronic pain, psychological problems, unemployment, decreased earning power, social ostracism, and social stigma faced by kidney sellers in many parts of the world (see Zargooshi 2002; Jimenez and Scheper-Hughes 2002a; Ram 2002).",summarize the following text: ,"the exploitation of organ sellers veers dangerously close to human slavery The pressures put by organ brokers upon the desperation of the world’s dislocated, refugee, and poorest populations to provide the scarce commodities reveals the limits of argu- ments based solely on individual autonomy. the pressure of organ brokers upon the poor makes their decision to sell an organ anything but a free and autonomous choice.

In a truly ironic twist of logic, some opponents of the use of financial incentives for cadaveric organ donors have cited various human rights abuses and extraordinarily high prices associated with such black market activities as har-bingers of the sorts of outcomes likely to accompany legalized organ markets. n32 This line of ""reasoning"" is equivalent to arguing that legalization of liquor sales would lead to the sorts of mafia-related activities that arose during prohibi-tion. This argument stands accepted economic theory on its head. The truth is that the types of behavior and price levels that frequently accompany black market sales tend to disappear when trade is legalized. Legalized trade allows the market price to fall as legitimate businesses enter the market and increase supply. Moreover, costs decrease as the risks of both prosecution and violent actions by rival producers are eliminated. The outcome is lower prices, an increase in the volume of trade, and a cessation of criminal activities. Thus, the types of conduct associated with illegal suppliers involved in black market trade and the prices at which such trade takes place do not accurately reflect the behavior and prices likely to result from legalized sales. In fact, it has long been recognized that the most effective remedy for undesirable black market activity is to eliminate restrictions on trade. Stated succinctly, the cure for black market abuses is legalized trade. That conclusion holds a fortiori, in the case at hand. Eliminating the shortage of cadaveric organs through legalization of financial incentives would greatly reduce, if not eliminate, the demand for living donor kidneys obtained through black markets. Therefore, if one is opposed to current black market activities, then one should favor financial incentives for cadaveric organ donors.",summarize the following text: ,"In a truly ironic twist of logic, some opponents of the use of financial incentives have cited abuses and high prices associated with such black market activities as har-bingers of the sorts of outcomes likely to accompany legalized organ markets This line of ""reasoning"" is equivalent to arguing that legalization of liquor sales would lead to the sorts of mafia-related activities that arose during prohibi-tion.

The language of catastrophe is not the language of science. It will not be visible in next year's global assessment from the world authority of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). To state that climate change will be ""catastrophic"" hides a cascade of value-laden assumptions which do not emerge from empirical or theoretical science. Is any amount of climate change catastrophic? Catastrophic for whom, for where, and by when? What index is being used to measure the catastrophe? The language of fear and terror operates as an ever-weakening vehicle for effective communication or inducement for behavioural change. This has been seen in other areas of public health risk. Empirical work in relation to climate change communication and public perception shows that it operates here too. Framing climate change as an issue which evokes fear and personal stress becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. By ""sexing it up"" we exacerbate, through psychological amplifiers, the very risks we are trying to ward off. The careless (or conspiratorial?) translation of concern about Saddam Hussein's putative military threat into the case for WMD has had major geopolitical repercussions. We need to make sure the agents and agencies in our society which would seek to amplify climate change risks do not lead us down a similar counter-productive pathway. The IPCC scenarios of future climate change - warming somewhere between 1.4 and 5.8 Celsius by 2100 - are significant enough without invoking catastrophe and chaos as unguided weapons with which forlornly to threaten society into behavioural change.

"One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed.¶ “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains.¶ This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy.¶ Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it.¶ There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.”¶ Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks.",summarize the following text: ,"hemp’s decades of illegality have left no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed.  “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin.

"Passing the Corker-Menendez bill might be an easier sell in Congress than imposing additional sanctions, because it is easier to argue that Congress should have “a voice” in the negotiating process. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday night that he wants to fast-track the bill, which might complicate its ability to garner enough Democratic support in time. Menendez has threatened to vote against his own bill, “outraged” at McConnell’s political move. Edward Levine, an advisory board member for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to international peace and security, argues that the bill is more harmful than helpful: Do [Senators] really want to send a message to Tehran that the President may be unable to fulfill his commitments? Do they really want to move the goalposts by adding support for terrorism to the list of reasons for reinstating sanctions? The Corker bill will endanger both the negotiations and the sanctions regime; it does not merit support. AIPAC is also trying to bolster Congress’s role in the negotiations by minimizing the fact that there has always been significant presidential authority built into U.S. sanctions legislation. The authority comes through various mechanisms, such as “waivers,” special rules, and legislative exemptions, which allow a president to decide, often unilaterally, whether and to what degree to lift or implement sanctions. He can make these choices if he believes doing so is in the national security interest of the United States. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, AIPAC’s legions of supporters pressured Congress to impose more sanctions and to reduce the executive branch’s power to lift sanctions. Let’s just hope that the Iranians do not take this as a signal that the negotiators’ commitment to ease sanctions in exchange for good behavior is feeble. Because if the negotiations fail, the war that everyone is trying to avoid is that much more likely.",summarize the following text: ,"Corker-Menendez bill Edward Levine, an advisory board member for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to international peace and security, argues that the bill is more harmful than helpful: send a message to Tehran that the President may be unable to fulfill his commitments move the goalposts by adding support for terrorism to the list of reasons for reinstating sanctions?

"Contrary to Sweden, Germany introduced a more liberal prostitution law in 2002. Today, prostitution in Germany is regulated by law and regarded as a ‘regular job’ subject to tax payment and retirement schemes (Di Nicola et al., 2005). Prior to 2002, Germany only allowed individual, self-employed prostitution without third party involvement. Having a liberal prostitution regime, Germany is known to have one of the largest prostitution markets in Europe, with about 150,000 people working as prostitutes (Global report data used in Danailova-Trainor and Belser, 2006). This means that the number of prostitutes in Germany is 25 more than 60 times that of Sweden, while having a population (82 million inhabitants) less than 10 times larger. In terms of human trafficking victims, the ILO estimated the stock of victims in Germany in 2004 to be approximately 32,800 – about 62 times more than in Sweden (Danailova-Trainor & Belser, 2006). Again, the share of trafficked individuals among all prostitutes appears to be quite similar in both countries, corroborating the view that any compositional differences across prohibitionist and legalized prostitution regimes are likely to be small. Additionally, Di Nicola et al. (2005) provide annual estimates of trafficking victims used for sexual exploitation in Germany over the 1996-2003 period, which can shed some light on the changing number of trafficked prostitutes. The estimates show that the number of victims gradually declined between 1996/97, the first years of data collection, and 2001, when the minimum estimate was 9,870 and the maximum 19,740.37 However, this number increased upon fully legalizing prostitution in 2002, as well as in 2003, rising to 11,080- 22,160 and 12,350-24,700, respectively.38 This is consistent with our result from the quantitative analysis indicating a positive correlation between the legal status of prostitution and inward trafficking.",summarize the following text: ,"prostitution in Germany is regulated by law the number of prostitutes in Germany is 25 more than 60 times that of Sweden .

"Some critics of modern medicine and its orientation toward extending life beyond ""natural"" limits, such as Nancy Scheper-Hughcs (2004), regard the entire idea of an organ shortage as a contrivance of modern medical practice. It is not the purpose of this work to address such claims. For our purposes, a shortage exists if there is an increase in the waiting list, appropriately adjusted for deaths, sickness, and the like. Thus, by necessity, we will ignore most speculation concerning the numbers of persons who, on strictly medical grounds of some sort, might benefit from a transplant. This latter number will always exceed the active waiting lists, perhaps by a large margin. Some opponents of market-based reforms in organ procurement have claimed that any increase in available organs will only trigger a flood of additional registrations, as physicians begin listing their patients under weaker and weaker criteria.Yet, even if abundant numbers of good organs were available for free, transplantation would remain an expensive procedure in absolute terms, so it will likely never be the case that transplants will be generally done on very thin grounds. In most or all industrialized countries, the general consensus is that those on waiting lists are, in virtually all cases, persons who would, in fact, benefit from a transplant in a meaningful and substantial way.
Thus, it seems quite fair to say that a global organ shortage does indeed exist. Although our conceptualization of this shortage means that we will pay too much attention to economically advanced countries, it must be empha¬sized that many middle- and lower-income nations would have shortages, as we define them, had they the resources.That is, on reasonable medical grounds, transplantation is the best therapy, and sometimes the only good therapy, for a variety of serious conditions, and these conditions are, unfortunately, prevalent throughout much of the world.

"The House of Representatives gave a thumbs-up Wednesday to allowing the marijuana industry into the banking system. The legislation, which passed by a 231-192 margin, would prohibit the use of federal funds to penalize banks and credit unions for providing financial services to state-licensed pot businesses. It is unclear if the measure will make a difference for banks and credit unions that are weighing the risks involved with serving the pot business. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, but numerous states have legalized its medicinal or recreational use, and that conflict puts banks in a difficult position. Still, the House vote marks another step in the direction of bringing marijuana enterprises into the financial mainstream. In February, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network released guidance for banks interested in serving the pot industry. The House measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 45 Republicans, and was hailed by the marijuana industry as a landmark. ""This is a huge step forward for the legal cannabis industry,"" Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, said in a news release. The legislation, which was introduced as an amendment to a financial services appropriations bill, has yet to pass in the Senate. The House version was sponsored by Democratic Reps. Denny Heck, Ed Perlmutter and Barbara Lee and GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. A competing amendment, which would have blocked the implementation of the Fincen guidance on marijuana, was defeated by a 236-186 margin. Since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, a coalition that includes the pot industry, elected officials, and law enforcement agencies in those states have been calling for marijuana businesses to be brought into the banking system. They argue that as long as pot enterprises operate as cash-only businesses, they are susceptible to threats such as armed robbery and money laundering.",summarize the following text: ,"The House gave a thumbs-up to allowing the marijuana industry into the banking system The legislation, which passed by a 231-192 margin, would prohibit the use of federal funds to penalize banks and credit unions for providing financial services to state-licensed pot businesses. the House vote marks another step in the direction of bringing marijuana enterprises into the financial mainstream The House measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 45 Republicans and was hailed by the marijuana industry as a landmark This is a huge step forward for the legal cannabis industry The legislation has yet to pass in the Senate Since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, a coalition that includes the pot industry, elected officials, and law enforcement agencies in those states have been calling for marijuana businesses to be brought into the banking system"
"This Note argues that federal law should be amended so as to allow the already-existing registry of patients in need of organ transplants to bring together the families and friends of different patients on the waiting list in order to save lives. There are many people who, although willing to donate a nonvital organ to save the life of a loved one in need of a transplant, are unable to do so due to biological incompatibility.18 A system of paired organ exchanges would facilitate transplantation in situations where a friend or family member of Patient A is incompatible with him, but would be compatible with some other person on the waiting list (Patient B), and a close friend or family member of Patient B is incompatible with her, but compatible with Patient A. The family member of patient A would donate a compatible nonvital organ to patient B, on the condition that the family member of patient B donates a compatible nonvital organ to patient A; hence the phrase ""paired organ exchange."" While potential enforcement issues can be avoided by conducting the transplants at the same time and, if possible, in the same hospital, this is not essential to my proposal. I contend that paired organ exchanges should not only be permitted under federal law, but also facilitated, by expanding the existing national database of patients in need of organs to include information about individuals potentially willing to donate on behalf of each patient, and using this data to identify cross-matches. By permitting and facilitating paired organ exchanges, the government could bring together compatible donors and recipients who would otherwise never meet, and in each successful case allow two transplants to occur that might otherwise be impossible. This system would, of course, be limited to the exchange of nonvital or regenerable organs (kidneys and livers), where donation would not endanger the donor or adversely impact the donor's major life activities.",summarize the following text: ,"federal law should be amended so as to allow the already-existing registry of patients in need of organ transplants to bring together different patients on the waiting list in order to save lives A system of paired organ exchanges would facilitate transplantation in situations where a friend or family member of Patient A is incompatible with him, but would be compatible with some other person on the waiting list (Patient B), and a close friend or family member of Patient B is incompatible with her, but compatible with Patient A.

"Short-term Effects on Mexican DTOs and Security Implications  Mexican DTOs would likely branch into other avenues of crime. Perhaps the most obvious short-term effect of marijuana legalization is that this would rob the Sinaloa and Tijuana cartels of up to half of their total revenue.117 The economic strain placed on the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel may not necessarily help Mexico in the short term. The short-term effects of legalization could very well create chaos for Mexico. “The cartels compensate for their loss of drug revenue by branching out into other criminal activities--kidnapping, murder-for-hire, contraband, illegal 29 immigrant smuggling, extortion, theft of oil and other items, loan-sharking, prostitution, selling protection, etc.”118 This means that if the social and economic environment remains the same then “they are not going to return to the licit world.”119 If the Sinaloa cartel and the Tijuana cartel turn towards activities like kidnapping, human trafficking and extortion, it could lead to a spike in violence that would prove to be destabilizing in those organizations‟ areas of operation.  The Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel might splinter into smaller groups. In addition, the loss of more than 40% of revenue would probably force them to downsize their operations. Like any large business going through downsizing, employees will likely be shed first in order to maintain profitability.120 These former DTO operatives will likely not return to earning a legitimate income, but rather will independently find new revenue sources in a manner similar to their employers. Therefore it is possible that the legalization of marijuana in the United States could cause territories currently under the control of the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel to become more violent than they are today. This is troubling, as Sinaloa, Baja California, Sonora, and Chihuahua states are already among the most violent areas of Mexico.121",summarize the following text: ,"Mexican DTOs would likely branch into other avenues of crime. the most obvious short-term effect of marijuana legalization is that this would rob the Sinaloa and Tijuana cartels of up to half of their total revenue.

"One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction.29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'.30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up. Complex statistical analysis is unnecessary to reach the conclusion that world peace and US military expenditure are unrelated.",summarize the following text: ,"evidence suggests there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and no relation between American activism and international stability. the verdict from the 90s world grew more peaceful while the U S cut its forces.

"On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)  When something is about as probable as a thousand fair dice when tossed a thousand times coming up all sixes, then, so it is held, we can pretty well forget about it as a worthy of concern.  As a matter of practical policy, we operate with probabilities on the principle that when x ≤ E, then x = 0.  We take the line that in our human dealings in real-life situations a sufficiently remote possibility can—for all sensible purposes—be viewed as being of probability zero.  Accordingly, such remote possibilities can simply be dismissed, and the outcomes with which they are associated can accordingly be set aside.  And in “the real world” people do in fact seem to be prepared to treat certain probabilities as effectively zero, taking certain sufficiently improbable eventualities as no long representing real possibilities.  Here an extremely improbable event is seen as something we can simply write off as being outside the range of appropriate concern, something we can dismiss for all practical purposes.  As one writer on insurance puts it: [P]eople…refuse to worry about losses whose probability is below some threshold.  Probabilities below the threshold are treated as though they were zero.  No doubt, remote-possibility events having such a minute possibility can happen in some sense of the term, but this “can” functions somewhat figuratively—it is no longer seen as something that presents a realistic prospect.",summarize the following text: ,"small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off we can forget about it as a worthy of concern.

"International Law. Another complication for legalization is international law. While many researchers attempt to make international comparisons in studying drugs, one area of drug control policy that receives scant attention is the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 which binds all UN member nations to maintain prohibition of drugs, including cannabis specifically (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 61). While the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires that countries maintain prohibition of manufacture, sales, and import, it does not require a punitive regime of the type currently found in the United States. Article 36 of the Single Convention, “Penal Provision,” specifically allows for treatment programs to either enhance or serve as a substitute for punishment.81 The Economist reports that countries like the Netherlands are able to allow for some innovation in controlling marijuana use through the convention’s commentary, which states that its goal is “improvement of the efficacy of national criminal justice systems in the field of drug trafficking” (“A Toker’s Guide” 2009). Thus, reforms working within the framework of the existing treaty are possible, though full- scale legalization would require either a country’s withdrawal from the treaty or revision thereof. Perhaps partly due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, even countries with more liberal narcotics policies than the United States lack full- fledged drug legalization and at most allow for depenalization of marijuana and/ or widespread needle exchange programs. As discussed above, in the Netherlands, a country long known for its tolerance of marijuana smoking, the importation and commercial production of cannabis remains illegal (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 64). When considering its own drug reform, Portugal declined to adopt outright legalization likely in part because of its treaty obligations under the 1961 Single Convention (Cato Institute 2009).",summarize the following text: ,"Another complication for legalization is international law the Single Convention binds all UN member nations to maintain prohibition of drugs, including cannabis specifically While the Single Convention requires that countries maintain prohibition it does not require a punitive regime reforms working within the framework of the existing treaty are possible, though full- scale legalization would require either a country’s withdrawal  or revision due to the Single Convention even countries with more liberal narcotics policies lack full- fledged drug legalization in the Netherlands the importation and commercial production of cannabis remains illegal"
"People are awful at killing themselves. You would think that once you set your mind to self-destruction, it would be fairly straightforward—but the majority of people fail.

"Since existing federal laws do not explicitly make Internet gambling illegal for individuals242 and Congress appears to be concerned about the social harms of gambling on individual citizens,243 the most obvious solution to curb Internet gambling would be for Congress to enact legislation that explicitly makes Internet gambling illegal for individuals.244 Although enforcement efforts could be difficult due to the nature of e-commerce, federal officials have developed methods for enforcing child pornography laws and other laws that ban illegal activities on the Internet.245 Putting the general public on notice that Internet gambling is illegal and also making a visible enforcement effort could have a dramatic impact on this issue.246 Similar to the traffic laws, a limited enforcement and the threat of penalties are sufficient to discourage many people from breaking the laws.247 Under this approach, Congress could either repeal the UIGEA or leave it in place. If the UIGEA is repealed, the government, not financial institutions, would assume responsibility for enforcement of the anti-gambling laws.248 If the UIGEA remains, financial institutions would have a clear determination from Congress as to what constitutes illegal Internet gambling.249 As it stands, financial institutions are forced to make this determination on their own accord.250 Thus, whether the UIGEA is repealed or remains in effect, a law explicitly prohibiting all Internet gambling would permit financial institutions to focus more of their resources on their own business activities and cease spending their private funds on law enforcement and law interpretation.251 In this way, a law explicitly prohibiting Internet gambling and amending or repealing the UIGEA would greatly reduce the impending burden that the UIGEA, in its present state, creates for financial institutions.252 Furthermore, express prohibition would likely be more effective in curbing Internet gambling than the UIGEA.253",summarize the following text: ,"Since existing federal laws do not explicitly make Internet gambling illegal and Congress appears to be concerned about social harms the most obvious solution would be for Congress to enact legislation that explicitly makes Internet gambling illegal Although enforcement efforts could be difficult federal officials have developed methods for enforcing laws that ban illegal activities on the Internet Putting the general public on notice that Internet gambling is illegal and also making a visible enforcement effort could have a dramatic impact on this issue limited enforcement and the threat of penalties are sufficient to discourage many people from breaking the laws If the UIGEA is repealed, the government, not financial institutions, would assume responsibility for enforcement of the anti-gambling laws As it stands, financial institutions are forced to make this determination on their own accord a law explicitly prohibiting all Internet gambling would permit financial institutions to focus more of their resources on their own business activities and cease spending their private funds on law enforcement and law interpretation , a law explicitly prohibiting Internet gambling and repealing the UIGEA would greatly reduce the impending burden that the UIGEA creates for financial institutions express prohibition would likely be more effective in curbing Internet gambling than the UIGEA.253"

"The heart of the debate about climate change comes from numerous warnings from scientists and others that give the impression that human- induced climate change is an immediate threat to society (IPCC 2007a, 2007c; Stern 2006). Millions of people might be vulnerable to health effects (IPCC 2007a), crop production might fall in the low latitudes (IPCC 2007a), water supplies might dwindle (IPCC 2007a), precipitation might fall in arid regions (IPCC 2007a), extreme events will grow exponentially (Stern 2006), and between 20 and 30 percent of species will risk extinction (IPCC 2007a). Even worse, there may be catastrophic events such as the melting of Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, causing severe sea-level rise, which would inundate hundreds of millions of people (Dasgupta and others 2009). Proponents argue that there is no time to waste. Unless greenhouse gases are cut dramatically today, economic growth and well-being may be at risk (Stern 2006). These statements are largely alarmist and misleading. Although climate change is a serious problem that deserves attention, society’s immediate behavior has an extremely low probability of leading to catastrophic conse- quences. The science and economics of climate change are quite clear that emissions over the next few decades will lead to only mild consequences. The severe impacts predicted by alarmists require a century (or two, accord- ing to Stern 2006) of no mitigation. Many of the predicted impacts assume that there will be no or little adaptation. The net economic impacts from climate change over the next 50 years will be small regardless. Most of the more severe impacts will take more than a century or even a millennium to unfold, and many of these “potential” impacts will never occur because people will adapt. It is not at all apparent that immediate and dramatic policies need to be developed to thwart long-range climate risks.

"Democrats Charles Schumer (N.Y.) and Robert Menendez (N.J.) have joined Republican Mark Kirk (Ill.) in placing a ticking bomb under President Obama’s Christmas tree. The bomb is an AIPAC-sponsored bill that commits the United States to stop Iran from enriching any uranium at all, and also requires the United States to “stand with Israel” in the event Netanyahu decides, for reasons of “self-defense,” to start a war with Iran. The purpose of the bill is transparent: to scuttle the P5+1 (U.S., Britain, France, Germany, Russia, and China) diplomacy with Tehran, because it is well known to everyone concerned that Iran is not going to abandon completely a nuclear energy program underway since the Shah was in power. Gary Sick, the Columbia University Iran expert, has posted on his website an open letter to Schumer, noting that the bill seeks to “remove any negotiating authority from the U.S. government by specifying in advance the terms of an impossible settlement.” Further, Sick observes, the bill “outsources any decision about resort to military action to the government of Israel, by committing the United States in advance to support any military action by Israel.” These are the two central points. Netanyahu wants war with Iran, but he doesn’t want to fight it by himself. Schumer, Menendez, and Kirk hope to compel the United States to step in and finish the job after Israel throws the first punch. But even if such a war were just (which it isn’t), or even if we had allies besides Israel (which we wouldn’t), the aftermath of such a war ends most likely (as the former hawk Kenneth Pollack argues in his exhaustive analysis “Unthinkable“) with an American occupation of Iran. At a cost in blood and treasure many times the invasion of Iraq. There is no realistic scenario under which Iran’s government is going abandon entirely its nuclear program. Schumer, Kirk, and Menendez know this perfectly well. Their resolution is a backdoor to war.

"Passing the Corker-Menendez bill might be an easier sell in Congress than imposing additional sanctions, because it is easier to argue that Congress should have “a voice” in the negotiating process. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Tuesday night that he wants to fast-track the bill, which might complicate its ability to garner enough Democratic support in time. Menendez has threatened to vote against his own bill, “outraged” at McConnell’s political move. Edward Levine, an advisory board member for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to international peace and security, argues that the bill is more harmful than helpful: Do [Senators] really want to send a message to Tehran that the President may be unable to fulfill his commitments? Do they really want to move the goalposts by adding support for terrorism to the list of reasons for reinstating sanctions? The Corker bill will endanger both the negotiations and the sanctions regime; it does not merit support. AIPAC is also trying to bolster Congress’s role in the negotiations by minimizing the fact that there has always been significant presidential authority built into U.S. sanctions legislation. The authority comes through various mechanisms, such as “waivers,” special rules, and legislative exemptions, which allow a president to decide, often unilaterally, whether and to what degree to lift or implement sanctions. He can make these choices if he believes doing so is in the national security interest of the United States. On Capitol Hill on Tuesday, AIPAC’s legions of supporters pressured Congress to impose more sanctions and to reduce the executive branch’s power to lift sanctions. Let’s just hope that the Iranians do not take this as a signal that the negotiators’ commitment to ease sanctions in exchange for good behavior is feeble. Because if the negotiations fail, the war that everyone is trying to avoid is that much more likely.",summarize the following text: ,"Corker-Menendez bill Edward Levine, an advisory board member for the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, a nonprofit research organization dedicated to international peace and security, argues that the bill is more harmful than helpful: send a message to Tehran that the President may be unable to fulfill his commitments move the goalposts by adding support for terrorism to the list of reasons for reinstating sanctions?

"The House of Representatives gave a thumbs-up Wednesday to allowing the marijuana industry into the banking system. The legislation, which passed by a 231-192 margin, would prohibit the use of federal funds to penalize banks and credit unions for providing financial services to state-licensed pot businesses. It is unclear if the measure will make a difference for banks and credit unions that are weighing the risks involved with serving the pot business. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, but numerous states have legalized its medicinal or recreational use, and that conflict puts banks in a difficult position. Still, the House vote marks another step in the direction of bringing marijuana enterprises into the financial mainstream. In February, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network released guidance for banks interested in serving the pot industry. The House measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 45 Republicans, and was hailed by the marijuana industry as a landmark. ""This is a huge step forward for the legal cannabis industry,"" Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, said in a news release. The legislation, which was introduced as an amendment to a financial services appropriations bill, has yet to pass in the Senate. The House version was sponsored by Democratic Reps. Denny Heck, Ed Perlmutter and Barbara Lee and GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. A competing amendment, which would have blocked the implementation of the Fincen guidance on marijuana, was defeated by a 236-186 margin. Since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, a coalition that includes the pot industry, elected officials, and law enforcement agencies in those states have been calling for marijuana businesses to be brought into the banking system. They argue that as long as pot enterprises operate as cash-only businesses, they are susceptible to threats such as armed robbery and money laundering.",summarize the following text: ,"The House gave a thumbs-up to allowing the marijuana industry into the banking system The legislation, which passed by a 231-192 margin, would prohibit the use of federal funds to penalize banks and credit unions for providing financial services to state-licensed pot businesses. the House vote marks another step in the direction of bringing marijuana enterprises into the financial mainstream The House measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 45 Republicans and was hailed by the marijuana industry as a landmark This is a huge step forward for the legal cannabis industry The legislation has yet to pass in the Senate Since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, a coalition that includes the pot industry, elected officials, and law enforcement agencies in those states have been calling for marijuana businesses to be brought into the banking system"

"Any white paper that includes a policy review of drug legislation must include key term definitions that are clear, accurate, and coherent. Thus, there are various definitions of „legalization‟ of marijuana use and commerce strewn across countless reports, papers and analyses of drug policy. It is critical to note that legalization and decriminalization are terms for very different proposals even though they are sometimes conflated. Decriminalization proposes the removal of the criminal penalty for possession of marijuana, but not for its trafficking and production. „Legalization‟ authorizes the possession, production and trafficking of marijuana, and therefore enables the state to tax and regulate its sale and consumption.4 This study takes a holistic approach to examining how legalization of marijuana in the United States would affect Mexican DTOs. However, in the United States there has been no example of true marijuana legalization since the inception of the modern drug control regime. This is why our case studies will look at changes that occurred after various countries relaxed their system of marijuana prohibition. We will look at decriminalization in Mexico and Portugal, as well as a special case of toleration/de facto legalization in the Netherlands. However, we will first lay out in detail what each type of change entails. Decriminalization is one of the most common methods employed by countries that seek to ease or lighten anti-marijuana policies. A common definition of decriminalization is “the removal of the criminal sanction for possession,” in effect making the penalty for the possession of marijuana a civil (fines, counseling etc), rather than criminal offense. 5 One common example of this type of reform is the 2001 Law 30/2000 in Portugal. What is important here is that criminal penalties for possession are removed, but there is still some type of civil sanction in place that punishes both users and producers. This is what separates decriminalization from legalization.",summarize the following text: ,"legalization and decriminalization are terms for very different proposals even though they are sometimes conflated Decriminalization proposes the removal of the criminal penalty for possession of marijuana, but not for its trafficking and production „Legalization‟ authorizes the possession, production and trafficking of marijuana, and therefore enables the state to tax and regulate its sale and consumption A common definition of decriminalization is “the removal of the criminal sanction for possession,” in effect making the penalty for the possession of marijuana a civil rather than criminal offense What is important here is that criminal penalties for possession are removed, but there is still some type of civil sanction in place that punishes both users and producers.

"Globally, legislation guiding organ donation and transplant varies widely.1 Only 20% of African nations report having a transplant and organ donation coordinating structure, while 95% of countries in the Americas have such a system in place. Even fewer countries have a mechanism for collection and analysis of data related to donation, donor safety, and transplantation activities. Some countries report that liver and/or kidney transplants are performed despite a lack of legislation. Such lack of oversight may promulgate illegal transplantation and organ trafficking. Even in countries that have legislation regulating organ trafficking, there is weak enforcement and few international regulations that can effectively police the problem.43 A recent report by Global Financial Integrity estimates that the illicit organ trade generates illegal profits between $600 million and $1.2 billion per year.44 It is hypothesized that this market is fueled not only by profit but also by cultural and religious barriers to organ donation and transplantation in some countries, long waiting lists for organs, precarious infrastructure for transplants in the country of origin, and difficult access to chronic life support (in the case of renal replacement therapy).45 A growing number of countries report that patients have allegedly traveled to countries to buy organs on the black (illicit) market, a practice known as transplant tourism. The World Health Organization estimates that 5% to 10% of kidney transplants worldwide occur as a result of commercial transactions.46,47 A study of American citizens who received organ transplants abroad showed that roughly 90% were kidney transplants and that male sex, Asian race, resident and nonresident alien status, and college education were significantly and independently associated with foreign transplant.48 In 2006, patients from 34 states, plus the District of Columbia, received foreign transplants in 35 countries, led by China, the Philippines, and India.48",summarize the following text: ,"Globally, legislation guiding organ transplant varies widely.

"Yet despite all these potential crucibles of conflict, the Asia-Pacific, if  not an area of serenity and calm, is certainly more stable than one might  expect. To be sure, there are separatist movements and internal struggles,  particularly with insurgencies, as in Thailand, the Philippines and Tibet.  Since the resolution of the East Timor crisis, however, the region has been  relatively free of open armed warfare. Separatism remains a challenge, but  the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance, but its impact is  contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at  least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearisation of the  peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict any time soon, espe- cially given recent Kuomintang Party victories in Taiwan and efforts by  Taiwan and China to re-open informal channels of consultation as well as  institutional relationships between organisations responsible for cross-strait  relations. And while in Asia there is no strong supranational political entity  like the European Union, there are many multilateral organisations and  international initiatives dedicated to enhancing peace and stability, includ- ing the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Proliferation  Security Initiative and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. In Southeast  Asia, countries are united in a common geopolitical and economic organi- sation – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – which is  dedicated to peaceful economic, social and cultural development, and to the  promotion of regional peace and stability.

"On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)  When something is about as probable as a thousand fair dice when tossed a thousand times coming up all sixes, then, so it is held, we can pretty well forget about it as a worthy of concern.  As a matter of practical policy, we operate with probabilities on the principle that when x ≤ E, then x = 0.  We take the line that in our human dealings in real-life situations a sufficiently remote possibility can—for all sensible purposes—be viewed as being of probability zero.  Accordingly, such remote possibilities can simply be dismissed, and the outcomes with which they are associated can accordingly be set aside.  And in “the real world” people do in fact seem to be prepared to treat certain probabilities as effectively zero, taking certain sufficiently improbable eventualities as no long representing real possibilities.  Here an extremely improbable event is seen as something we can simply write off as being outside the range of appropriate concern, something we can dismiss for all practical purposes.

"One potential explanation for the growth of global peace can be dismissed fairly quickly: US actions do not seem to have contributed much. The limited evidence suggests that there is little reason to believe in the stabilising power of the US hegemon, and that there is no relation between the relative level of American activism and international stability. During the 1990s, the United States cut back on its defence spending fairly substantially. By 1998, the United States was spending $100 billion less on defence in real terms than it had in 1990, a 25% reduction.29 To internationalists, defence hawks and other believers in hegemonic stability, this irresponsible 'peace dividend' endangered both national and global security. 'No serious analyst of American military capabilities', argued neo-conservatives William Kristol and Robert Kagan in 1996, 'doubts that the defense budget has been cut much too far to meet America's responsibilities to itself and to world peace'.30 And yet the verdict from the 1990s is fairly plain: the world grew more peaceful while the United States cut its forces. No state seemed to believe that its security was endangered by a less-capable US military, or at least none took any action that would suggest such a belief. No militaries were enhanced to address power vacuums; no security dilemmas drove insecurity or arms races; no regional balancing occurred once the stabilis-ing presence of the US military was diminished. The rest of the world acted as if the threat of international war was not a pressing concern, despite the reduction in US military capabilities. Most of all, the United States was no less safe. The incidence and magnitude of global conflict declined while the United States cut its military spending under President Bill Clinton, and kept declining as the George W. Bush administration ramped the spending back up.

Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute who received a kidney from a friend in 2006, says: ""Despite decades and decades of public education about the virtues of organ donation, the waiting list just gets longer, and the time to transplantation just gets longer. ... It's past time to face the fact that altruism is just not enough. Many people need more of an incentive to give. And that's why we need to be able to compensate people who are willing to give a kidney to a stranger, to save a life. ... We are not talking about a classic commercial free-for-all, or a free market, or an eBay system. We're talking about a third-party payer. For example, today you could decide to give a kidney. You'd be called a Good Samaritan donor. ... The only difference in a model that I'm thinking about is where you go and give your organ, and your retirement account is wired $40,000, end of story.""

WHY WE SHOULD NOT PAY FOR HUMAN ORGANS         Ebsco
Although class distinctions are an almost naturalized part of social life in all complex societies, in this particular instance the exploitation of organ sellers veers dangerously close to human slavery, as argued by Giovanni Berlinguer (Berlinguer and Garrafa 1996). The pressures put by organ brokers upon the desperation of the world’s dislocated, refugee, and poorest populations to provide the scarce commodities reveals the limits of argu- ments based solely on individual autonomy. Yes, even the poorest people of the world “make choices,” but they do not make these freely or under social or economic conditions of their own making. Further, the pressure of organ brokers upon the poor makes their decision to sell an organ anything but a free and autonomous choice. These secular arguments reach a conclusion similar to one derived from Christian morality—that the sale of human organs is unethical. The most disturbing issue of organ sales to both Christian and secular ethicists is the formation of an economic underclass of organ donors throughout the world to serve the wealthy. This is not to suggest that proponents of organ sales are in favor of exploiting the poor but, rather, that they are indifferent to the social and individual pathologies that markets in kidneys and other body parts produce, such as the documented evidence of postsurgery medical complications, chronic pain, psychological problems, unemployment, decreased earning power, social ostracism, and social stigma faced by kidney sellers in many parts of the world (see Zargooshi 2002; Jimenez and Scheper-Hughes 2002a; Ram 2002).",summarize the following text: ,"the exploitation of organ sellers veers dangerously close to human slavery The pressures put by organ brokers upon the desperation of the world’s dislocated, refugee, and poorest populations to provide the scarce commodities reveals the limits of argu- ments based solely on individual autonomy. the pressure of organ brokers upon the poor makes their decision to sell an organ anything but a free and autonomous choice.

"The recent Canadian court decision helps establish social justice for sex workers in Canada. The court ruled against laws that put prostitutes at risk by preventing them from working indoors, screening clients or hiring bodyguards. The decision also clarifies pimping laws so sex workers can enter business relationships, rent apartments, etc. An upcoming Canadian case challenges communication laws that endanger street workers. The United States should follow Canada's lead. Now, when a sex worker is raped, she or he is unlikely to go to the police, fearing arrest. Rapists are well aware of that vulnerability, even claiming to target sex workers because they know we have no recourse. Exploitation and danger are exacerbated when sex work is criminalized. Studies consistently show a reduction in violence when sex work is legal. Of course, decriminalization is not the answer to all the problems. It’s only a starting place, so that sex workers can begin to protect themselves, organize and advocate. In New Zealand, commercial sex is regulated not by criminal law, but by civil codes, business regulations and the range of fair labor protections. Prostitution prohibition campaigns often associate legal prostitution with increased trafficking. But academics, journalists and activists have debunked these claims as manipulative, inaccurate and unscientific. Contemporary prohibitionists prescribe the “Swedish model,” which criminalizes clients of sex workers. Although such laws are promoted as a solution to violence against prostitutes in Sweden, well-documented and independent studies have shown that these laws expose them to greater danger as they drive sex workers underground. Contrary to popular stereotypes, sex workers are valuable members of our communities who contribute a great deal to their families, and to the economy of their countries. Accepting this would create a practical and fair approach to sex worker safety, and let us reject antique moralism that protected women from sex itself and used public order laws to control the poor.",summarize the following text: ,"The recent Canadian court decision helps establish social justice for sex workers in Canada.

"The heart of the debate about climate change comes from numerous warnings from scientists and others that give the impression that human- induced climate change is an immediate threat to society (IPCC 2007a, 2007c; Stern 2006). Millions of people might be vulnerable to health effects (IPCC 2007a), crop production might fall in the low latitudes (IPCC 2007a), water supplies might dwindle (IPCC 2007a), precipitation might fall in arid regions (IPCC 2007a), extreme events will grow exponentially (Stern 2006), and between 20 and 30 percent of species will risk extinction (IPCC 2007a). Even worse, there may be catastrophic events such as the melting of Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, causing severe sea-level rise, which would inundate hundreds of millions of people (Dasgupta and others 2009). Proponents argue that there is no time to waste. Unless greenhouse gases are cut dramatically today, economic growth and well-being may be at risk (Stern 2006). These statements are largely alarmist and misleading. Although climate change is a serious problem that deserves attention, society’s immediate behavior has an extremely low probability of leading to catastrophic conse- quences. The science and economics of climate change are quite clear that emissions over the next few decades will lead to only mild consequences. The severe impacts predicted by alarmists require a century (or two, accord- ing to Stern 2006) of no mitigation. Many of the predicted impacts assume that there will be no or little adaptation. The net economic impacts from climate change over the next 50 years will be small regardless. Most of the more severe impacts will take more than a century or even a millennium to unfold, and many of these “potential” impacts will never occur because people will adapt. It is not at all apparent that immediate and dramatic policies need to be developed to thwart long-range climate risks. What is needed are long-run balanced responses.",summarize the following text: ,Proponents argue that there is no time to waste ).

"I want to mention two further points. (1) Singer and other euthanasia advocates often miss the fact that “quality of life” is not a simple property inherent in individuals. It is rather a relational property describing how we as a society care for one another, especially the most vulnerable among us. The low quality of life ascribed to many people with differences is less a result of clinical medical facts than of social attitudes and policies towards those people.69 In particular, until every seriously ill or disabled person has a right to the health care and support services necessary to provide a good quality of life, talk about their “right to die” is dangerous, discriminatory, and unjust.70 (2) When phy- sicians kill, it causes confusion as to their appropriate role as healers. In 1993, the Protestant Christian Elderly Soci- ety in Holland surveyed several thousand elders on health care issues. The survey did not mention euthanasia. Nev- ertheless, 10% of the respondents said that they were afraid that they would be killed without their consent. The Society’s Direaor Hans Holmans said, “They are afraid that at a certain moment, on the basis of age, a treatment will be considered no longer economically viable, and an early end to their lives will be made.”7' Such distrust under- mines die capacity of physicians to serve their healing role. Considerations like these suggest that prudence and a sense of history should keep us from hastening toward what might seem like an abstractly reasonable social policy. Slip- pery slope arguments may not establish a conncction of logical necessity between their premises and conclusions, but they are not for that reason fallacious. The lessons of history are real lessons. Abstract reasoning is too frail a reed to support ignoring them. The burden of proof that euthanasia is permissible on a limited basis lies with its ad- vocates. It is a burden, I contend, that has not yet been met.",summarize the following text: ,"quality of life” is not a simple property i It is rather a relational property describing how we as a society care for one another, especially the most vulnerable The low quality of life ascribed to many people with differences is less a result of clinical medical facts than of social attitudes until every seriously ill or disabled person has a right to the health care and support services necessary to provide a good quality of life, talk about their “right to die” is dangerous, discriminatory, and unjust.

"On this issue there is a systemic disagreement between probabilists working on theory-oriented issues in mathematics or natural science and decision theorists who work on practical decision-oriented issues relating to human affairs.  The former takes the line that small number are small numbers and must be taken into account as such—that is, the small quantities they actually are.  The latter tend to take the view that small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off.  (De minimis non curat lex, as the old precept has it: in human affairs there is no need to bother with trifles.)  When something is about as probable as a thousand fair dice when tossed a thousand times coming up all sixes, then, so it is held, we can pretty well forget about it as a worthy of concern.  As a matter of practical policy, we operate with probabilities on the principle that when x ≤ E, then x = 0.  We take the line that in our human dealings in real-life situations a sufficiently remote possibility can—for all sensible purposes—be viewed as being of probability zero.  Accordingly, such remote possibilities can simply be dismissed, and the outcomes with which they are associated can accordingly be set aside.  And in “the real world” people do in fact seem to be prepared to treat certain probabilities as effectively zero, taking certain sufficiently improbable eventualities as no long representing real possibilities.  Here an extremely improbable event is seen as something we can simply write off as being outside the range of appropriate concern, something we can dismiss for all practical purposes.  As one writer on insurance puts it: [P]eople…refuse to worry about losses whose probability is below some threshold.  Probabilities below the threshold are treated as though they were zero.  No doubt, remote-possibility events having such a minute possibility can happen in some sense of the term, but this “can” functions somewhat figuratively—it is no longer seen as something that presents a realistic prospect.",summarize the following text: ,"small probabilities represent extremely remote prospect and can be written off we can forget about it as a worthy of concern.

"Globally, legislation guiding organ donation and transplant varies widely.1 Only 20% of African nations report having a transplant and organ donation coordinating structure, while 95% of countries in the Americas have such a system in place. Even fewer countries have a mechanism for collection and analysis of data related to donation, donor safety, and transplantation activities. Some countries report that liver and/or kidney transplants are performed despite a lack of legislation. Such lack of oversight may promulgate illegal transplantation and organ trafficking. Even in countries that have legislation regulating organ trafficking, there is weak enforcement and few international regulations that can effectively police the problem.43 A recent report by Global Financial Integrity estimates that the illicit organ trade generates illegal profits between $600 million and $1.2 billion per year.44 It is hypothesized that this market is fueled not only by profit but also by cultural and religious barriers to organ donation and transplantation in some countries, long waiting lists for organs, precarious infrastructure for transplants in the country of origin, and difficult access to chronic life support (in the case of renal replacement therapy).45 A growing number of countries report that patients have allegedly traveled to countries to buy organs on the black (illicit) market, a practice known as transplant tourism. The World Health Organization estimates that 5% to 10% of kidney transplants worldwide occur as a result of commercial transactions.46,47 A study of American citizens who received organ transplants abroad showed that roughly 90% were kidney transplants and that male sex, Asian race, resident and nonresident alien status, and college education were significantly and independently associated with foreign transplant.48 In 2006, patients from 34 states, plus the District of Columbia, received foreign transplants in 35 countries, led by China, the Philippines, and India.48",summarize the following text: ,"Globally, legislation guiding organ transplant varies widely.

"Strategic stability in the region is thus undermined by various factors: (1) asymmetric interests in the bargaining framework that can introduce unpredictable behavior from actors; (2) the presence of non-state actors that introduce unpredictability into relationships between the antagonists; (3) incompatible assumptions about the structure of the deterrent relationship that makes the bargaining framework strategically unstable; (4) perceptions by Israel and the United States that its window of opportunity for military action is closing, which could prompt a preventive attack; (5) the prospect that Iran’s response to pre-emptive attacks could involve unconventional weapons, which could prompt escalation by Israel and/or the United States; (6) the lack of a communications framework to build trust and cooperation among framework participants. These systemic weaknesses in the coercive bargaining framework all suggest that escalation by any the parties could happen either on purpose or as a result of miscalculation or the pressures of wartime circumstance. Given these factors, it is disturbingly easy to imagine scenarios under which a conflict could quickly escalate in which the regional antagonists would consider the use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. It would be a mistake to believe the nuclear taboo can somehow magically keep nuclear weapons from being used in the context of an unstable strategic framework. Systemic asymmetries between actors in fact suggest a certain increase in the probability of war – a war in which escalation could happen quickly and from a variety of participants. Once such a war starts, events would likely develop a momentum all their own and decision-making would consequently be shaped in unpredictable ways. The international community must take this possibility seriously, and muster every tool at its disposal to prevent such an outcome, which would be an unprecedented disaster for the peoples of the region, with substantial risk for the entire world.",summarize the following text: ,"Strategic stability in the region is thus undermined by various factors asymmetric interests in the bargaining framework that can introduce unpredictable behavior from actors; the presence of non-state actors incompatible assumptions about the structure of the deterrent relationship perceptions by Israel and the United States that its window of opportunity for military action is closing, which could prompt a preventive attack the lack of a communications framework to build trust and cooperation among framework participants. escalation by any the parties could happen either on purpose or as a result of miscalculation it is disturbingly easy to imagine scenarios under which a conflict could quickly escalate in which the regional antagonists would consider the use of chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.

"But the question is whether it has staying power. There are good reasons to think that Isis’ caliphate could run out of steam long before it matches the great Islamic empires of history. Isis has hostile forces in every direction. It will face resistance from anti-Isis Syrian rebels in the west, the hostility of Kurds in the north, and, eventually, a counter-offensive from government forces to the south. Even if the government collapses – and we are a long way from that – then Iraq’s Shia majority will not accept a permanent jihadist state on their northern flank, let alone allow Isis to stroll into Baghdad. Saddam slaughtered Shias in 1991, and Isis has been slaughtering Shias for over a decade. The Shias have had quite enough, thank you. Iraq’s neighbours will also fight back. Ankara does not look kindly at the fact that Isis has kidnapped Turkish diplomats in Mosul. Iran is not just aghast at the rise of a radical Sunni force on its western border, but concerned about losing an ally in Baghdad that it views as more important than even Assad. Tehran is reportedly airlifting over a hundred tons of supplies to Baghdad daily, and deployed its special forces there weeks ago. If Isis attempts to conduct attacks against Western countries, as the prime minister warned last week, then it will face the near certainty of air strikes. It can hunker down safely in urban areas like Mosul, but large stretches of its territory are completely devoid of cover. It will suffer grievous losses. But Isis’ biggest challenge is closer to home. It depends on a coalition of other Sunni militants and local Sunni tribes. Without such allies, it could not possibly have walked over Iraqi security forces so easily. But coalitions like this can fall apart. Remember that Isis was defeated once before, in its previous incarnation as Al Qaida in Iraq. Their campaign of terror was quelled by 2008, thanks to a surge of US troops and the so-called ‘awakening’ of local Sunni tribes who grew tired of the group’s brutality.",summarize the following text: ,"the question is whether it has staying power Isis’ caliphate could run out of steam Isis has hostile forces in every direction It will face resistance from anti-Isis Syrian rebels in the west, the hostility of Kurds in the north, and, eventually, a counter-offensive from government forces to the south Iraq’s Shia majority will not accept a permanent jihadist state let alone allow Isis to stroll into Baghdad Iraq’s neighbours will also fight back.

"2. The CLS critique of piecemeal reform¶ Critical scholars reject the idea of piecemeal reform. Incremental change, they argue, merely postpones the wholesale reformation that must occur to create a decent society. Even worse, an unfair social system survives by using piecemeal reform to disguise and legitimize oppression. Those who control the system weaken resistance by pointing to the occasional concession to, or periodic court victory of, a black plaintiff or worker as evidence that the system is fair and¶ just. In fact, Crits believe that teaching the¶ common law or using the case method in law school is a disguised means of preaching incrementalism and thereby maintaining the current power structure.“ To avoid this, CLS scholars¶ urge law professors to abandon the case method, give up the effort to ﬁnd rationality and order¶ in the case law, and teach in an unabashedly political fashion.¶ The CLS critique of piecemeal reform is familiar, imperialistic and wrong. Minorities know from bitter experience that occasional court victories do not mean the Promised Land is at hand. The critique is imperialistic in that it tells minorities and other oppressed peoples how they should interpret events affecting them. A court order directing a housing authority to disburse funds for heating in subsidized housing may postpone the revolution, or it may not. In the meantime, the order keeps a number of poor families warm. This may mean more to them than it does to a comfortable academic working in a warm office. It smacks of paternalism to assert that the possibility of revolution later outweighs the certainty of heat now,¶ unless there is evidence for that possibility. The Crits do not offer such evidence. Indeed, some incremental changes may bring revolutionary changes closer, not push them further away. Not all small reforms induce complacency; some may whet the appetite for further combat.

"A first objection which seems inherent in Donelan’s approach is that utilizing the modern state domain of discourse in effect sanctifies the state: it assumes that people will always live in states and that it is not possible within such a language to consider alternatives to the system.  This objection is not well founded, by having recourse to the ordinary language of international relations I am not thereby committed to argue that the state system as it exists is the best mode of human political organization or that people ought always to live in states as we know them.  As I have said, my argument is that whatever proposals for piecemeal or large-scale reform of the state system are made, they must of necessity be made in the language of the modern state.  Whatever proposals are made, whether in justification or in criticism of the state system, will have to make use of concepts which are at present part and parcel of the theory of states. Thus,for example. any proposal for a new global institutional arrangement superseding the state system will itself have to be justified, and that justification will have to include within it reference to a new and good form of individual citizenship, reference to a new legislative machinery equipped with satisfactory checks and balances, reference to satisfactory law enforcement procedures, reference to a satisfactory arrangement for distributing the goods produced in the world, and so on. All of these notions are notions which have been developed and finely honed within the theory of the modern state. It is not possible to imagine a justification of a new world order succeeding which used, for example, feudal, or traditional/tribal, discourse. More generally there is no worldwide language of political morality which is not completely shot through with state-related notions such as citizenship, rights under law, representative government and so on.",summarize the following text: ,"A first objection is that utilizing the modern state domain of discourse in effect sanctifies the state: it assumes that people will always live in states and that it is not possible within such a language to consider alternatives to the system.

"STRONG STATES control their territories and deliver a high order of political goods to their citizens. They perform well according to standard indicators such as per capita GDP, the UN'S Human Development Index, Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, and Freedom House's Freedom in the World report. Strong states offer high levels of security from political and criminal violence, ensure political freedom and civil liberties, and create environments conducive to the growth of economic opportunity. They are places of peace and order.
In contrast, failed states are tense, conflicted, and dangerous. They generally share the following characteristics: a rise in criminal and political violence; a loss of control over their borders; rising ethnic, religious, linguistic, and cultural hostilities; civil war; the use of terror against their own citizens; weak institutions; a deteriorated or insufficient infrastructure; an inability to collect taxes without undue coercion; high levels of corruption; a collapsed health system; rising levels of infant mortality and declining life expectancy; the end of regular schooling opportunities; declining levels of GDP per capita; escalating inflation; a widespread preference for non-national currencies; and basic food shortages, leading to starvation. Failed states also face rising attacks on their fundamental legitimacy. As a state's capacity weakens and its rulers work exclusively for themselves, key interest groups show less and less loyalty to the state. The people's sense of political community vanishes and citizens feel disenfranchised and marginalized. The social contract that binds citizens and central structures is forfeit. Perhaps already divided by sectional differences and animosity, citizens transfer their allegiances to communal warlords. Domestic anarchy sets in. The rise of terrorist groups becomes more likely.",summarize the following text: ,"STRONG STATES control their territories and deliver a high order of political goods Strong states offer high levels of security from political and criminal violence, ensure political freedom and civil liberties, and create environments conducive to the growth of economic opportunity.

"Any white paper that includes a policy review of drug legislation must include key term definitions that are clear, accurate, and coherent. Thus, there are various definitions of „legalization‟ of marijuana use and commerce strewn across countless reports, papers and analyses of drug policy. It is critical to note that legalization and decriminalization are terms for very different proposals even though they are sometimes conflated. Decriminalization proposes the removal of the criminal penalty for possession of marijuana, but not for its trafficking and production. „Legalization‟ authorizes the possession, production and trafficking of marijuana, and therefore enables the state to tax and regulate its sale and consumption.4 This study takes a holistic approach to examining how legalization of marijuana in the United States would affect Mexican DTOs. However, in the United States there has been no example of true marijuana legalization since the inception of the modern drug control regime. This is why our case studies will look at changes that occurred after various countries relaxed their system of marijuana prohibition. We will look at decriminalization in Mexico and Portugal, as well as a special case of toleration/de facto legalization in the Netherlands. However, we will first lay out in detail what each type of change entails. Decriminalization is one of the most common methods employed by countries that seek to ease or lighten anti-marijuana policies. A common definition of decriminalization is “the removal of the criminal sanction for possession,” in effect making the penalty for the possession of marijuana a civil (fines, counseling etc), rather than criminal offense. 5 One common example of this type of reform is the 2001 Law 30/2000 in Portugal. What is important here is that criminal penalties for possession are removed, but there is still some type of civil sanction in place that punishes both users and producers. This is what separates decriminalization from legalization.",summarize the following text: ,"legalization and decriminalization are terms for very different proposals even though they are sometimes conflated Decriminalization proposes the removal of the criminal penalty for possession of marijuana, but not for its trafficking and production „Legalization‟ authorizes the possession, production and trafficking of marijuana, and therefore enables the state to tax and regulate its sale and consumption A common definition of decriminalization is “the removal of the criminal sanction for possession,” in effect making the penalty for the possession of marijuana a civil rather than criminal offense What is important here is that criminal penalties for possession are removed, but there is still some type of civil sanction in place that punishes both users and producers.

"But the question is whether it has staying power. There are good reasons to think that Isis’ caliphate could run out of steam long before it matches the great Islamic empires of history. Isis has hostile forces in every direction. It will face resistance from anti-Isis Syrian rebels in the west, the hostility of Kurds in the north, and, eventually, a counter-offensive from government forces to the south. Even if the government collapses – and we are a long way from that – then Iraq’s Shia majority will not accept a permanent jihadist state on their northern flank, let alone allow Isis to stroll into Baghdad. Saddam slaughtered Shias in 1991, and Isis has been slaughtering Shias for over a decade. The Shias have had quite enough, thank you. Iraq’s neighbours will also fight back. Ankara does not look kindly at the fact that Isis has kidnapped Turkish diplomats in Mosul. Iran is not just aghast at the rise of a radical Sunni force on its western border, but concerned about losing an ally in Baghdad that it views as more important than even Assad. Tehran is reportedly airlifting over a hundred tons of supplies to Baghdad daily, and deployed its special forces there weeks ago. If Isis attempts to conduct attacks against Western countries, as the prime minister warned last week, then it will face the near certainty of air strikes. It can hunker down safely in urban areas like Mosul, but large stretches of its territory are completely devoid of cover. It will suffer grievous losses. But Isis’ biggest challenge is closer to home. It depends on a coalition of other Sunni militants and local Sunni tribes. Without such allies, it could not possibly have walked over Iraqi security forces so easily. But coalitions like this can fall apart. Remember that Isis was defeated once before, in its previous incarnation as Al Qaida in Iraq. Their campaign of terror was quelled by 2008, thanks to a surge of US troops and the so-called ‘awakening’ of local Sunni tribes who grew tired of the group’s brutality.",summarize the following text: ,"the question is whether it has staying power Isis’ caliphate could run out of steam Isis has hostile forces in every direction It will face resistance from anti-Isis Syrian rebels in the west, the hostility of Kurds in the north, and, eventually, a counter-offensive from government forces to the south Iraq’s Shia majority will not accept a permanent jihadist state let alone allow Isis to stroll into Baghdad Iraq’s neighbours will also fight back.

"Short-term Effects on Mexican DTOs and Security Implications  Mexican DTOs would likely branch into other avenues of crime. Perhaps the most obvious short-term effect of marijuana legalization is that this would rob the Sinaloa and Tijuana cartels of up to half of their total revenue.117 The economic strain placed on the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel may not necessarily help Mexico in the short term. The short-term effects of legalization could very well create chaos for Mexico. “The cartels compensate for their loss of drug revenue by branching out into other criminal activities--kidnapping, murder-for-hire, contraband, illegal 29 immigrant smuggling, extortion, theft of oil and other items, loan-sharking, prostitution, selling protection, etc.”118 This means that if the social and economic environment remains the same then “they are not going to return to the licit world.”119 If the Sinaloa cartel and the Tijuana cartel turn towards activities like kidnapping, human trafficking and extortion, it could lead to a spike in violence that would prove to be destabilizing in those organizations‟ areas of operation.  The Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel might splinter into smaller groups. In addition, the loss of more than 40% of revenue would probably force them to downsize their operations. Like any large business going through downsizing, employees will likely be shed first in order to maintain profitability.120 These former DTO operatives will likely not return to earning a legitimate income, but rather will independently find new revenue sources in a manner similar to their employers. Therefore it is possible that the legalization of marijuana in the United States could cause territories currently under the control of the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel to become more violent than they are today. This is troubling, as Sinaloa, Baja California, Sonora, and Chihuahua states are already among the most violent areas of Mexico.121",summarize the following text: ,"Mexican DTOs would likely branch into other avenues of crime. the most obvious short-term effect of marijuana legalization is that this would rob the Sinaloa and Tijuana cartels of up to half of their total revenue.

"International Law. Another complication for legalization is international law. While many researchers attempt to make international comparisons in studying drugs, one area of drug control policy that receives scant attention is the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 which binds all UN member nations to maintain prohibition of drugs, including cannabis specifically (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 61). While the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs requires that countries maintain prohibition of manufacture, sales, and import, it does not require a punitive regime of the type currently found in the United States. Article 36 of the Single Convention, “Penal Provision,” specifically allows for treatment programs to either enhance or serve as a substitute for punishment.81 The Economist reports that countries like the Netherlands are able to allow for some innovation in controlling marijuana use through the convention’s commentary, which states that its goal is “improvement of the efficacy of national criminal justice systems in the field of drug trafficking” (“A Toker’s Guide” 2009). Thus, reforms working within the framework of the existing treaty are possible, though full- scale legalization would require either a country’s withdrawal from the treaty or revision thereof. Perhaps partly due to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, even countries with more liberal narcotics policies than the United States lack full- fledged drug legalization and at most allow for depenalization of marijuana and/ or widespread needle exchange programs. As discussed above, in the Netherlands, a country long known for its tolerance of marijuana smoking, the importation and commercial production of cannabis remains illegal (Levine and Reinarman 2006, 64). When considering its own drug reform, Portugal declined to adopt outright legalization likely in part because of its treaty obligations under the 1961 Single Convention (Cato Institute 2009).",summarize the following text: ,"Another complication for legalization is international law the Single Convention binds all UN member nations to maintain prohibition of drugs, including cannabis specifically While the Single Convention requires that countries maintain prohibition it does not require a punitive regime reforms working within the framework of the existing treaty are possible, though full- scale legalization would require either a country’s withdrawal  or revision due to the Single Convention even countries with more liberal narcotics policies lack full- fledged drug legalization in the Netherlands the importation and commercial production of cannabis remains illegal"

WASHINGTON – A massive, countrywide power failure like the one in India on Tuesday is ""extremely unlikely"" in the United States, energy experts say.
In India, three of the country's government-operated power grids failed Tuesday, leaving 620 million people without electricity for several hours. The outage, the second in two days in the country of 1.21 billion people, is the world's biggest blackout on record.
The U.S. electricity system is segmented into three parts with safeguards that prevent an outage in one system from tripping a blackout in another system, ""making blackouts across the country extremely unlikely,"" Energy Department spokeswoman Keri Fulton said.
Early reports from government officials in India say excessive demand knocked the country's power generators offline. Experts say India's industry and economy are growing faster than its electrical systems. Last year, the economy grew 7.8% and pushed energy needs higher, but electricity generation did not keep pace, government records show.
""We are much, much less at risk for something like that happening here, especially from the perspective of demand exceeding supply,"" said Gregory Reed, a professor of electric power engineering at University of Pittsburgh. ""We're much more sophisticated in our operations. Most of our issues have been from natural disasters.""
The U.S. generates more than enough electricity to meet demand and always have power in reserve, Reed said.
""Fundamentally, it's a different world here,"" said Arshad Mansoor, senior vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute in Washington and an expert on power grids. ""It's an order of magnitude more reliable here than in a developing country.""
Grid operators across the country analyze power usage and generation, factoring outside factors such as weather, in real time and can forecast power supply and demand hour by hour, Mansoor said.",summarize the following text: ,"– A massive, countrywide power failure like the one in India  is ""extremely unlikely"" in the U S , energy experts say

"The House of Representatives gave a thumbs-up Wednesday to allowing the marijuana industry into the banking system. The legislation, which passed by a 231-192 margin, would prohibit the use of federal funds to penalize banks and credit unions for providing financial services to state-licensed pot businesses. It is unclear if the measure will make a difference for banks and credit unions that are weighing the risks involved with serving the pot business. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law, but numerous states have legalized its medicinal or recreational use, and that conflict puts banks in a difficult position. Still, the House vote marks another step in the direction of bringing marijuana enterprises into the financial mainstream. In February, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network released guidance for banks interested in serving the pot industry. The House measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 45 Republicans, and was hailed by the marijuana industry as a landmark. ""This is a huge step forward for the legal cannabis industry,"" Aaron Smith, executive director of the National Cannabis Industry Association, said in a news release. The legislation, which was introduced as an amendment to a financial services appropriations bill, has yet to pass in the Senate. The House version was sponsored by Democratic Reps. Denny Heck, Ed Perlmutter and Barbara Lee and GOP Rep. Dana Rohrabacher. A competing amendment, which would have blocked the implementation of the Fincen guidance on marijuana, was defeated by a 236-186 margin. Since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, a coalition that includes the pot industry, elected officials, and law enforcement agencies in those states have been calling for marijuana businesses to be brought into the banking system. They argue that as long as pot enterprises operate as cash-only businesses, they are susceptible to threats such as armed robbery and money laundering.",summarize the following text: ,"The House gave a thumbs-up to allowing the marijuana industry into the banking system The legislation, which passed by a 231-192 margin, would prohibit the use of federal funds to penalize banks and credit unions for providing financial services to state-licensed pot businesses. the House vote marks another step in the direction of bringing marijuana enterprises into the financial mainstream The House measure passed with the support of 186 Democrats and 45 Republicans and was hailed by the marijuana industry as a landmark This is a huge step forward for the legal cannabis industry The legislation has yet to pass in the Senate Since recreational marijuana was legalized in Colorado and Washington state, a coalition that includes the pot industry, elected officials, and law enforcement agencies in those states have been calling for marijuana businesses to be brought into the banking system"
