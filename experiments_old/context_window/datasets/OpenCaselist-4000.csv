Bioethics can be seen as having no defined essence which sets it apart as a distinct study or discipline. Rather, its individuation derives from a de facto set of issues interrelated by what might be termed ""family resemblances."" While a common thread joining all of the issues is exceedingly difficult to find, the central core comprising the list of these issues, without question, is a felt concern over the technology of control of man's body, his mind, and quality of life. Many of the concerns of bioethics are concerns of public policy—or with legislation and policy guidelines—at state, local, and federal levels, that need to be enacted and enforced with respect to all of the issues comprising the de facto set. It has been suggested that bioethical concerns are but those prohibitions all rational people urge everyone to follow in an effort to avoid evils on which common agreement exists. Outside the individual context of determining how one treats another, for moral acceptability to be given at the broader societal level, a democratic consensus must be reached acknowledging that a certain good must be promoted though its promotion causes some degree of harm. It is within this setting where much of what is recognized as ""bioethics"" is focused. While individual morality operates primarily within a system of restraints, policies affecting society as a whole operate on a level where promotion of good is a moral option. The pivotal question thus becomes, ""what goods ought to be restrained (e.g., scientific research)?"" Of necessity, priorities, values, and goods must be weighed, balanced, and compared. Whenever the benefits and the risks of a particular course of action are weighed, it is well remembered that those very elements in the balancing test are based upon judgments about values, with the penultimate goal being the formulation and validation of a final action which minimizes human suffering and maximizes the social good. 5 In a more specific sense, bioethics encompasses a whole political movement. 6 It is a movement which seeks to harness political forces to deal with a plethora of ethical problems relating to health care delivery, both at the micro and the macro level of economic distribution. It also endeavors to respond—often through legislative reforms—to complex issues such as physician assisted suicide, cryonic suspension, genetic discrimination in the workplace, abortion, privacy, sterilization, human experimentation, collaborative reproduction by use of in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, cloning, and personal relationships necessary to create a family by homosexuals and lesbians. 7 All too often, contemporary society's concerns over the need for regulating ethical regimes to guide or even control these activities has driven it in turn to seek medical laws about areas such as death and dying, genetic counseling and screening, reproductive technologies, and organ transplants. Often there is little choice for legal passivity or inaction since ""the law is a primary vehicle for resolving disagreements about public policy and the treatment of real persons.""8 And today, Americans seem to be reshaping their political questions ultimately into judicial questions.9 Yet, a healthy degree of skepticism is needed to see the inherent limitations on the legal system in its efforts to regulate biomedical developments. 10 Each legal tool used must be constantly fine-tuned and re-evaluated by ever changing public policies—all with the purpose of determining which of the tools is best fitted to deal with specific biomedical problems"" and which one validates a final action that ideally minimizes human suffering and maximizes the social or common good.",3907.0,"<h4><strong>Focused debate over state regulations of PAS are key to cost-benefit analysis and deliberation -- the alternative is abstract moral relativism that fails to translate into material change</h4><p>Smith 99</p><p></strong>George, Professor of Law @ The Catholic University of America, Notre Dame Journal Of Law, Ethics & Public Policy, Vol. 13, “Judicial Decision-Making in the Age of Biotechnology”, AB </p><p><u><strong>Bioethics can be seen as having no defined essence</u></strong> which sets it apart as a distinct study or discipline.

Moreover, by exploiting the vulnerability of the captive body as a vessel for the uses, thoughts, and feelings of others, the humanity extended to the slave inadvertently confirms the expectations and desires definitive of the relations of chattel slavery. In other words, the ease of Rankin’s empathetic identification is as much due to his good intentions and heartfelt opposition to slavery as to the fungibility of the captive body. By making the suffering of others his own, has Rankin ameliorated indifference or only confirmed the difficulty of understanding the suffering of the enslaved? Can the white witness of the spectacle of suffering affirm the materiality of black sentience only by feeling for himself? Does this not only exacerbate the idea that black sentience is inconceivable and unimaginable but, in the very ease of possessing the abased and enslaved body, ultimately elide an understanding and acknowledgement of the slave’s pain? Beyond evidence of slavery’s crime, what does this exposure of the suffering body of the bondsman yield? Does this not reinforce the “thingly” quality of the captive by reducing the body to evidence in the very effort to establish the humanity of the enslaved? Does it not reproduce the hyperembodiness of the powerless? The purpose of these inquiries is not to cast doubt on Rankin’s motives for recounting these events but to consider the precariousness of empathy and the thin line between witness and spectator. In the fantasy of being beaten, Rankin must substitute himself and his wife and children for the black captive in order that this pain can be perceived and experienced. So, in fact, Rankin becomes a proxy and the other’s pain is acknowledged to the degree that it can be imagined, yet by virtue of this substitution the object of identification threatens to disappear. In order to convince the reader of the horrors of slavery, Rankin must volunteer himself and his family for abasement. Put differently, the effort to counteract the commonplace callousness to black suffering requires that the white body be positioned in the place of the black body in order to make this suffering visible and intelligible. Yet if this violence can become palpable and indignation can be fully aroused only through the masochistic fantasy, then it becomes clear that empathy is double-edged, for in making the other’s suffering one’s own, this suffering is occluded by the other’s obliteration. Given the litany of horrors that fill Rankin’s pages, this recourse to fantasy reveals an anxiety about making the slave’s suffering legible. This anxiety is historically determined by the denial of black sentience, the slave’s status as object of property, the predicament of witnessing given the legal status of blacks, and the repression of counterdiscourses on the “peculiar institution.“ Therefore, Rankin must supplant the black captive in order to give expression to black suffering, and as a consequence, the dilemma – the denial of black sentience and the obscurity of suffering – is not attenuated but instantiated. The ambivalent character of empathy-more exactly, the repressive effects of empathy-as Jonathan Boyarin notes, can be located in the “obliteration of otherness” or the facile intimacy that enables identification with the other only as we “feel ourselves into those we imagine as ourselves.” And as a consequence, empathy fails to expand the space of the other but merely places the self in its stead.",3966.0,"<h4>Specifically negative in this context: The AFF calls for your empathetic identification with their narrative and identity as presented in the 1AC.

Within this gambling aura, <u><strong>experts commonly refer to Internet gambling as “crack cocaine” for addicting new gamblers.</u></strong> Internet gambling would place the worst type of computer gambling at every school desk, at every work desk, in every living room and on every cell phone. In an instant, a person could “click the mouse and lose the house.” Again, 60 Minutes highlights these problems in its video “Slot Machines: The Big Gamble.” With justification, gambling lobbyists brag that Internet gambling is the “killer application” — killing both individual and institutional finances. <u><strong>Countries cannot gamble their way to prosperity. <mark>Internet gambling shrinks the consumer economy and destroys consumer confidence by promoting a ubiquitous gambling philosophy</mark>. <mark>Legalizing U.S. online gambling would allow dubious parties to tout the U.S. imprimatur — empowering them to create a queue of speculative bubbles that could collapse already fragile financial systems and destabilize essential international economic security.</p></u></strong></mark>",1NC,OFF CASE,1NC Economy DA,429669,20,16965,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/BaSh/Baylor-Barron-Sheaff-Neg-Wake-Round3.docx,564694,N,Wake,3,Michigan KK,Logan Gramzinski,"1AC OG  Laundering Trade Econ

Bioethics can be seen as having no defined essence which sets it apart as a distinct study or discipline. Rather, its individuation derives from a de facto set of issues interrelated by what might be termed ""family resemblances."" While a common thread joining all of the issues is exceedingly difficult to find, the central core comprising the list of these issues, without question, is a felt concern over the technology of control of man's body, his mind, and quality of life. Many of the concerns of bioethics are concerns of public policy—or with legislation and policy guidelines—at state, local, and federal levels, that need to be enacted and enforced with respect to all of the issues comprising the de facto set. It has been suggested that bioethical concerns are but those prohibitions all rational people urge everyone to follow in an effort to avoid evils on which common agreement exists. Outside the individual context of determining how one treats another, for moral acceptability to be given at the broader societal level, a democratic consensus must be reached acknowledging that a certain good must be promoted though its promotion causes some degree of harm. It is within this setting where much of what is recognized as ""bioethics"" is focused. While individual morality operates primarily within a system of restraints, policies affecting society as a whole operate on a level where promotion of good is a moral option. The pivotal question thus becomes, ""what goods ought to be restrained (e.g., scientific research)?"" Of necessity, priorities, values, and goods must be weighed, balanced, and compared. Whenever the benefits and the risks of a particular course of action are weighed, it is well remembered that those very elements in the balancing test are based upon judgments about values, with the penultimate goal being the formulation and validation of a final action which minimizes human suffering and maximizes the social good. 5 In a more specific sense, bioethics encompasses a whole political movement. 6 It is a movement which seeks to harness political forces to deal with a plethora of ethical problems relating to health care delivery, both at the micro and the macro level of economic distribution. It also endeavors to respond—often through legislative reforms—to complex issues such as physician assisted suicide, cryonic suspension, genetic discrimination in the workplace, abortion, privacy, sterilization, human experimentation, collaborative reproduction by use of in vitro fertilization, artificial insemination, cloning, and personal relationships necessary to create a family by homosexuals and lesbians. 7 All too often, contemporary society's concerns over the need for regulating ethical regimes to guide or even control these activities has driven it in turn to seek medical laws about areas such as death and dying, genetic counseling and screening, reproductive technologies, and organ transplants. Often there is little choice for legal passivity or inaction since ""the law is a primary vehicle for resolving disagreements about public policy and the treatment of real persons.""8 And today, Americans seem to be reshaping their political questions ultimately into judicial questions.9 Yet, a healthy degree of skepticism is needed to see the inherent limitations on the legal system in its efforts to regulate biomedical developments. 10 Each legal tool used must be constantly fine-tuned and re-evaluated by ever changing public policies—all with the purpose of determining which of the tools is best fitted to deal with specific biomedical problems"" and which one validates a final action that ideally minimizes human suffering and maximizes the social or common good.",3907.0,"<h4>B.)

Although the world on average generates more and more wealth, the riches do not appear to ""trickle down"" to the poor and improve their material well-being. Instead, poverty and economic inequality is growing. Despite the existence of development aid for more than half a century, the Third World seems not to be ""catching up"" with the First World. Instead, militarism, dictatorship and human repression is multiplied. Since the mid 1970, the critique of global economic activities has intensified due to the escalating deterioration of the natural environment. Modernization, industrialisation and its economic activities have been directly linked to increased scarcity of natural resources and generation of pollution, which increases global temperatures and degrades soils, lands, water, forests and air. The latter threat is of great significance, because without a healthy environment human beings and animals will not be able to survive. Most people believed that modernization of the world would improve material well-being for all. However, faced with its negative side effects and the real threat of extinction, one must conclude that somewhere along the way ""progress"" went astray. Instead of material plenty, economic development generated a violent, unhealthy and unequal world. It is a world where a small minority live in material luxury, while millions of people live in misery. These poor people are marginalized by the global economic system. They are forced to survive from degraded environments; they live without personal or social security; they live in abject poverty, with hunger, malnutrition and sickness; and they have no possibility to speak up for themselves and demand a fair share of the world's resources. The majority of these people are women, children, traditional peoples, tribal peoples, people of colour and materially poor people (called women and Others). They are, together with nature, dominated by the global system of economic development imposed by the North. It is this scenario, which is the subject of the dissertation. The overall aim is consequently to discuss the unjustified domination of women, Others and nature and to show how the domination of women and Others is interconnected with the domination of nature. A good place to start a discussion about domination of women, Others and nature is to disclose how they disproportionately must carry the negative effects from global economic development. The below discussion is therefore meant to give an idea of the ""flip-side"" of modernisation. It gives a gloomy picture of what ""progress"" and its focus on economic growth has meant for women, poor people and the natural environment. The various complex and inter-connected, negative impacts have been ordered into four crises. The categorization is inspired by Paul Ekins and his 1992 book ""A new world order; grassroots movements for global change"". In it, Ekins argues that humanity is faced with four interlocked crises of unprecedented magnitude. These crises have the potential to destroy whole ecosystems and to extinct the human race. The first crisis is the spread of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction, together with the high level of military spending. The second crisis is the increasing number of people afflicted with hunger and poverty. The third crisis is the environmental degradation. Pollution, destruction of ecosystems and extinction of species are increasing at such a rate that the biosphere is under threat. The fourth crisis is repression and denial of fundamental human rights by governments, which prevents people from developing their potential. It is highly likely that one may add more crises to these four, or categorize them differently, however, Ekins's division is suitable for the present purpose.

Fear is likeliest to escalate into panic or denial when it is treated as wrong","Let’s start with the obvious. Any normal person is going to be more anxious than usual while awaiting a biopsy result, a turbulent airplane landing, or a l8ayoff notice. Human emotions tend to match the situation. The same is true of a more widespread threat. Of course the public at large will be commensurately alarmed when told that a terrorism attack, an epidemic, or a hurricane may be approaching. Moreover, fear isn’t just normal in frightening situations; it is functional. Both the human body and the body politic ultimately benefit from the changes (physiological and sociological ... and inevitably emotional) that accompany preparedness for crisis.  Take terrorism as a case in point. Nearly everyone agrees that we need people to be vigilant for indications of terrorist attacks; to prepare themselves and their families to cope with possible attacks; to be supportive of preparedness expenses and tolerant of preparedness inconveniences. And nearly everyone agrees that we need all this to ramp up in an actual attack, so that people put other agendas on hold, follow instructions willingly, and help care for their neighbors. The question is what emotional state, what state of mind, is conducive to this sort of public readiness.  We believe the right answer is fear. We won’t get there if terrorism is merely one of many issues people are “concerned” about, along with West Nile Virus and inflation and rap lyrics. Either terrorism is different from most other concerns, or it isn’t. If it is, we need to get used to the idea that people are going to be appropriately frightened, and we need to help them get used to it too.  Not all fear is functional. Fear that is paralyzing, fear that verges on panic, is obviously not functional. Terror is the goal of terrorism, not the goal of preparedness. But fear is not necessarily terror. This is a conceptual mistake officials routinely make, a mistake they seem terribly attracted to — the embedded, preconscious, erroneous assumption that all fear is one short step removed from panic. Some fear is. Most fear is not.  When officials express their reluctance about “unduly frightening people,” they are literally right. The key word here is “unduly.” Unduly frightening people is wrong. Duly frightening people is right, and important. The problem is telling the two apart.  The distinction is partly a matter of degree — “enough” fear versus “excessive” fear. Perhaps in addition there are kinds of fear like the kinds of cholesterol — “good” fear versus “bad” fear. But we suspect the key difference is neither the amount of fear nor the kind of fear, but rather people’s ability to bear the fear. Much is known about how to enhance that ability. Among the things that help:  Give people things to do — action binds anxiety. Give people things to decide — decision-making provides more individual control, which makes fear more tolerable. Encourage appropriate anger — the desire to get even often trumps the desire to cower. Encourage love (and camaraderie) — soldiers, for example, fight for their friends and for their country. Provide candid leadership — we get more frightened when our leaders seem to be misleading us.  Show your own fear and show you can bear it — apparently fearless leaders are little help to a fearful public.  Most importantly, treat other people’s fear as legitimate. Fear is likeliest to escalate into terror or panic (or to flip into denial) when it is treated as shameful and wrong. “It’s natural to be afraid, I’m afraid too” is a much more empathic response to public fear than “there’s nothing to be afraid of.” If we want people to bear their fear, we must assure them that their fear is appropriate. Even fear that is statistically inappropriate can and should be legitimized as normal, understandable, and widespread.

Nearly everyone agrees that we need people to be vigilant for indications of terrorist attacks; to prepare themselves and their families to cope with possible attacks; to be supportive of preparedness expenses and tolerant of preparedness inconveniences. And nearly everyone agrees that we need all this to ramp up in an actual attack, so that people put other agendas on hold, follow instructions willingly, and help care for their neighbors. The question is what emotional state, what state of mind, is conducive to this sort of public readiness.  We believe the right answer is fear. <u><strong>We won’t get there if terrorism is merely one of many issues people are “concerned” about, along with West Nile Virus and inflation and rap lyrics. Either <mark>terrorism is different</mark> from most other concerns, or it isn’t. If it is, we need to get used to the idea that <mark>people are going to be appropriately frightened</mark>,</u></strong> and we need to help them get used to it too.  Not all fear is functional. <u><strong><mark>Fear that </mark>is paralyzing</u></strong>, fear that <u><strong><mark>verges on panic, is</mark> obviously <mark>not functional</mark>. Terror is the goal of terrorism, not the goal of preparedness. But <mark>fear is not</mark> necessarily <mark>terror. This is a</mark> conceptual <mark>mistake officials</mark> routinely <mark>make</u></strong></mark>, a mistake they seem terribly attracted to — <u><strong><mark>the embedded</mark>, preconscious, erroneous <mark>assumption that all fear is one</mark> short <mark>step removed from panic</u></strong></mark>. Some fear is. Most fear is not.  When officials express their reluctance about “unduly frightening people,” they are literally right. The key word here is “unduly.” <u><strong>Unduly frightening people is wrong. <mark>Duly frightening people is right</mark>,</u></strong> and important. The problem is telling the two apart.  The distinction is partly a matter of degree — “enough” fear versus “excessive” fear. Perhaps in addition there are kinds of fear like the kinds of cholesterol — “good” fear versus “bad” fear. But we suspect <u><strong><mark>the</mark> key <mark>difference</mark> <mark>is</mark> neither the amount of fear nor the kind of fear, but rather <mark>people’s ability to bear the fear</mark>. Much is known about how to enhance that ability</u></strong>. Among the things that help:  <u><strong><mark>Give people things to do</mark> — action binds anxiety. Give people things <mark>to decide</mark> — decision-making provides more individual control</u></strong>, which makes fear more tolerable. <u><strong><mark>Encourage appropriate anger</u></strong></mark> — the desire to get even often trumps the desire to cower. <u><strong>Encourage love (and camaraderie</u></strong>) — soldiers, for example, fight for their friends and for their country. <u><strong><mark>Provide candid leadership</mark> — we get more frightened when our leaders seem to be misleading us.  Show your own fear and show you can bear it </u></strong>— apparently fearless leaders are little help to a fearful public.  Most importantly, <u><strong><mark>treat other people’s fear as legitimate. Fear is likeliest to escalate into</mark> terror or <mark>panic</mark> (<mark>or</mark> to flip into <mark>denial</mark>) <mark>when it is treated as</mark> shameful and <mark>wrong</u></strong></mark>. “It’s natural to be afraid, I’m afraid too” is a much more empathic response to public fear than “there’s nothing to be afraid of.” If we want people to bear their fear, we must assure them that their fear is appropriate. Even fear that is statistically inappropriate can and should be legitimized as normal, understandable, and widespread. <u><strong>Leaders who are contemptuous of people’s fear have a much tougher time explaining the reasons why they needn’t be afraid.  </p></u></strong>",2NC,Case,2NC Ext #3 -- FoD Good,381485,6,16968,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/BaSh/Baylor-Barron-Sheaff-Neg-UNLV-Quarters.docx,564691,N,UNLV,Quarters,Texas KS,"Cheek, Ryan Paul, Amy Cram, Travis","1AC - PAS Death Control

Sixth, and perhaps most important of all, physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are apparently not the real issues being raised by suffering patients and policymakers, nor the best answer to their concerns. It is essential to have a solid grip on the root motivations for calls for assisted death, whether made by individu- als or the larger society, and to respond to the root cause before the overt call is evaluated on face value. Treatment of the root cause is far more reliable, safe, and effective than treatment of the presenting complaint alone. This is a matter of sound clinical and social policy practice. Strong data all point to the predominance of psychosocial, contextual suffering or fear of suffering as moti- vators, rather than current, unbearable, unrelievable, pathophysi- ological suffering. Most requesters are motivated not by pain but by fear: fear of future suffering, fear of indignity, fear of burden- someness, fear of abandonment, and fear of lost control. The severity of psychOsocial suffering need not be understated to stand by this argument. Rather, the point is that psychosocial suffering should be treated by ameliorating its sources, not by eliminating the victim. Unfortunately, the widely acknowledged difficultyof assessing and lessening psychosocial suffering is a factorthat could ~ake physicians more prone to misuse of physi- cian-assistedsuicide and euthanasia if it were legalized. Sothis is the position to which the reflective process of editing thisvolumehas led me: In a very real sense, the current physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia debate in the United States is a false debate. If society takes the call for legally endorsed physi- cian-assistedsuicide and euthanasia on face value alone, and if themedicalprofession as a whole or physicians in particular take patients' calls for physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia on facevalue alone, society, the profession, and physicians will have madea graveerror, Without better understanding of the fears that drive these requests, policies will be enacted and acts taken that not only miss the point but risk abuse. Some of history's great mistakes have been founded on misconceptions no greater than this failure to examine root causes. Positions on whether or not physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia are ever justifiable neednot hinder us from reaching a consensus on the need to pursuethis investigation. A responsible society and a responsible professionwould not wish to pursue contentious policy, and a professionalwould not wish to act for reasons that turn out to havebeen beside the point and risky.

We do not have a healthy place in societyfor the dying and for rituals surrounding death. Cultural health and personal maturity require a balanced place for the realities of normal dying. Perhaps the physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia debate is evidence that society is beginning to climb out of its death-denying phase.

[Slavoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, Conversations with Zizek, 2004, p. 14-16]","our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the constitutive violence of today’s global capitalism and its obscene naturalization / anonymization of the millions who are subjugated by it throughout the world. in order to create a universal global system the forces of capitalism seek to conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a kind of gentrification of that system. the gentrification of global liberal capitalism fundamentally reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast sectors of the world’s populations. neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place. the human cost in terms of inherent global poverty and degraded ‘life-chances’ cannot be calculated within the existing economic rationale and, social exclusion remains mystified and nameless this mystification is magnified through capitalism’s profound capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation.

Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek’s point is rather that in rejecting economism we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the lives and destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In particular we should not overlook Marx’s central insight that in order to create a universal global system the forces of capitalism seek to conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that the gentrification of global liberal capitalism is one whose ‘universalism’ fundamentally reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast sectors of the world’s populations. In this way, neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place. Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least for the central capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal and its price in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to say, the human cost in terms of inherent global poverty and degraded ‘life-chances’ cannot be calculated within the existing economic rationale and, in consequence, social exclusion remains mystified and nameless (viz. the patronizing reference to the ‘developing world’). And Zizek’s point is that this mystification is magnified through capitalism’s profound capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation. Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.  Against this Zizek argues for a new universalism whose primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of social existence are founded on exclusion on a global scale. While it is perfectly true that universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-particular embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek’s universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.",4041.0,"<h4><strong>The impact is global violence </h4><p>Zizek and Daly 04 </p><p></strong>[Slavoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, Conversations with Zizek, 2004, p. 14-16]</p><p>For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that <u><strong><mark>our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the</mark> constitutive <mark>violence of today’s global capitalism and its obscene naturalization</mark> / anonymization <mark>of the millions who are subjugated by it throughout the world.</u></strong></mark> Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism.

This extraordinary change in regime brings with it the promise of a deep change in attitudes and aspirations of Americans, a change that will lead, hopefully, to new directions in their nation’s policies and action. In particular, we can hope that from being a very reluctant partner in global discussions, especially on issues relating to environment and sustainable development, the United States will become an active leader in international efforts to address the Millennial threats now confronting civilization and even the survival of the human species. For the conservation of biodiversity, so essential to maintaining life on Earth, this promise of change has come not a moment too soon. It would be a mistake to put all of our hopes on the shoulder of one young man, however capable he might be. The environmental challenges the world is facing cannot be addressed by one country, let alone by one man. At the same time, an inspired US President guided by competent people, who does not shy away from exercising the true responsibilities and leadership his country is capable of, could do a lot to spur the international community into action. To paraphrase one of his illustrious predecessors, “the world asks for action and action now.” What was true in President Roosevelt’s America 77 years ago is even more appropriate today. From IUCN’s perspective, the first signals are encouraging. The US has seriously begun to discuss constructive engagement in climate change debates. With Copenhagen a mere 11 months away, this commitment is long overdue and certainly very welcome. Many governments still worry that if they set tough standards to control carbon emissions, their industry and agriculture will become uncompetitive, a fear that leads to a foot-dragging “you go first” attitude that is blocking progress. A positive intervention by the United States could provide the vital catalyst that moves the basis of the present negotiations beyond the narrowly defined national interests that lie at the heart of the current impasse. The logjam in international negotiations on climate change should not be difficult to break if the US were to lead the industrialized countries to agree that much of their wealth has been acquired at the expense of the environment (in this case greenhouse gases emitted over the past two hundred years) and that with the some of the benefits that this wealth has brought, comes the obligation to deal with the problems that have resulted as side-effects. With equitable entitlement to the common resources of the planet, an agreement that is fair and acceptable to all nations should be easy enough to achieve. Caps on emissions and sharing of energy efficient technologies are simply in the interest of everyone, rich or poor. And both rich and poor must now be ready to adopt less destructive technologies – based on renewables, efficiency and sustainability – both as a goal with intrinsic merit and also as an example to others. But climate is not the only critical global environmental issue that this new administration will have to deal with. Conservation of biodiversity, a crucial prerequisite for the wellbeing of all humanity, no less America, needs as much attention, and just as urgently. The United States’ self-interest in conserving living natural resources strongly converges with the global common good in every sphere: in the oceans, by arresting the precipitate decline of fish stocks and the alarming rise of acidification; on land, by regenerating the health of our soils, forests and rivers; and in the atmosphere by reducing the massive emission of pollutants from our wasteful industries, construction, agriculture and transport systems.",4016.0,"<h4>Obama action on climate solves extinction</h4><p><strong>Khosla 9</strong>,<Ashok, IUCN President, International Union for Conservation of Nature, A new President for the United States: We have a dream, 1-29-09, http://cms.iucn.org/news_events/?uNewsID=2595</p><p><u><strong>A rejuvenated America, with a renewed purpose, commitment and energy to make its contribution once again towards a better world could well be the turning point that can reverse the current decline in</u></strong> the state of the global economy, <u><strong>the health of its life support systems</u></strong> and the morale of people everywhere.

In particular, <u><strong>we can hope that from being a very reluctant partner in global discussions</u></strong>, especially <u><strong>on issues relating to environment and sustainable development, <mark>the United States will become an active leader in international efforts to address</mark> the</u></strong> Millennial <u><strong><mark>threats</mark> now <mark>confronting civilization</mark> <mark>and</mark> even <mark>the survival of the human species</u></strong>. <u><strong>For the conservation of biodiversi</mark>ty, so essential to maintaining <mark>life on Earth</mark>, this promise of change has come not a moment too soon</u></strong>. It would be a mistake to put all of our hopes on the shoulder of one young man, however capable he might be. The environmental challenges the world is facing cannot be addressed by one country, let alone by one man. At the same time, <u><strong><mark>an</mark> <mark>inspired US President</u></strong></mark> guided by competent people, <u><strong><mark>who does not shy away from</mark> exercising the true responsibilities and <mark>leadership</mark> his country is capable of, <mark>could</mark> do a lot to <mark>spur</mark> <mark>the</mark> <mark>international community into action</u></strong></mark>. To paraphrase one of his illustrious predecessors, “the world asks for action and action now.” What was true in President Roosevelt’s America 77 years ago is even more appropriate today. From IUCN’s perspective, the first signals are encouraging. The US has seriously begun to discuss constructive engagement in climate change debates. With Copenhagen a mere 11 months away, this commitment is long overdue and certainly very welcome. Many governments still worry that if they set tough standards to control carbon emissions, their industry and agriculture will become uncompetitive, a fear that leads to a foot-dragging “you go first” attitude that is blocking progress<u><strong>. A positive intervention by the United States could provide the vital catalyst that moves the basis of the present negotiations beyond the narrowly defined national interests that lie at the heart of the current impasse</u></strong>. <u><strong>The logjam in international negotiations on climate change should not be difficult to break if the US were to lead the industrialized countries to agree that much of their wealth has been acquired at the expense of the environment</u></strong> (in this case greenhouse gases emitted over the past two hundred years)<u><strong> and that with the some of the benefits that this wealth has brought, comes the obligation to deal with the problems that have resulted as side-effects</u></strong>. With equitable entitlement to the common resources of the planet, an agreement that is fair and acceptable to all nations should be easy enough to achieve. Caps on emissions and sharing of energy efficient technologies are simply in the interest of everyone, rich or poor. And both rich and poor must now be ready to adopt less destructive technologies – based on renewables, efficiency and sustainability – both as a goal with intrinsic merit and also as an example to others. But climate is not the only critical global environmental issue that this new administration will have to deal with. <u><strong><mark>Conservation of biodiversity, a crucial prerequisite for the wellbeing of all humanity</mark>, no less America, needs as much attention, and just as urgently</u></strong>. <u><strong>The United States’ self-interest in conserving living natural resources strongly converges with the global common good in every sphere: in the <mark>oceans</mark>, by arresting the precipitate decline of fish stocks and the alarming rise of <mark>acidification</mark>; on land, by <mark>regenerating</mark> the health of our <mark>soils, forests and rivers;</mark> and in the atmosphere by reducing the massive emission of pollutants from our wasteful industries, construction, agriculture and transport systems.</p></u></strong>",1NC,,1NC DA,224361,18,16975,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/BaSh/Baylor-Barron-Sheaff-Neg-UMKC-Round2.docx,564692,N,UMKC,2,Cal MS,Jake Justice,"1AC - Marijuana Prohibition is Racist

Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek’s point is rather that in rejecting economism we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the lives and destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In particular we should not overlook Marx’s central insight that in order to create a universal global system the forces of capitalism seek to conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that the gentrification of global liberal capitalism is one whose ‘universalism’ fundamentally reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast sectors of the world’s populations. In this way, neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place. Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least for the central capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal and its price in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to say, the human cost in terms of inherent global poverty and degraded ‘life-chances’ cannot be calculated within the existing economic rationale and, in consequence, social exclusion remains mystified and nameless (viz. the patronizing reference to the ‘developing world’). And Zizek’s point is that this mystification is magnified through capitalism’s profound capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation. Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.  Against this Zizek argues for a new universalism whose primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of social existence are founded on exclusion on a global scale.

Both studies underwent ethical scrutiny by senior colleagues before participant recruitment. The studies explored the influence of visual and iconic representations of climate change on people’s senses of engagement with the issue. As Lorenzoni et al. (2007) note, the use of largely qualitative methods in both studies reported here complements recent large-scale quantitative U.K. survey research by allowing participants the space to freely articulate their personal interpretations of climate change, leading to a rich and exploratory data source. It was not the central aim of either study to investigate the use of fear as a climate change communications tool. This article arose from a realization of the synergies that existed in the studies investigating public engagement with climate change and the critical role that fear messaging may play in engaging (or not) the public with climate change. When viewed together, results from both studies provide key evidence of the impact of using fear as a communication technique on people’s perceptions of climate change. Table 1 displays the methods used in the two studies. [CONTINUES] Participants in the focus groups disagreed strongly with using fear as a communications tool, instead, as previously discussed, citing examples of icons that engaged with people’s everyday life as key for inducing a sense of saliency. In addition to distancing the viewer from the issue, fear-inducing communication approaches were found to enhance a sense of fatalism and thus act to encourage disengagement with climate change rather than positive engagement. Participants in both studies generally felt that humans are largely causing climate change and that something should be done about it “before it’s too late.” Although the majority noted that there are things that people can do to reduce the causes of climate change however, many tended to note that their conceptions of climate change as a global and to some extent distant and future issue made individual actions akin to “a drop in the ocean,” unlikely to make any significant contribution in relation to the scale of the problem. Obviously, from a personal point of view you can walk, use the car less and things like that, and recycle stuff. . . . But on a more sort of wider scale then, I don’t think that the individual has got enough power to do a lot. (VisionS) People feel like they can’t do anything. And to be honest, it’s not going to really have a massive effect anyway. (VisionS) Although hoping that climate change would not affect them, three participants in the imagery study specifically noted that thinking about climate change made them feel so scared and depressed that they purposefully did not think about it. Fear appeals may act to increase this response, leading to denial of the problem and disengagement with the whole issue in an attempt to avoid the discomfort of contending with it. The Q-methodology results from the imagery study provide a clear insight into the use of fearful, emotive, or dramatic imagery and its impact on people’s engagement with climate change, specifically their personal senses of issue salience and self-efficacy. The Q-method output was in the form of sets of factors (e.g., McKeown & Thomas, 1988) that represented the most significant emerging points of view held by participants in relation to the pictures. The interpretation of the Q-sort factors, or viewpoints, was aided by reasoning provided by participants for their image rankings.

As Lorenzoni et al. (2007) note, <u><strong><mark>the</mark> use of largely <mark>qualitative methods</mark> in both studies reported <mark>here complements recent large-scale quantitative U.K. survey research</mark> by allowing participants the space to freely articulate their personal interpretations of climate change, <mark>leading to a rich</mark> and <mark>exploratory data source</u></strong>.</mark> It was not the central aim of either study to investigate the use of fear as a climate change communications tool. This article arose from a realization of the synergies that existed in the studies investigating public engagement with climate change and the critical role that fear messaging may play in engaging (or not) the public with climate change. When viewed together, <u><strong>results from both studies provide key evidence of the impact of using fear as a communication technique on people’s perceptions of climate change</u></strong><mark>.</mark> Table 1 displays the methods used in the two studies. [CONTINUES] Participants in the <u><strong>focus <mark>groups disagreed strongly with using fear as a communications tool</u></strong></mark>, instead, as previously discussed, citing examples of icons that engaged with people’s everyday life as key for inducing a sense of saliency. <u><strong><mark>In addition to distancing the viewer from the issue, fear-inducing communication</mark> approaches were found to <mark>enhance a</mark> <mark>sense of fatalism</mark> <mark>and</mark> thus act to <mark>encourage disengagement</mark> with climate change rather than positive engagement</u></strong>. <u><strong><mark>Participants</mark> in both studies generally <mark>felt</mark> that</u></strong> humans are largely causing climate change and that <u><strong><mark>something should be done</u></strong></mark> about it “before it’s too late.” <u><strong>Although the majority noted that there are things that people can do to reduce the causes of climate change however, <mark>many tended to note that their</mark> <mark>conceptions of climate change as a global</mark> and to some extent distant and future <mark>issue made individual</mark> <mark>actions akin to “a drop in the ocean</mark>,” unlikely to make any significant contribution in relation to the scale of the problem.</u></strong> Obviously, from a personal point of view you can walk, use the car less and things like that, and recycle stuff. . . . But on a more sort of wider scale then, I don’t think that the individual has got enough power to do a lot. (VisionS) <u><strong>People feel like they can’t do anything.</u></strong> And to be honest, it’s not going to really have a massive effect anyway. (VisionS) Although hoping that climate change would not affect them, three participants in the imagery study specifically noted that <u><strong><mark>thinking about climate change made</mark> <mark>them</mark> feel <mark>so scared and depressed</mark> that <mark>they purposefully did not think about it</u></strong>.</mark> <u><strong><mark>Fear appeals</u></strong></mark> may act to <u><strong><mark>increase</mark> <mark>this response</u></strong>, <u><strong>leading to denial of the problem</mark> and disengagement with the whole issue in an attempt to avoid the discomfort of contending with it.</u></strong> The Q-methodology results from the imagery study provide a clear insight into the use of fearful, emotive, or dramatic imagery and its impact on people’s engagement with climate change, specifically their personal senses of issue salience and self-efficacy. The Q-method output was in the form of sets of factors (e.g., McKeown & Thomas, 1988) that represented the most significant emerging points of view held by participants in relation to the pictures. The interpretation of the Q-sort factors, or viewpoints, was aided by reasoning provided by participants for their image rankings.

A positive intervention by the United States could provide the vital catalyst that moves the basis of the present negotiations beyond the narrowly defined national interests that lie at the heart of the current impasse The logjam in international negotiations on climate change should not be difficult to break if the US were to lead the industrialized countries to agree that much of their wealth has been acquired at the expense of the environment  and that with the some of the benefits that this wealth has brought, comes the obligation to deal with the problems that have resulted as side-effects Conservation of biodiversity, a crucial prerequisite for the wellbeing of all humanity, no less America, needs as much attention, and just as urgently The United States’ self-interest in conserving living natural resources strongly converges with the global common good in every sphere: in the oceans, by arresting the precipitate decline of fish stocks and the alarming rise of acidification; on land, by regenerating the health of our soils, forests and rivers; and in the atmosphere by reducing the massive emission of pollutants from our wasteful industries, construction, agriculture and transport systems.","the United States will become an active leader in international efforts to address threats confronting civilization and the survival of the human species.

This extraordinary change in regime brings with it the promise of a deep change in attitudes and aspirations of Americans, a change that will lead, hopefully, to new directions in their nation’s policies and action. In particular, we can hope that from being a very reluctant partner in global discussions, especially on issues relating to environment and sustainable development, the United States will become an active leader in international efforts to address the Millennial threats now confronting civilization and even the survival of the human species. For the conservation of biodiversity, so essential to maintaining life on Earth, this promise of change has come not a moment too soon. It would be a mistake to put all of our hopes on the shoulder of one young man, however capable he might be. The environmental challenges the world is facing cannot be addressed by one country, let alone by one man. At the same time, an inspired US President guided by competent people, who does not shy away from exercising the true responsibilities and leadership his country is capable of, could do a lot to spur the international community into action. To paraphrase one of his illustrious predecessors, “the world asks for action and action now.” What was true in President Roosevelt’s America 77 years ago is even more appropriate today. From IUCN’s perspective, the first signals are encouraging. The US has seriously begun to discuss constructive engagement in climate change debates. With Copenhagen a mere 11 months away, this commitment is long overdue and certainly very welcome. Many governments still worry that if they set tough standards to control carbon emissions, their industry and agriculture will become uncompetitive, a fear that leads to a foot-dragging “you go first” attitude that is blocking progress. A positive intervention by the United States could provide the vital catalyst that moves the basis of the present negotiations beyond the narrowly defined national interests that lie at the heart of the current impasse. The logjam in international negotiations on climate change should not be difficult to break if the US were to lead the industrialized countries to agree that much of their wealth has been acquired at the expense of the environment (in this case greenhouse gases emitted over the past two hundred years) and that with the some of the benefits that this wealth has brought, comes the obligation to deal with the problems that have resulted as side-effects. With equitable entitlement to the common resources of the planet, an agreement that is fair and acceptable to all nations should be easy enough to achieve. Caps on emissions and sharing of energy efficient technologies are simply in the interest of everyone, rich or poor. And both rich and poor must now be ready to adopt less destructive technologies – based on renewables, efficiency and sustainability – both as a goal with intrinsic merit and also as an example to others. But climate is not the only critical global environmental issue that this new administration will have to deal with. Conservation of biodiversity, a crucial prerequisite for the wellbeing of all humanity, no less America, needs as much attention, and just as urgently. The United States’ self-interest in conserving living natural resources strongly converges with the global common good in every sphere: in the oceans, by arresting the precipitate decline of fish stocks and the alarming rise of acidification; on land, by regenerating the health of our soils, forests and rivers; and in the atmosphere by reducing the massive emission of pollutants from our wasteful industries, construction, agriculture and transport systems.",4016.0,"<h4>That’s key to solve warming</h4><p><u><strong>Khosla 9</u></strong>,<Ashok, IUCN President, International Union for Conservation of Nature, A new President for the United States: We have a dream, 1-29-09, <u>http://cms.iucn.org/news_events/?uNewsID=2595</p><p>A rejuvenated America, with a renewed purpose, commitment and energy to make its contribution once again towards a better world could well be the turning point that can reverse the current decline in</u> the state of the global economy, <u>the health of its life support systems</u> and the morale of people everywhere.

The stakes here are high. These dissenting scholars and the knowledges they produce are constructed by right-wing critics as a threat to U.S. power and global hegemony, as has been the case in earlier moments in U.S. history, particularly during the Cold War. Much discussion of incidents where academics have been denied tenure or publicly attacked for their critique of U.S. foreign or domestic policies, as in earlier moments, has centered on the important question of academic freedom. However, the chapters in this book break new ground by demonstrating that what is really at work in these attacks are the logics of racism, warfare, and nationalism that undergird U.S. imperialism and also the architecture of the U.S. academy. Our argument here is that these logics shape a systemic structure of repression of academic knowledge that counters the imperial, nation-building project.
The premise of this book is that the U.S. academy is an “imperial university.” As in all imperial and colonial nations, intellectuals and scholarship play an important role—directly or indirectly, willingly or unwittingly—in legitimizing American exceptionalism and rationalizing U.S. expansionism and repression, domestically and globally. The title of this book, then, is not a rhetorical flourish but offers a concept that is grounded in the particular imperial formation of the United States, one that is in many ways ambiguous and shape-shifting. 3 It is important to note that U.S. imperialism is characterized by deterritorialized, flexible, and covert practices of subjugation and violence and as such does not resemble historical forms of European colonialism that depended on territorial colonialism.4 As a settler-colonial nation, it has over time developed various strategies of control that include proxy wars, secret interventions, and client regimes aimed at maintaining its political, economic, and military dominance around the globe, as well as cultural interventions and “soft power.” The chapters here help to illuminate and historicize the role of the U.S. university in legitimizing notions of Manifest Destiny and foundational mythologies of settler colonialism and exceptional democracy as well as the attempts by scholars and students to challenge and subvert them.
This book demonstrates the ways in which the academy’s role in supporting state policies is crucial, even—and especially—as a presumably liberal institution. Indeed, it is precisely the support of a liberal class that is always critical for the maintenance of “benevolent empire.”5 As U.S. military and overseas interventions are increasingly framed as humanitarian wars—to save oppressed others and rescue victimized women—it is liberal ideologies of gender, sexuality, religion, pluralism, and democracy that are key to uphold.6 The university is a key battleground in these culture wars and in producing as well as contesting knowledges about the state of the nation.
We argue that the state of permanent war that is core to U.S. imperialism and racial statecraft has three fronts: military, cultural, and academic. Our conceptualization of the imperial university links these fronts of war, for the academic battleground is part of the culture wars that emerge in a militarized nation, one that is always presumably under threat, externally or internally. Debates about national identity and national culture shape the battles over academic freedom and the role of the university in defining the racial boundaries of the nation and its “proper” subjects and “proper” politics.

740733,Causes extinction through global civil war,Duffield 8,"Duffield 8 (Mark Duffield, emeritus professor of politics at the University of Bristol, 2008, “Global Civil War: The Non-Insured, International Containment and Post-Interventionary Society,” Journal of Refugee Studies Volume 21 Issue 2)","you cannot have development or security without containing the circulation of underdeveloped life the origins of this nexus can be traced to decolonization decolonization publicly signalled the generic division of humankind into insured and non-insured species-life. It foregrounded the coexistence of a developed life, supported by the welfare bureaucracies associated with social insurance, with an underdeveloped life expected to be self-reliant decolonization also called forth a volatile world of peoples having, for the first time, the potential to circulate globally containment has deepened and extended to constitute a virtual global ban on the free movement of spontaneous or non-managed migration Spurred by the threat of terrorism, such concerns have now been generalized to include the critical energy, transport and service infrastructures of mass consumer society.
The international security architecture that emerged with decolonization interconnects the containment of irregular migration with measures to integrate migrant communities already settled within consumer society and, at the same time, state-led development initiatives to improve the self-reliance and stasis of underdeveloped life in situ.

Rather than emerging with the end of the Cold War, or even less convincingly with 9/11, the origins of this nexus can be traced to decolonization. While its constituent parts have an even longer history, decolonization publicly signalled the generic division of humankind into insured and non-insured species-life.

As an appendage of this new world of states, decolonization also called forth a volatile world of peoples having, for the first time, the potential to circulate globally. In meeting this threat, since the 1960s, the resilience of consumer society has been regularly scored in terms of the ability of effective states to contain the circulatory effects of the permanent crisis of self-reliance, including political instability and the mobile poverty of irregular migration. In the intervening decades, containment has deepened and extended to constitute a virtual global ban on the free movement of spontaneous or non-managed migration. This necessity was first articulated in terms of the risks posed to community cohesion and the finite resources of the welfare state. Spurred by the threat of terrorism, such concerns have now been generalized to include the critical energy, transport and service infrastructures of mass consumer society.
The international security architecture that emerged with decolonization interconnects the containment of irregular migration with measures to integrate migrant communities already settled within consumer society and, at the same time, state-led development initiatives to improve the self-reliance and stasis of underdeveloped life in situ.

One year later, Charles Krauthammer emphasized in ""The Unipolar Moment"" that the United States had emerged from the Cold War as by far the most powerful country on the planet.2 He urged American leaders not to be reticent about using that power ""to lead a unipolar world, unashamedly laying down the rules of world order and being prepared to enforce them."" Krauthammer's advice fit neatly with Fukuyama's vision of the future: the United States should take the lead in bringing democracy to less developed countries the world over. After all, that shouldn't be an especially difficult task given that America had awesome power and the cunning of history on its side.  U.S. grand strategy has followed this basic prescription for the past twenty years, mainly because most policy makers inside the Beltway have agreed with the thrust of Fukuyama's and Krauthammer's early analyses.  The results, however, have been disastrous. The United States has been at war for a startling two out of every three years since 1989, and there is no end in sight. As anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of world events knows, countries that continuously fight wars invariably build powerful national-security bureaucracies that undermine civil liberties and make it difficult to hold leaders accountable for their behavior; and they invariably end up adopting ruthless policies normally associated with brutal dictators. The Founding Fathers understood this problem, as is clear from James Madison's observation that ""no nation can preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare."" Washington's pursuit of policies like assassination, rendition and torture over the past decade, not to mention the weakening of the rule of law at home, shows that their fears were justified.  To make matters worse, the United States is now engaged in protracted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq that have so far cost well over a trillion dollars and resulted in around forty-seven thousand American casualties. The pain and suffering inflicted on Iraq has been enormous. Since the war began in March 2003, more than one hundred thousand Iraqi civilians have been killed, roughly 2 million Iraqis have left the country and 1.7 million more have been internally displaced. Moreover, the American military is not going to win either one of these conflicts, despite all the phony talk about how the ""surge"" has worked in Iraq and how a similar strategy can produce another miracle in Afghanistan. We may well be stuck in both quagmires for years to come, in fruitless pursuit of victory.  The United States has also been unable to solve three other major foreign-policy problems. Washington has worked overtime-with no success-to shut down Iran's uranium-enrichment capability for fear that it might lead to Tehran acquiring nuclear weapons. And the United States, unable to prevent North Korea from acquiring nuclear weapons in the first place, now seems incapable of compelling Pyongyang to give them up. Finally, every post-Cold War administration has tried and failed to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict; all indicators are that this problem will deteriorate further as the West Bank and Gaza are incorporated into a Greater Israel.  The unpleasant truth is that the United States is in a world of trouble today on the foreign-policy front, and this state of affairs is only likely to get worse in the next few years, as Afghanistan and Iraq unravel and the blame game escalates to poisonous levels. Thus, it is hardly surprising that a recent Chicago Council on Global Affairs survey found that ""looking forward 50 years, only 33 percent of Americans think the United States will continue to be the world's leading power.""

The Madoff settlement suggests, strongly, that the answer is yes. say goodbye to financial privacy","“JPMORGAN as an institution failed and failed miserably,” said Preet Bharara, New York’s federal attorney, when explaining earlier this week a $1.7 billion settlement in the case of the bank’s failure to detect horrendous fraud of Bernard Madoff (pictured). A more intellectually honest announcement might have included indignation about the various government enforcement agencies which were explicitly and repeatedly warned of Mr Madoff’s scam by, among others, another major bank—and then utterly blew inspections without any individual or entity facing censure. A consequence of the Madoff case will be that all banks will need to be far tougher on their clients—and not just crooks. The 40 plus pages released along with the settlement do not make for easy reading, but the government’s case is built around two components. One is the relationship of Mr Madoff with JPMorgan Chase’s investment office in London. At times it invested with Mr Madoff through “feeder” funds, but never directly. It ultimately developed concerns about how these generated returns, and alerted British authorities. Less well known, JPMorgan’s primary relationship with Mr Madoff in America was two large checking accounts. Which raises the question whether, because of these checking accounts, JPMorgan had an obligation to alert American authorities as well? In agreeing to the settlement, JPMorgan has said it should have—though it was not in a position to argue (the simple issuance of a criminal indictment would have been devastating, regardless of whether it succeeded in court). The government’s case rests on the notion that America’s Bank Secrecy Act requires reporting anything that could have “a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax or regulatory investigations.” Given the expansiveness of America’s laws, that could be almost anything. The government’s information document cites the report sent to British authorities, which says that “the investment performance achieved…appear to be too good to be true—meaning that it probably is.” If that is the standard, American regulatory agencies should be prepared for an electronic tsunami of alerts. There is, apparently, no penalty for over-reporting. The government statement is scathing about JPMorgan’s misunderstanding of Mr Madoff’s business. Banks are required to know their customers, but to what extent? Successful investment-management firms are often secretive about their approach, and rightly so: it is, after all, their secret sauce. Most businesses are complex. Should a checking account in America mean a company must spill all, or even that a bank must know all? The Madoff settlement suggests, strongly, that the answer is yes. So say goodbye to financial privacy. The government will see all. There could be lots of other consequences. Beyond adding armies to monitor transactions and pass them on to regulators, banks will start firing clients because they happen to do business in newly suspect categories. The reasons may not be explained. They may not even be understood by the bank employee relaying the news to the fired customer. Among them will be pursuing business activities abroad in places thought to have activities that violate American law. Or it could be because of a relationship with a politician (making a bank liable to accusations of politically-induced lending) or because of employment with a government of a country that is accused of money laundering. The Madoff settlement will be just one reason for this worrying trend, but it is an important one. The payment of a $1.7 billion for having a toxic client will mean the imposition of rules everywhere. And because they are rules, they won’t merely cover toxic clients. For non-crooks, these will seem arbitrary. Banks will become less like an efficient coffee shop competing with new products and more like airports, with oppressive security.

740975,Our affirmation of PAS is an epistemological askesis: a renunciation of responsibility over the idols of life and health as modernity has construed them – only this approach prevents the deployment of life as religiosity to subdue bodies into regimes of managerialism,Cayley 92,Cayley 92,", 1992 SJE
Responsibility was a word that acquired connotations that had made it¶ into the opposite of self-limitation. How could he be responsible, he¶ asked, when health now implies “the smooth integration of my immune system into a socioeconomic world system” and¶ responsibility “an interiorization of global systems into the self I can imagine no complex of controls capable of saving us¶ from the flood of poisons, radiations, goods and services¶ which sicken humans and animals more than ever before.¶ There is no way out of this world. “Responsibility” is now an illusion. In such¶ a world, “being healthy” is reduced to a combination of¶ techniques As an alternative to responsibility, Illich proposed renunciation. courageous, disciplined, self-critical¶ renunciation accomplished in community I will call it askesis not mortification but “epistemological askesis,” a purge of  those corrupting concepts that give “fictitious substances” the  semblance of a sensible existence. he was imposing a painful¶ proscription only by refraining from those modes of¶ speech and action that disguise their own powerlessness can people¶ recover a sense of the surprising power of this moment, this place, this¶ person. Responsibility for health is a way of¶ warding off evil that domesticates it Life is the master concept of “a new stage of religiosity,” the primum mobile in fictitious substances Life is used as a substantive when¶ people speak of life on earth, or the appearance of a new life at¶ conception.

In a passage in Gender about Raymond Williams’s book Key¶ Words, Illich comments that “each entry conveys the surprise and¶ passion of an aging man telling us about the inconstancy of a word on¶ which his own integrity has rested.”103 Illich has known the same¶ experience. Responsibility was a word that carried considerable weight¶ in his writings until at least the time of Medical Nemesis; but, in 1990,¶ in a lecture given in Hannover, Germany, entitled “Health as One’s¶ Own Responsibility: No Thank You!,” he renounced it. In this talk he¶ argued that the word had now acquired connotations that had made it¶ into the opposite of self-limitation. How could he be responsible, he¶ asked, when health now implies “the smooth integration of my immune system into a socioeconomic world system” and¶ responsibility “an interiorization of global systems into the self, in the¶ manner of a categorical imperative.” “In a world which worships an¶ ontology of systems,” he went on, “ethical responsibility is reduced to¶ a legitimizing formality.”¶ I can imagine no complex of controls capable of saving us¶ from the flood of poisons, radiations, goods and services¶ which sicken humans and animals more than ever before.¶ There is no way out of this world. I live in a manufactured¶ reality ever further removed from creation. And I know today ¶ what that signifies, what horror threatens each of us. A few¶ decades ago, I did not yet know it. At that time, it seemed¶ possible that I could share responsibility for the re-making of¶ this manufactured world. Today, I finally know what¶ powerlessness is. “Responsibility” is now an illusion. In such¶ a world, “being healthy” is reduced to a combination of¶ techniques, protection of the environment, and adaptation to¶ the consequences of techniques, all three of which are,¶ inevitably, privileges.¶ As an alternative to responsibility, Illich proposed renunciation.¶ “We no longer have a word for courageous, disciplined, self-critical¶ renunciation accomplished in community — but that is what I am¶ talking about. I will call it askesis.” He specified that he did not mean¶ mortification but rather an “epistemological askesis,” a purge of¶ those corrupting concepts that give “fictitious substances” the¶ semblance of a sensible existence.¶ Illich did not hide the fact that he was imposing a painful¶ proscription, but he argued that only by refraining from those modes of¶ speech and action that disguise their own powerlessness can people¶ recover a sense of the surprising power of this moment, this place, this¶ person. Responsibility for health is what he calls a rain dance: a way of¶ warding off evil that at the same time domesticates it by making it¶ appear to be in the dancer’s power. Evil, for Illich, is not manageable;¶ and such things as nuclear weapons, genetic manipulation, and the¶ chemical transformation of earth and atmosphere by industrial poisons ¶ are evils, not problems. “We can suffer such evil,” he says. “We can¶ be broken by it, but we cannot make sense of it, cannot direct it.”¶ At the end of “Health as One’s Own Responsibility: No Thank¶ You!” Illich takes up the question of “life” that occupies the last¶ chapter of this book. Life, in Illich’s view, is the master concept of¶ what he calls “a new stage of religiosity,”04 the primum mobile in the¶ empyrean of fictitious substances. Two years before, he had shocked a¶ convocation of Lutheran bishops by pronouncing a solemn curse on¶ the use of this word as substantive. Life is used as a substantive when¶ people speak of life on earth, or the appearance of a new life at¶ conception. Doctors who claim responsibility for the lives of their¶ patients, and bioethicists who asses the quality of those lives, speak in¶ the same sense.

The premise of this book is that the U.S. academy is an “imperial university.” As in all imperial and colonial nations, intellectuals and scholarship play an important role—directly or indirectly, willingly or unwittingly—in legitimizing American exceptionalism and rationalizing U.S. expansionism and repression, domestically and globally. The title of this book, then, is not a rhetorical flourish but offers a concept that is grounded in the particular imperial formation of the United States, one that is in many ways ambiguous and shape-shifting. 3 It is important to note that U.S. imperialism is characterized by deterritorialized, flexible, and covert practices of subjugation and violence and as such does not resemble historical forms of European colonialism that depended on territorial colonialism.4 As a settler-colonial nation, it has over time developed various strategies of control that include proxy wars, secret interventions, and client regimes aimed at maintaining its political, economic, and military dominance around the globe, as well as cultural interventions and “soft power.” The chapters here help to illuminate and historicize the role of the U.S. university in legitimizing notions of Manifest Destiny and foundational mythologies of settler colonialism and exceptional democracy as well as the attempts by scholars and students to challenge and subvert them.
This book demonstrates the ways in which the academy’s role in supporting state policies is crucial, even—and especially—as a presumably liberal institution. Indeed, it is precisely the support of a liberal class that is always critical for the maintenance of “benevolent empire.”5 As U.S. military and overseas interventions are increasingly framed as humanitarian wars—to save oppressed others and rescue victimized women—it is liberal ideologies of gender, sexuality, religion, pluralism, and democracy that are key to uphold.6 The university is a key battleground in these culture wars and in producing as well as contesting knowledges about the state of the nation.

A reasonable mission statement for any health professional is that we strive to improve the quality and length of our patients’ lives; nonetheless, death remains the inevitable end of that journey. In an age of unprecedented openness and access to information, where everything from sex to mental illness is discussed with candour unthinkable to our forbears, my personal experience is that the societal taboo around death has worsened. Furthermore, the medical profession has colluded with this, with the end result being a disservice to the dying and their families.¶ The Liverpool Care Pathway was introduced with the hope of bringing hospice-level palliative care to all clinical settings. Following a recent independent review,1 it was brusquely dropped, yet the review itself encapsulated the reluctance to accept death.2 An ethos that equates the reasonable switch to palliation in negative, even pejorative terms, such as not trying, giving up, or ‘allowing people to die’ puts unreasonable pressure on the medical profession and may damage relationships with patients, relatives, and other healthcare colleagues, but is rife. Nursing homes have the highest concentration of ill people outside acute hospital settings, yet in the face of precipitous physical and cognitive decline I rarely hear relatives acknowledge this, and the discourse invariably centres on cure. One consequence of this is extraordinarily high calls not only on primary care but on hospitals, often from nursing staff under duress from relatives demanding that ‘something be done’.¶ Our profession is, however, culpable in its own way by appearing omnipotent, and our lexicon reflects this. Screening, early detection, and disease prevention is the language of absolutes in an occupation dominated by marginal, considered decisions. Nothing rings more curative than having radical surgery, yet we have all seen men die from prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy, only later than if they had no treatment. Similarly, revascularisation may give people years, possibly decades of additional life before eventual death from heart failure or other vascular disease ensues — surely a success story. Exactly four decades ago, however, Ivan Illich argued in his book Medical Nemesis3 that our profession faced a reputational fall if admirable scientific progress was not matched by honesty about limitations, and I fear his prophesy is correct. I aver that we mislead not through malice, but by an institutional reticence about poor prognosis diagnoses, as well as about when the end is nigh. How often do we receive a clinic discharge concluding with a review date wildly optimistic for the patient’s likely life expectancy?¶ I believe that we need a cultural change to more open discussion about death and, crucially, the experience of dying, beginning with the undergraduate curriculum where death is scarcely mentioned beyond cold mortality statistics. Our much-touted patient-centredness must embrace the notion that death can be our friend, the ultimate relief from the suffering and disability frequently borne, with the ageing population, for many years.4 Supporting patients in end-of-life care is just as much our duty: indeed, an unintended consequence of a culture that always seeks cure, and fears discussion and planning of death, is that far too few deaths occur at home, instead taking place in hospital with interventions that are both expensive and futile.5 GPs, supported by our district and Macmillan nurse colleagues, could reasonably help more people to die the good death at home, surrounded by loved ones.

The amount of cannabis seized by U.S. federal, state and local officers along the boundary with Mexico has fallen 37 percent since 2011, a period during which American marijuana consumers have increasingly turned to the more potent, higher-grade domestic varieties cultivated under legal and quasi-legal protections in more than two dozen U.S. states. Made-in-the-USA marijuana is quickly displacing the cheap, seedy, hard-packed version harvested by the bushel in Mexico’s Sierra Madre mountains. That has prompted Mexican drug farmers to plant more opium poppies, and the sticky brown and black “tar” heroin they produce is channeled by traffickers into the U.S. communities hit hardest by prescription painkiller abuse, off­ering addicts a $10 alternative to $80-a-pill oxycodone. “Legalization of marijuana for recreational use has given U.S. consumers access to high-quality marijuana, with genetically improved strains, grown in greenhouses,” said Raul Benitez-Manaut, a drug-war expert at Mexico’s National Autonomous University. “That’s why the Mexican cartels are switching to heroin and meth.” U.S. law enforcement agents seized 2,181 kilograms of heroin last year coming from Mexico, nearly three times the amount confiscated in 2009. Methamphetamine, too, has surged, mocking the Hollywood image of backwoods bayou labs and “Breaking Bad” chemists. The reality, according to Drug Enforcement Administration figures, is that 90 percent of the meth on U.S. streets is cooked in Mexico, where precursor chemicals are far easier to obtain. “The days of the large-scale U.S. meth labs are pretty much gone, given how much the Mexicans have taken over production south of the border and distribution into the United States,” said Lawrence Payne, a DEA spokesman. “Their product is far superior, cheaper and more pure.” Last year, 15,803 kilograms of the drug was seized along the border, up from 3,076 kilos in 2009. “Criminal organizations are no longer going for bulk marijuana,” said Sidney Aki, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection port director here at the agency’s busiest crossing for pedestrians and passenger vehicles, just south of San Diego. “Hard drugs are the growing trend, and they’re profitable in small amounts.” Voters in the District of Columbia and 23 U.S. states have approved marijuana for recreational or medical use, with Colorado, Washington state, Alaska and Oregon opting for full legalization. Estimates of the size of America’s marijuana harvest vary widely, and DEA officials say they do not know how quickly it may be increasing as a result of decriminalization. Mexican cartels continue to deploy people as “mules” strapped with 50-pound marijuana backpacks to hike through the Arizona borderlands and send commercial trucks into Texas with bales of shrink-wrapped cannabis so big they need to be taken out on a forklift.

741185,We have an A-Priori ethical obligation to reject the violence of global capitalism.,Zizek and Daly 04,"Zizek and Daly 04

Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek’s point is rather that in rejecting economism we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the lives and destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In particular we should not overlook Marx’s central insight that in order to create a universal global system the forces of capitalism seek to conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a kind of gentrification of that system. What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that the gentrification of global liberal capitalism is one whose ‘universalism’ fundamentally reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast sectors of the world’s populations. In this way, neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes of winning and losing as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place. Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least for the central capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal and its price in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to say, the human cost in terms of inherent global poverty and degraded ‘life-chances’ cannot be calculated within the existing economic rationale and, in consequence, social exclusion remains mystified and nameless (viz. the patronizing reference to the ‘developing world’). And Zizek’s point is that this mystification is magnified through capitalism’s profound capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect (or misdirect) social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation. Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.  Against this Zizek argues for a new universalism whose primary ethical directive is to confront the fact that our forms of social existence are founded on exclusion on a global scale. While it is perfectly true that universalism can never become Universal (it will always require a hegemonic-particular embodiment in order to have any meaning), what is novel about Zizek’s universalism is that it would not attempt to conceal this fact or reduce the status of the abject Other to that of a ‘glitch’ in an otherwise sound matrix.",4041.0,"<h4><u><strong>We have an A-Priori ethical obligation to reject the violence of global capitalism. </h4><p>Zizek and Daly 04 </p><p></u></strong>[Slavoj Zizek and Glyn Daly, Conversations with Zizek, 2004, p. 14-16]</p><p>For Zizek it is imperative that we cut through this Gordian knot of postmodern protocol and recognize that <u><mark>our ethico-political responsibility is to confront the</mark> constitutive <mark>violence of today’s global capitalism and its obscene naturalization</mark> / anonymization <mark>of the millions who are subjugated by it throughout the world.</u></mark> Against the standardized positions of postmodern culture – with all its pieties concerning ‘multiculturalist’ etiquette – Zizek is arguing for a politics that might be called ‘radically incorrect’ in the sense that it break with these types of positions 7 and focuses instead on the very organizing principles of today’s social reality: the principles of global liberal capitalism. This requires some care and subtlety. For far too long, Marxism has been bedeviled by an almost fetishistic economism that has tended towards political morbidity. With the likes of Hilferding and Gramsci, and more recently Laclau and Mouffee, crucial theoretical advances have been made that enable the transcendence of all forms of economism. In this new context, however, Zizek argues that the problem that now presents itself is almost that of the opposite fetish. That is to say, the prohibitive anxieties surrounding the taboo of economism can function as a way of not engaging with economic reality and as a way of implicitly accepting the latter as a basic horizon of existence. In an ironic Freudian-Lacanian twist, the fear of economism can end up reinforcing a de facto economic necessity in respect of contemporary capitalism (i.e. the initial prohibition conjures up the very thing it fears). This is not to endorse any kind of retrograde return to economism. Zizek’s point is rather that in rejecting economism we should not lose sight of the systemic power of capital in shaping the lives and destinies of humanity and our very sense of the possible. In particular we should not overlook Marx’s central insight that <u><mark>in order to create a universal</mark> global <mark>system the forces of capitalism seek to conceal the politico-discursive violence of its construction through a</mark> kind of <mark>gentrification of that system.</mark> </u>What is persistently denied by neo-liberals such as Rorty (1989) and Fukuyama (1992) is that <u><mark>the gentrification of global liberal capitalism</u></mark> is one whose ‘universalism’ <u>fundamentally <mark>reproduces and depends upon a disavowed violence that excludes vast sectors of the world’s populations.</u></mark> In this way, <u><mark>neo-liberal ideology attempts to naturalize capitalism by presenting its outcomes</mark> of winning and losing <mark>as if they were simply a matter of chance and sound judgment in a neutral market place.</mark> </u>Capitalism does indeed create a space for a certain diversity, at least for the central capitalist regions, but it is neither neutral nor ideal and its price in terms of social exclusion is exorbitant. That is to say, <u><mark>the human cost in terms of inherent global poverty and degraded ‘life-chances’ cannot be calculated within the existing economic rationale and</mark>,</u> in consequence, <u><mark>social exclusion remains mystified and nameless</u></mark> (viz. the patronizing reference to the ‘developing world’). And Zizek’s point is that <u><mark>this mystification is magnified through capitalism’s profound capacity to ingest its own excesses and negativity: to redirect</u></mark> (or misdirect) <u><mark>social antagonisms and to absorb them within a culture of differential affirmation.</u></mark> Instead of Bolshevism, the tendency today is towards a kind of political boutiquism that is readily sustained by postmodern forms of consumerism and lifestyle.

In this recent case of popular health  scare, as with many other instances of spreading epidemics over the past decade  (SARS, the H5N1 ‘‘bird flu,’’ but also AIDS before), individuals and groups are  asked to be the first layers of securitization by turning their bodies (or those of  family members, neighbors, coworkers, etc.) into primordial sites of analysis and  scrutiny from where not only the disease but, just as importantly, the fear about  what might happen with the disease will be monitored. With the ‘‘swine flu,’’ a  constant questioning of one’s body movements and symptomatic features, but  also of one’s daily habits, becomes an automatic (and autoimmune) measure  against the endemic fear. Individual and collective bodies become the most vital  dispositifs of containment of the pandemic and of the terror that inevitably will  spread. This management or governance of the ‘‘swine flu’’ and its scare (the  disease and its terror are inseparable from the moment a pandemic discourse is  launched) is said to require constant self-checking (Do I have a fever? Is my  cough a sign that I have been infected? Did I remember to wash my hands after  riding the bus or the subway?). But it also demands what can be called selfcarceralization  measures (we must stay home for several days if we feel sick; we  must wear protective masks if we venture outside and have a runny nose; we  must close entire schools for as long as necessary if we suspect that children  in the community have the flu). In the end, it is a full-blown biopolitics of selfterror  that sets in whereby people must allow themselves to be quarantined, must  accept being placed in hospital isolation, and must even be willing not to be  treated if pharmaceutical companies fail to produce enough vaccines for everyone.  As the A⁄H1N1 pandemic preemption regime reveals, individual and collective  bodies must always be prepared to immerse themselves into disciplinary and  regulatory procedures, into security mechanisms, and into governmental tactics.  In fact, they must act as dispositifs of fear governance themselves. This means that  bodies become the required lines of forces that connect the possible localized  symptoms to the global pandemic and its terror.  From this perspective on how bodies in societies of unease enable regimes  of biopolitical terror and are themselves the product of operations of governmentalized  fear, no return to a centralized model of power is necessary to  make sense of the terror embedded in contemporary regimes of government.  Rather, as the ‘‘swine flu’’ case shows, it is the horizontality, the capillarity,  and the propagation of carceral effects across space and through time that  authenticates this (self) imposition of governmental power and force.

There is a failure to distinguish between the very different types of social movements that have been studied.26 What is missing is a concern with what I propose to call the 'hegemonic capacity' of social movements. In a first approximation the distinction can be drawn between 'single issue' movements and those whose goals would constitute a wider set of social changes than their immediate objectives. But this approximation requires further refinement because some movements which are apparently single issue have extensive ramifications. The abortion rights movement, whilst superficially focusing on a single issue, has ramifications extending beyond the immediate question of women's right to control their fertility. The abortion rights movement is a prime example of the concept of 'local hegemony'. Such a movement is not directed to the kind of global hegemony that Gramsci had in mind with his focus on the role of the revolutionary party. But movements directed towards local (or regional) hegemony can only be adequately judged in their capacity to transform a wide range of social practices and discourses. For present purposes I suggest that, in addition, the environmental movement and the civil rights movement also serve as my example of movements of 'local hegemony' in that while focused on a set of specific demands, their realization would both necessitate and occasion wider structural changes. The most immediate implication is that their 'success' is not a matter of securing some immediate interest. It follows that to evaluate the role of litigation for such movements necessitates that focus be directed to the articulation between the elements that make up the strategic project of the movement. My suggestion is that a key feature of any such assessment revolves around their capacity to put in place a new or transformed discourse of rights which goes to the heart of the way in which the substantive issues are conceived, expressed, argued about, and struggled over. My more controversial suggestion is that the immediate 'success' or 'failure' of specific litigation has to be approached in a different way which requires that we take account of the possibility that litigation 'failure' may, paradoxically, provide the conditions of 'success' that compel a movement forward. In current struggles over wife abuse, all those cases in which judges impose derisory sanctions are contexts which drive the movement forward because they provide instances of a dying discourse in which women 'deserve' chastisement by their husbands. Such judicial pronouncements become more self-evidently anachronistic and in this inverted form speak of a new and emergent discourse of rights and autonomy. The implications of this line of thought are that the whole question of the success or failure of litigation and its connection with transformative strategies is far more complex than our existing attempts to measure 'success' and 'failure' admit. A more far-reaching criticism of litigation is that, rather than helping, 'law', conceived variously as litigation or legal reform politics, is itself part of the problem. This line of argument is at the root of Kristin Bumiller's study of the civil rights movement.27 This strand of the anti-rights critique is, I want to suggest, even if unintended, a form of 'Leftism' whose inescapable error lies in the fact that it imagines a terrain of struggle in which a social movement can, by an act of will, step outside the terrain on which the struggle is constituted, Here a hegemonic strategy must insist that it is precisely in the engagement with the actually existing terrain, in particular, with its discursive forms, that the possibility of their transformation and transcendence becomes possible. To refuse this terrain is, in general, Leftist because is marks a refusal to engage with the conditions within which social change is grounded.",4092.0,"<h4>Single issue focus spills over and is distinct from the ideologies that determine its use – just because we’ve isolated one problem doesn’t mean we legitimize the broader system</h4><p>Alan <strong>Hunt 90</strong>, Professor of Law and Sociology, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada, “Rights and Social Movements: Counter-Hegemon Strategies,” Journal of Law and Society Vol. 17 No. 3</p><p>Beyond questions concerning the criteria of 'success' there is another and perhaps more fundamental problem with the existing studies of the use of litigation by social movements. <u>There is a failure to distinguish between the very different types of social movements that have been studied</u>.26 What is missing is a concern with what I propose to call the 'hegemonic capacity' of social movements.

To cast some light on these strange remarks it is paramount to first explain what is meant here by discontinuity. One way of ascertaining its meaning for Bataille is by looking at the interiority of individual existence, in particular the existence of a being who is aware of that existence objectively.27 First, it can be said that the creation and conservation of interiority is inseparable from the movement of repulsion that was discussed in the previous section. Taboos are the socializing articulations of passionate loathing which cannot be disjoined from the individual’s attempt to ward off danger, violence, or anything reminiscent of life out of control. Taboos therefore reinforce a sense of interiority on the part of the subject who removes herself, as best as she can, from the scene of violence. What is meant by this interiority is the subject’s perception that intimate life has been excluded from the movements and operations of a life subordinated to the authority of prohibition.28 In other words, the discontinuous being who lives in accordance with social regulation as determined by the banishment of violence no longer sees itself as participating in the excess of life destroying itself in dazzling, tumultuous upheavals. Banishment is unevenly realized, and the fact of the matter is that life is never totally forgotten even by those who live according to the strictest rules. The crucial point here, however, is that discontinuity, translated as interiority in the realm of things, takes on the meaning of disguising its innermost truth qua violence. Let’s take a look at how Bataille himself illustrates discontinuity: “Each being is distinct from all others . . . . Between one being and another, there is a gulf, a discontinuity. This gulf exists, for instance, between you, listening to me, and me, speaking to you. We are attempting to communicate, but no communication between us can abolish our fundamental difference. If you die, it is not my death. You and I are discontinuous beings.”29 What is the importance of gesturing toward an infinite gulf separating all individual beings? What does this fundamental difference tell us about self-protecting, self-interested creatures? It seems to me that the infinite abyss, when taken seriously, reminds us that individuated existence is absolutely incomprehensible, unsynthesizable. I say this because if it weren’t true then the discontinuous being could be subsumed by a system of thought which connected this being, in a manner befitting a logical organization of social reality, to all those other beings ostensibly divided by an infinite gulf. But in that case the gulf would be measurable and distinct beings would lose their absolute particularity to a system of thought which beholds in particularity the birth of sameness. Insofar as a particular subject can be assimilated to an all-encompassing logic of reality, it follows that the individual is self-identical, unchanging, and wholly complete.30 An unsynthesizable being can therefore be understood as devoted to its finite, particular ends only on the condition that its self-preservation is seen as a genuine effort. Such an effort assumes that the discontinuous self is vulnerable to all sorts of accidents, diseases, insecurities, predators, injuries, reprisals and the very loss of self which is so urgently defended.

Taboos therefore reinforce a sense of interiority on the part of the subject who removes herself, as best as she can, from the scene of violence.</u> What is meant by this interiority is the subject’s perception that intimate life has been excluded from the movements and operations of a life subordinated to the authority of prohibition.28 <u>In other words, <mark>the discontinuous being who lives in accordance with social regulation as determined by the banishment of violence no longer sees itself as participating in the excess of life</mark> destroying itself in dazzling, tumultuous upheavals</u>. Banishment is unevenly realized, and the fact of the matter is that <u><mark>life is never totally forgotten even by those who live according to the strictest rules.</mark> The crucial point here, however, is that <mark>discontinuity</mark>, translated as interiority in the realm of things, <mark>takes on the meaning of disguising its innermost truth qua violence.</mark> </u>Let’s take a look at how Bataille himself illustrates discontinuity: “<u>Each being is distinct from all others . . . . Between one being and another, there is a gulf, a discontinuity. This gulf exists, for instance, between you, listening to me, and me, speaking to you. We are attempting to communicate, but no communication between us can abolish our fundamental difference<strong>.</u></strong> If you die, it is not my death. You and I are discontinuous beings.”29 What is the importance of gesturing toward an infinite gulf separating all individual beings? What does this fundamental difference tell us about self-protecting, self-interested creatures? It seems to me that <u>the infinite abyss, when taken seriously, reminds us that individuated existence is absolutely incomprehensible, unsynthesizable. I say this because <mark>if it weren’t true then the discontinuous being could be subsumed by a system of thought which connected this being, in a manner befitting a logical organization of social reality, to all those other beings ostensibly divided by an infinite gulf</u></mark>. But in that case the gulf would be measurable and distinct beings would lose their absolute particularity to a system of thought which beholds in particularity the birth of sameness. <u>Insofar as <mark>a particular subject can be assimilated to an all-encompassing logic of reality, it follows that the individual is self-identical, unchanging, and wholly complet</mark>e.30 An unsynthesizable being can therefore be understood as devoted to its finite, particular ends only on the condition that its self-preservation is seen as a genuine effort. <mark>Such an effort assumes that the discontinuous self is vulnerable to all sorts of accidents, diseases, insecurities</mark>, predators, injuries, reprisals and the very loss of self which is so urgently defended. If the closure of discontinuity weren’t vulnerable to the dangers of the outside, as well as the inside, no effort would be required to secure its borders. </p></u>",,Off,,430291,1,17055,./documents/ndtceda14/Dartmouth/AvAn/Dartmouth-Avendano-Anderson-Neg-Navy-Round2.docx,565312,N,Navy,2,Gonzaga Newton-Spraker,Waldinger,"Plan The United States should legalize marijuana by amending the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 to allow states meeting specified criteria to opt out of the federal Controlled Substances Act provisions relating to marihuana

Such rapid change resonates throughout the social body, appearing to threaten to disrupt the perceived social fabric and its associated norms. The threat and experience of this social rupture provokes considerable anxieties on the part of certain groups, who seek to control the social order in order to preserve hegemonic forms of power relations.9 During such periods of flux, issues of problematic consumption (alcohol, gambling, and prostitution) and dangerous identities have been convenient and familiar `targets' for programmes and campaigns of moral regulation.10 Prostitution, which combines both of these elements, thus appears throughout history as `a dense signifier around which a variety of social anxieties' can be expressed.11 Thus, during the intense social and economic transformation which characterized the Victorian era, moral panics around syphilis, venereal disease, and an imagined `white slavery trade'12 expressed wider cultural anxieties over the overlapping processes of urbanization, immigration, and women's shifting roles. Encouraged by a broad coalition of feminists and religious groups who had made saving fallen women their mission, the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1864, 1866, and 1869 constructed the prostitute as morally and physically dangerous and vulnerable, justifying the intensive moral, social, and legal regulation of many unmarried working-class women.13 In so doing, the public's individual moral and social health appeared to be secured, helping to consolidate a particular image of the nation state as healthy and enlightened, all of which facilitated its colonial expansion. As Burton notes, the spectre of sexual slavery employed in campaigns and reforms at this time operated to conceal their facilitation of a wider colonialist project.14 This parallels with the present late-modern period and the dynamics of globalization which provide much of the impetus behind the recent flurry of legislative activity in international prostitution laws. Here the major shifts and increased fluidity in the movement of people, capital, and commodities brought about by globalization and late-capitalist restructuring, alongside a burgeoning sex industry, have incited a similar broad coalition of the religious right, moral puritans, and radical feminists around an abolitionist mission.15 This modern `unholy' alliance has coalesced around a crusade to combat what it regards as `modern sexual slavery', a term applied variously to the `trafficking' of women and girls for purposes of prostitution and to commercial sex more generally. `Saving fallen women' has returned to the policy frame, yet while there is continuity with the earlier nineteenth-century campaigns, its reappearance relates to a new global economic and political context and invokes new forms of governance.16 Once again, the trafficked bodies of sex workers provide a useful metaphor for violated state boundaries and act as a trope for a more general politics of security:17 the putative re-emergence of the `white slave trade' triggered multiple initiatives intended to protect the sovereign spaces of the European Union as much as the sovereign bodies of women.18 The form these multiple initiatives have taken is contingent upon different political traditions and arrangements, meaning that the same forces (that is, globalization) have been the impetus behind what are often cast as opposing regulatory frameworks, the most notable being efforts to criminalize men in Sweden and to legalize voluntary sex work in the Netherlands.19

So shocked was the oil industry that all they commented was that they would work with the governor for ""solutions that will sustain today's energy and economic realities while protecting both our environment and future energy needs."" (Don't hold your breath.) Brown's and Modi's electricity goals are bold, ambitious and exciting. They will be attacked as expensive and unwise. But they cannot be dismissed as impossible --- California has already reached 25% renewable electricity, India is producing the world's cheapest solar power, and other countries like Portugal and Denmark have demonstrated that renewable electricity is ready to carry more than half of their power load. California's oil target is breathtaking. It is what is needed - the latest report on the how much oil we can afford to burn and stay on a 2 degree pathway says that a third of existing global oil reserves must remain underground, including all of such unconventional sources as the deep oceans, the Arctic and tar sands. It is consistent with goals articulated by climate advocates and organizations. But California - and the world -- are starting from almost scratch in seeking fuel diversity in the transportation sector- oil powers more than 90% of the world's transport. Both India and the US have enacted tough fuel efficiency standards to reduce petroleum waste. But California State's low-carbon fuel standard and ZEV mandates are only beginning to kick in, and transportation fuels have just been placed under the state's AB32 cap. (Oregon joined California a few days after Brown's speech putting in place requirements the fuels sold in the state have 10% less carbon by 2020.) Ramping up to a 50% reduction in petroleum use by 2030 will require a massive replacement of the state's existing vehicle fleets, engine technologies, transportation infrastructure and fuel networks. But if California can realize this vision, the odds that the rest of the world moves beyond oil dependency go up staggeringly. Big oil gets this. Houston, Wichita, Calgary and Riyadh have no doubt seen dozens of meetings in the last week about how to crush Brown's vision before the public realizes just how practical it is. ""Mission Impossible"" will be the war-cry. ""They're going to take your car away"" the Koch Brother ads and sound bites will babble. ""Renewable power isn't reliable"" the coal companies will croak. The reality is they are losing. Their campaign strategy - which worked for decades - was to mire the public debate down in climate science and risk, and thereby keep action on climate solutions at the ""too small to really matter"" scale. But they got greedy, and allowed the price of oil and coal to steadily soar. That opened up a market for clean energy that wasn't based on climate protection, although climate security is its most important benefit. No, Tesla and Solar City - and their Indian counterparts -- are powered by the fact that they offered better energy products with cheaper fuels. Renewable energy investment demonstrated this again in 2014. Even as coal, oil and natural gas prices fell, global investment in renewable energy jumped by 16%, and with steadily dropping costs for renewable energy, the volume of new clean energy increased by more than 25%. Now that clean energy technologies have moved to a scale that anyone whose eyes are open can see that we don't necessarily need fossil fuels for much longer, leaders like Modi and Brown - and others around the world - can offer programs that both capture the popular imagination and confront the scale of the energy revolution we need. And as these technologies get bigger, they get cheaper - unlike coal and oil for whom demand growth means ever higher and higher costs.",4062.0,"<h4><strong>Brown’s proposals are modeled and drive global climate solutions </h4><p></strong>Carl <strong>Pope</strong>, <strong>1/13</strong>/2015. Former executive director and chairman, Sierra Club. “Flood Tide for the Climate Movement,” Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-pope/flood-tide-for-the-climate-movement_b_6446832.html.</p><p>Two days later, here in Sacramento, California Governor Jerry <u><mark>Brown committed the world's seventh largest economy to the world's boldest clean energy goals yet: going</mark> from 25% <mark>to 50% renewable electricity</mark> by 2030</u>, <u><mark>and</u></mark> -- stunningly in the state which birthed the freeway culture -- <u><mark>cutting oil consumption by 50%</u></mark> by the same date. So shocked was the oil industry that all they commented was that they would work with the governor for ""solutions that will sustain today's energy and economic realities while protecting both our environment and future energy needs."" (Don't hold your breath.) <u>Brown's</u> and Modi's electricity <u>goals are bold, ambitious and exciting</u>. They will be attacked as expensive and unwise. But <u>they cannot be dismissed as impossible --- California has already reached 25% renewable electricity</u>, India is producing the world's cheapest solar power, and other countries like Portugal and Denmark have demonstrated that renewable electricity is ready to carry more than half of their power load. California's oil target is breathtaking. It is what is needed - the latest report on the how much oil we can afford to burn and stay on a 2 degree pathway says that a third of existing global oil reserves must remain underground, including all of such unconventional sources as the deep oceans, the Arctic and tar sands. It is consistent with goals articulated by climate advocates and organizations. But <u>California - <strong>and the world</strong> -- are starting from almost scratch in seeking fuel diversity in the transportation sector- oil powers more than 90% of the world's transport</u>. Both India and the US have enacted tough fuel efficiency standards to reduce petroleum waste. But California State's low-carbon fuel standard and ZEV mandates are only beginning to kick in, and transportation fuels have just been placed under the state's AB32 cap. (Oregon joined California a few days after Brown's speech putting in place requirements the fuels sold in the state have 10% less carbon by 2020.) <u>Ramping up to a 50% reduction in petroleum use by 2030 will require a massive replacement of the state's existing vehicle fleets, engine technologies, transportation infrastructure and fuel networks</u>. <u>But <mark>if California can realize this vision, the odds that the rest of the world moves beyond oil dependency<strong> go up staggeringly</u></strong></mark>. Big oil gets this. Houston, Wichita, Calgary and Riyadh have no doubt seen dozens of meetings in the last week about how to crush Brown's vision before the public realizes just how practical it is. ""Mission Impossible"" will be the war-cry. ""They're going to take your car away"" the Koch Brother ads and sound bites will babble. ""Renewable power isn't reliable"" the coal companies will croak. The reality is they are losing. Their campaign strategy - which worked for decades - was to mire the public debate down in climate science and risk, and thereby keep action on climate solutions at the ""too small to really matter"" scale. But they got greedy, and allowed the price of oil and coal to steadily soar. That opened up a market for clean energy that wasn't based on climate protection, although climate security is its most important benefit. No, Tesla and Solar City - and their Indian counterparts -- are powered by the fact that they offered better energy products with cheaper fuels. Renewable energy investment demonstrated this again in 2014. Even as coal, oil and natural gas prices fell, global investment in renewable energy jumped by 16%, and with steadily dropping costs for renewable energy, the volume of new clean energy increased by more than 25%. <u>Now that clean energy technologies have moved to a scale that anyone whose eyes are open can see that we don't necessarily need fossil fuels for much longer, <mark>leaders</mark> like</u> Modi and <u>Brown</u> - and others around the world - <u><mark>can offer programs that</mark> both capture the popular imagination and <mark>confront the scale of the energy revolution we need</u>.</mark> <u>And <mark>as these technologies get bigger, they get cheaper</mark> - unlike coal and oil for whom demand growth means ever higher and higher costs</u><strong>.</p></strong>",,,Politics,430357,13,17060,./documents/ndtceda14/Dartmouth/AvMa/Dartmouth-Avendano-Martin-Neg-Cedanats-Round7.docx,565294,N,Cedanats,7,Fresno State Levin-Sicairos,Munday,"1AC - PAS for death row inmates

When is the Internet going to collapse? The answer is NEVER. The Internet is amazing for no other reason than that it hasn't simply collapsed, never to be rebooted. Over a decade ago, many pundits were predicting an all-out catastrophic failure, and back then the load was nothing compared with what it is today. So how much more can this network take? Let's look at the basic changes that have occurred since the Net became chat-worthy around 1990. First of all, only a few people were on the Net back in 1990, since it was essentially a carrier for e-mail (spam free!), newsgroups, gopher, and FTP. These capabilities remain. But the e-mail load has grown to phenomenal proportions and become burdened with megatons of spam. In one year, the amount of spam can exceed a decade's worth, say 1990 to 2000, of all Internet traffic. It's actually the astonishing overall growth of the Internet that is amazing. In 1990, the total U.S. backbone throughput of the Internet was 1 terabyte, and in 1991 it doubled to 2TB. Throughput continued to double until 1996, when it jumped to 1,500TB. After that huge jump, it returned to doubling, reaching 80,000 to 140,000TB in 2002. This ridiculous growth rate has continued as more and more services are added to the burden. The jump in 1996 is attributable to the one-two punch of the universal popularization of the Web and the introduction of the MP3 standard and subsequent music file sharing. More recently, the emergence of inane video clips (YouTube and the rest) as universal entertainment has continued to slam the Net with overhead, as has large video file sharing via BitTorrent and other systems. Then VoIP came along, and IPTV is next. All the while, e-mail numbers are in the trillions of messages, and spam has never been more plentiful and bloated. Add blogging, vlogging, and twittering and it just gets worse. According to some expensive studies, the growth rate has begun to slow down to something like 50 percent per year. But that's growth on top of huge numbers. Petabytes. So when does this thing just grind to a halt or blow up? To date, we have to admit that the structure of the Net is robust, to say the least. This is impressive, considering the fact that experts were predicting a collapse in the 1990s. Robust or not, this Internet is a transportation system. It transports data. All transportation systems eventually need upgrading, repair, basic changes, or reinvention. But what needs to be done here? This, to me, has come to be the big question. Does anything at all need to be done, or do we run it into the ground and then fix it later? Is this like a jalopy leaking oil and water about to blow, or an organic perpetual-motion machine that fixes itself somehow? Many believe that the Net has never collapsed because it does tend to fix itself. A decade ago we were going to run out of IP addresses—remember? It righted itself, with rotating addresses and subnets. Many of the Net's improvements are self-improvements. Only spam, viruses, and spyware represent incurable diseases that could kill the organism. I have to conclude that the worst-case scenario for the Net is an outage here or there, if anywhere. After all, the phone system, a more machine-intensive system, never really imploded after years and years of growth, did it? While it has outages, it's actually more reliable than the power grid it sits on. Why should the Internet be any different now that it is essentially run by phone companies who know how to keep networks up? And let's be real here.

Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) that managed to accrue the support of 60 senators in both parties despite opposition from the White House. Kirk and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said over the weekend that an Iran vote could occur in January after a vote on Keystone, which is the first bill the Republican Senate will take up and is also opposed by President Barack Obama. Republican leaders have not yet finalized their legislative schedule, but the bipartisan Iran proposal is supported by incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and all of his leadership team. And taking a confrontational stance toward Iran as diplomatic negotiations continue with a group of Western nations appears to be top of mind for the new Senate Republican majority. “It’s an important issue, a priority, and has wide bipartisan support in the Senate,” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart on Monday. The Republican House overwhelmingly passed a sanctions bill targeting Iran’s energy industry in 2013, though that legislation was never taken up by the Senate. The Kirk-Menendez legislation would tighten economic sanctions on Iran if the country walks away from ongoing negotiations over nuclear enrichment or reneges on an interim agreement that has frozen some of Iran’s nuclear activities in return for unwinding some sanctions. In November, Western and Iranians negotiators extended that interim deal until July as they attempt to hammer out a permanent deal that would curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions and relax sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy and isolated the country globally. A separate bill written by Graham and incoming Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) would require Congress to approve of any final deal and could figure into the GOP’s plans next year. “You will see a very vigorous Congress when it comes to Iran. You will see a Congress making sure that sanctions are real and will be reimposed at the drop of a hat. You will see a Congress wanting to have any say about a final deal,” Graham said at a weekend press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A dozen returning Senate Democrats officially signed on in support of the Kirk-Menendez legislation in 2014, though President Barack Obama’s administration convinced other on-the-fence members to hold off public support after warning that voting on that legislation could upset ongoing negotiations. While the Kirk-Menendez legislation could very well accrue 60 votes to clear the Senate in the new Congress, Democratic aides on Monday declined to estimate the level of enthusiasm for fresh sanctions in the new year. Indeed, the largest challenge for both supporters of Iran sanctions and the Keystone pipeline is building veto-proof levels of support in Congress that would require dozens of Democrats in the House and Senate to oppose the White House. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in November that new penalties during negotiations would be “counterproductive.” Garnering 67 votes in the Senate for the Kirk-Menendez bill could be a steep task, given the defeat of several moderate Democratic supporters, opposition from Obama and lack of unanimous support in the GOP. But Kirk said on Sunday in an interview with Fox news that he expects “really bipartisan votes” and predicted having a “shot of even getting to a veto-proof majority in the Senate.”",3916.0,"<h4>Obama can sustain a veto of Iran sanctions now- but it’s close- PC’s key</h4><p><strong>Politico 12/29</strong>/2014 (GOP to move on Iran sanctions legislation, http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/gop-senate-iran-sanctions-bill-113852.html)</p><p>Congressional <u><mark>Republicans are setting up early challenges</mark> t<mark>o</u></mark> President Barack <u>O<mark>bama</u></mark> in January, <u>preparing to move forward quickly on</u> new <u>Iran</u> sanctions legislation following on the heels of a vote on a bill approving the Keystone XL Pipeline. <u>The</u> Republican-controlled <u><mark>Senate is expected to vote on legislation that would impose additional economic penalties on Iran in the first few weeks of next yea</mark>r</u>, according to Republican senators and aides.

Asian security in the aftermath of World War II was shaped by three forces: economic nationalism, security bilateralism (anchored on the US’s ‘hub-and-spoke’ alliances), and political authoritarianism. Over the decades, Asia has seen a major growth in economic internationalism, multilateral institutions and democratisation.  Since the mid-1950s, intra-Asian trade has nearly doubled to over 50 per cent of the region’s total trade. The effect of economic interdependence and multilateral institutions in promoting peace has been well documented by international relations scholars. In Asia today, production networks straddle national boundaries, making them especially costly to break; multipurpose regional institutions have proliferated; and cooperative institutions now outnumber formal military alliances, thus reversing the Cold War pattern.  Democracies in Asia today outnumber autocracies and, despite fears that democratic transitions might produce aggressively nationalistic regimes, no newly democratic regime in Asia has behaved this way.  The Asian regional order today resembles neither the 19th century Concert of Europe, nor the EU of today. The EU model is implausible in a highly sovereignty-conscious Asia. An Asian concert of powers is unrealistic and dangerous. The two most important pitfalls of this idea are long-known. First, for a concert to function successfully it requires a degree of ideological convergence among the major powers. Such a convergence does not exist pending China’s democratisation. On the other hand, a concert based on current ideological conditions would be a welcome gift to China’s authoritarian rulers, as it would preserve a conservative status quo that would arrest China’s democratisation.  A concert of this type would also necessarily marginalise weaker states. The Concert of Europe, as historian Richard Elrod points out, ensured a degree of self-restraint among the great powers toward each other, but also brought about ‘great power tutelage over the rest of Europe’ before collapsing over ideological divergence. An Asian concert would imply de facto Sino–US joint rule, but will the rest of Asia really want to live under Chinese or US tutelage?  In contrast, Asia’s regional groups like the ASEAN Regional Forum or the East Asian Summit facilitate the peaceful engagement of great powers with each other and with the region, without reducing weaker states to the status of vassals and pawns. The rise of China requires adjustments and strengthening of the current order — not reinventing an outdated model. Asia’s future need not resemble Europe’s past or present. Nor will it resemble past US foreign policy. The revival of a tributary order would be similarly countered by the economic, strategic and cultural influence of the US, Japan, India and Russia.  Moreover, a concert model may not serve Australia’s security interests because it will almost certainly be excluded from it. Asia and Australia are better served by a model based on the kind of ‘entrepreneurial’ and ‘intellectual’ leadership to which Japan, Australia and ASEAN (now South Korea, Indonesia and India) have made a contribution, and which has brought about the simultaneous engagement of China and the US.  For all its recent diplomatic assertiveness, China supports and sustains Asian economic interdependence and institutions, as do the US, Japan and India. At the same time, US alliances and security ties with India offer a hedge against any future uncertainty in Chinese behaviour.

The US paradigm for regulation of xenotransplantation
The US federal government’s authority to regulate xenotransplantation stems from its jurisdiction over interstate commerce and is vested in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FD&C), and Public Health Service Act. These laws are interpreted and fleshed out in detail in the Code of Federal Regulations. These regulations, whether issued by the FDA or other executive agencies [such as the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)], have the force of law and constitute the practical basis for governmental oversight of US xenotransplantation activities.
The US commitment to establishing a national regulatory framework for xenotransplantation has been considerable. Five agencies within the HHS were actively involved in developing the US regulatory model, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health. This has resulted in the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework to enable the appropriate pre-clinical development of xenotransplantation toward the initiation of clinical trials, taking into account the special issues raised by this novel biomedical technology.
To achieve its mission, the HHS developed a comprehensive paradigm for regulation of xenotransplantation. This essentially consisted of a set of applicable laws and regulations with enforcement provisions, a centralized authority with regulatory oversight of xenotransplantation (the FDA, in particular through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and in case of inclusion of a device, also through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health), and a set of guidance documents that represent the FDA’s current thinking on a given topic. The need for transparency and organization of forums for public discussion represented another important aspect of the US paradigm that also included the establishment of the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation (SACX) in 2001 with the aim of making recommendations to the HHS Secretary on policy and procedures and, as needed, changes to regulations and guidances. The SACX also developed a guidance on consent procedures for xenotransplantation trials, which was released in draft form for public comment but was not finalized prior to the disbandment of the SACX in 2005.
The process of developing a comprehensive xenotransplantation policy was achieved through the accomplishment of several significant milestones. In particular, the “US Public Health Service (PHS) draft guideline on infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation” (1996) was the first document that clearly articulated the fundamental regulatory process to minimize the risk of transmission of xenogeneic infections. Subsequently, two public meetings were organized by the agency aimed at acquiring public feedback regarding public health concerns raised by xenotransplantation, one on “Cross-species infectivity and pathogenesis” (1997) and one on “Developing US policy on xenotransplantation” (1998), which included international participation. In 2001, the FDA released “PHS guideline on infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation” [11] and, in 2003, “Guidance for industry: source animal, product, preclinical, and clinical issues concerning the use of xenotransplantation products in humans [12].” Avoidance of xenogeneic infectious disease transmission was the appropriate primary concern of the US regulations, which inspired and directly contributed to regulatory guidelines developed by other countries. These documents do not carry the force of law; they offer guidance to investigators, patients, and industry regarding the criteria by which the FDA will evaluate a proposed xenotransplantation trial.",3973.0,"<h4><strong>Federal regulations will not permit xenotransplants if infection is a risk – none of their evidence considers this</h4><p>Cozzi  9</strong>    Emanuele Cozzi et al- Department of Surgical and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padua, Italy    Xenotransplantation    Volume 16, Issue 4, pages 203–214, July/August 2009</p><p>Chapter 1: Key ethical requirements and progress toward the definition of an international regulatory framework</p><p><u>The US paradigm for regulation of xenotransplantation</p><p><mark>The</mark> </u>US <u>federal <mark>government’s authority to regulate xenotransplantation</u></mark> stems from its jurisdiction over interstate commerce and <u><mark>is</mark> <mark>vested in the</u></mark> U.S. Food and Drug Administration (<u><mark>FDA</mark>)</u> through the Food Drug and Cosmetics Act (FD&C), and Public Health Service Act. These laws are interpreted and fleshed out in detail in the Code of Federal Regulations. These <u><mark>regulations, whether issued by the FDA or other executive agencies </u>[<u>such as</u></mark> the US Department of Health and Human Services (<u><mark>HHS</mark>)</u> or the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)], <u><mark>have the force of law and constitute the practical basis for governmental oversight of US xenotransplantation activities.</p><p>The US commitment to establishing a national regulatory framework for xenotransplantation has been considerable</mark>.</u> Five agencies within the HHS were actively involved in developing the US regulatory model, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health. This has resulted in the development of a comprehensive regulatory framework to enable the appropriate pre-clinical development of xenotransplantation toward the initiation of clinical trials, taking into account the special issues raised by this novel biomedical technology.</p><p>To achieve its mission, <u>the HHS developed a comprehensive paradigm for regulation of xenotransplantation</u>. This essentially consisted of a set of applicable laws and regulations with enforcement provisions, a centralized authority with regulatory oversight of xenotransplantation (the FDA, in particular through the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research and in case of inclusion of a device, also through the Center for Devices and Radiological Health), and a set of guidance documents that represent the FDA’s current thinking on a given topic. The need for transparency and organization of forums for public discussion represented another important aspect of the US paradigm that also included the establishment of the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Xenotransplantation (SACX) in 2001 with the aim of making recommendations to the HHS Secretary on policy and procedures and, as needed, changes to regulations and guidances. The SACX also developed a guidance on consent procedures for xenotransplantation trials, which was released in draft form for public comment but was not finalized prior to the disbandment of the SACX in 2005.</p><p><u><mark>The process of developing a comprehensive xenotransplantation policy was achieved through the accomplishment of several significant milestones. In particular</u>, <u>the</u></mark> “US Public Health Service (<u><mark>PHS) draft guideline on infectious disease issues in xenotransplantation”</u></mark> (1996) was the first document that clearly articulated the fundamental regulatory process to minimize the risk of transmission of xenogeneic infections.

The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to vote on legislation that would impose additional economic penalties on Iran in the first few weeks of next year, according to Republican senators and aides. The starting point would be a bill written a year ago by Sens. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) that managed to accrue the support of 60 senators in both parties despite opposition from the White House. Kirk and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said over the weekend that an Iran vote could occur in January after a vote on Keystone, which is the first bill the Republican Senate will take up and is also opposed by President Barack Obama. Republican leaders have not yet finalized their legislative schedule, but the bipartisan Iran proposal is supported by incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and all of his leadership team. And taking a confrontational stance toward Iran as diplomatic negotiations continue with a group of Western nations appears to be top of mind for the new Senate Republican majority. “It’s an important issue, a priority, and has wide bipartisan support in the Senate,” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart on Monday. The Republican House overwhelmingly passed a sanctions bill targeting Iran’s energy industry in 2013, though that legislation was never taken up by the Senate. The Kirk-Menendez legislation would tighten economic sanctions on Iran if the country walks away from ongoing negotiations over nuclear enrichment or reneges on an interim agreement that has frozen some of Iran’s nuclear activities in return for unwinding some sanctions. In November, Western and Iranians negotiators extended that interim deal until July as they attempt to hammer out a permanent deal that would curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions and relax sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy and isolated the country globally. A separate bill written by Graham and incoming Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) would require Congress to approve of any final deal and could figure into the GOP’s plans next year. “You will see a very vigorous Congress when it comes to Iran. You will see a Congress making sure that sanctions are real and will be reimposed at the drop of a hat. You will see a Congress wanting to have any say about a final deal,” Graham said at a weekend press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A dozen returning Senate Democrats officially signed on in support of the Kirk-Menendez legislation in 2014, though President Barack Obama’s administration convinced other on-the-fence members to hold off public support after warning that voting on that legislation could upset ongoing negotiations. While the Kirk-Menendez legislation could very well accrue 60 votes to clear the Senate in the new Congress, Democratic aides on Monday declined to estimate the level of enthusiasm for fresh sanctions in the new year. Indeed, the largest challenge for both supporters of Iran sanctions and the Keystone pipeline is building veto-proof levels of support in Congress that would require dozens of Democrats in the House and Senate to oppose the White House. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in November that new penalties during negotiations would be “counterproductive.” Garnering 67 votes in the Senate for the Kirk-Menendez bill could be a steep task, given the defeat of several moderate Democratic supporters, opposition from Obama and lack of unanimous support in the GOP.

And <u><mark>taking a confrontational stance toward Iran</u></mark> as diplomatic negotiations continue with a group of Western nations <u><mark>appears to be top of mind for the new Senate Republican majority</mark>. </u>“It’s an important issue, a priority, and has wide bipartisan support in the Senate,” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart on Monday. The Republican House overwhelmingly passed a sanctions bill targeting Iran’s energy industry in 2013, though that legislation was never taken up by the Senate. The Kirk-Menendez legislation would tighten economic sanctions on Iran if the country walks away from ongoing negotiations over nuclear enrichment or reneges on an interim agreement that has frozen some of Iran’s nuclear activities in return for unwinding some sanctions. In November, Western and Iranians negotiators extended that interim deal until July as they attempt to hammer out a permanent deal that would curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions and relax sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy and isolated the country globally. A separate bill written by Graham and incoming Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) would require Congress to approve of any final deal and could figure into the GOP’s plans next year. “<u>You will see a very vigorous Congress when it comes to Iran</u>. You will see a Congress making sure that sanctions are real and will be reimposed at the drop of a hat. You will see a Congress wanting to have any say about a final deal,” Graham said at a weekend press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. <u>A dozen returning Senate Democrats officially signed on in support of the <mark>Kirk-Menendez</mark> legislation in 2014, though </u>President Barack <u><strong><mark>Obama</u></strong>’s</mark> administration <u><strong><mark>convinced other on-the-fence members to hold off</u></strong></mark> public support after warning that voting on that <u><strong><mark>legislation could upset ongoing negotiations</u></strong>.</mark> <u>While the Kirk-Menendez legislation could very well accrue 60 votes to clear the Senate in the new Congress</u>, Democratic <u>aides</u> on Monday <u>declined to estimate the level of enthusiasm for fresh sanctions in the new year. </u>Indeed, <u><strong><mark>the largest challenge</u></strong></mark> for both supporters of Iran sanctions and the Keystone pipeline <u><strong><mark>is building veto-proof</u></strong></mark> levels of <u><strong><mark>support</u></strong></mark> in Congress <u>that would require dozens of Democrats in the House and Senate to oppose the White House.</u> White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in November that new penalties during negotiations would be “counterproductive.” <u><mark>Garnering 67 votes in the Senate for the Kirk-Menendez bill could be a <strong>steep task</u></strong>,</mark> <u><mark>given the defeat of several moderate Democratic supporters, opposition from Obama and lack of unanimous support in the GOP</u></mark>. But <u>Kirk</u> said on Sunday in an interview with Fox news that he <u>expects “really bipartisan votes” and predicted having a “shot of even getting to a veto-proof majority in the Senate</u>.”</p>",1nc,,politics,430411,46,17066,./documents/ndtceda14/Dartmouth/KrAh/Dartmouth-Kreus-Ahmad-Neg-Hurricanedebates2015-Round3.docx,565286,N,Hurricanedebates2015,3,Vanderbilt Bilgi-Mitchell,Harrigan,"Security K (2NR)

By contrast, declaring war on terrorists who do not target Americans invites obscure violent groups around the world to make us their enemies. A lack of discrimination in choosing whom to attack also strengthens terrorists by granting them recognition and encourages alliances between otherwise separate terror groups. Our enemy today, for instance, is not Islam, not Islamism, not Islamic fundamentalism, not Wahabism, not Salafists, and not even jihadists, per se. Our enemies are those who attack Americans and those who shelter them. Most jihadists are fighting their local governments. In the long term, their struggle will probably fail.

American participation in the political conflicts in the Islamic world makes the United States a target of the terrorists involved in those conflicts, and American involvement feeds the conspiracy theories that make supposed evildoers in Washington the excuse for all that goes wrong in the Middle East. Non-intervention in Middle Eastern politics should not be regarded as appeasement, but as a key component of counterterrorism. In the rare circumstances in which the United States needs to invade or even occupy part of the Muslim world, as in Afghanistan, the U.S. military should diminish its footprint and limit its stay. The United States should not shrink from stating that we believe that liberal democracy is a good form of government, but we should model democracy rather than insisting that others adopt it.

Such cooperation may occasionally cause the kind of blowback that a policy of restraint seeks to avoid, but in cases like Pakistan’s, where the terrorist threat is high enough, the benefit of intelligence cooperation outweighs this cost. In any case, the blowback from cooperation with law enforcement and intelligence agencies will be much less severe than that generated by the current American strategy with its emphasis on military force and occupation. The principal military role in counterterrorism should be the use of special operations forces to assist foreign governments in attacking anti-American terrorists.

Whereas she demonstrates that human security is also a  form of securitization, she contents with the idea that both concepts just have different orien- tations: “Rather, each is important in its own unique way: one contributing to our understand- ing of how security is practiced, the other – on occasion and if successful – to its practice.”  (Floyd 2007: 45f.). I will show in the following, that this reasoning is not without problems. 3  A criticism of the (broad) human security approach   3.1  The interconnectedness of the analytical and the political dimension  I think however, that the approaches cannot be separated easily – even though Floyd ex- presses this correctly rather carefully; rather it  shows, that because of its lacking analytical  preciseness the human security approach underachieves also politically and respectively at- tains results opposite to its actual goals.  Although it seems plausible that human security (in its broad interpretation) as general norma- tive-ethical position is of interest – it is however, not any more concrete than the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and thus holds little additional benefit. It clarifies that these  human rights are part of security; by interpreting security in an extensively broad degree, hu- man security cannot surpass such a declaration and add to practical use. Because of its impre- ciseness, human security cannot be the aim in the sense of a concrete, political basis; exact  statements which would render human security a meaningful political category are not con- tained in this concept. Defining human security as “political leitmotif” (Werthes/Bosold 2005,  2006) seems therefore exaggerated.  Human security is even less a political route to this objective, since the concept exhibits too  many weaknesses as a guideline for actions. Because what happens is simply the following:  well-being or the good life are formulated as desirable goals and then immediately defined as  security matters. This does not result in any additional insight (who doesn’t strive for well- being in general?), but creates the problem that from now on, all relevant issues suffer from  human security’s arbitrariness and are handled following the logic of security – which is quite  different to e.g. the logic of economic, food, health, environmental, or social issues. When this  happens, dangerous consequences – intended or not – might occur.  In this context, security becomes the ultimate principle of the social world (Wæver 1995: 48).  Thus the logic of security is extended to other social fields, which lose specificity however  (Wæver 1995: 50). If, for example, questions of human development or development of de- mocracy are seen through the eyes of security, then these questions will also be answered  from a security’s point of view (and not in respect to the original aims). This evolution can be observed on all levels: Instead of focusing e.g. on long term development of democratic insti- tutions and culture, a system might be – in the name of (human) security – overthrown with military means to then try reconstruction from the left over ruins (see example of Iraq above).  Or, regarding the domestic sphere, instead of providing homeless with sustainable support,  consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places is forbidden in the name of public secu- rity – and the homeless therewith driven away from  commercial areas, where they are re- garded as disturbing elements (Körner 2006, IPWB).  Essentially different situations are thus treated in a uniform way that might be counterproduc- tive at times. Wæver expresses this even more drastically:  “Consequently, the logic of war–of challenge-resistance(defense)-escalation-recognition/defeat– could be replayed metaphorically and extended to other sectors.

Asian security in the aftermath of World War II was shaped by three forces: economic nationalism, security bilateralism (anchored on the US’s ‘hub-and-spoke’ alliances), and political authoritarianism. Over the decades, Asia has seen a major growth in economic internationalism, multilateral institutions and democratisation.  Since the mid-1950s, intra-Asian trade has nearly doubled to over 50 per cent of the region’s total trade. The effect of economic interdependence and multilateral institutions in promoting peace has been well documented by international relations scholars. In Asia today, production networks straddle national boundaries, making them especially costly to break; multipurpose regional institutions have proliferated; and cooperative institutions now outnumber formal military alliances, thus reversing the Cold War pattern.  Democracies in Asia today outnumber autocracies and, despite fears that democratic transitions might produce aggressively nationalistic regimes, no newly democratic regime in Asia has behaved this way.  The Asian regional order today resembles neither the 19th century Concert of Europe, nor the EU of today. The EU model is implausible in a highly sovereignty-conscious Asia. An Asian concert of powers is unrealistic and dangerous. The two most important pitfalls of this idea are long-known. First, for a concert to function successfully it requires a degree of ideological convergence among the major powers. Such a convergence does not exist pending China’s democratisation. On the other hand, a concert based on current ideological conditions would be a welcome gift to China’s authoritarian rulers, as it would preserve a conservative status quo that would arrest China’s democratisation.  A concert of this type would also necessarily marginalise weaker states. The Concert of Europe, as historian Richard Elrod points out, ensured a degree of self-restraint among the great powers toward each other, but also brought about ‘great power tutelage over the rest of Europe’ before collapsing over ideological divergence. An Asian concert would imply de facto Sino–US joint rule, but will the rest of Asia really want to live under Chinese or US tutelage?  In contrast, Asia’s regional groups like the ASEAN Regional Forum or the East Asian Summit facilitate the peaceful engagement of great powers with each other and with the region, without reducing weaker states to the status of vassals and pawns. The rise of China requires adjustments and strengthening of the current order — not reinventing an outdated model. Asia’s future need not resemble Europe’s past or present. Nor will it resemble past US foreign policy. The revival of a tributary order would be similarly countered by the economic, strategic and cultural influence of the US, Japan, India and Russia.  Moreover, a concert model may not serve Australia’s security interests because it will almost certainly be excluded from it. Asia and Australia are better served by a model based on the kind of ‘entrepreneurial’ and ‘intellectual’ leadership to which Japan, Australia and ASEAN (now South Korea, Indonesia and India) have made a contribution, and which has brought about the simultaneous engagement of China and the US.  For all its recent diplomatic assertiveness, China supports and sustains Asian economic interdependence and institutions, as do the US, Japan and India. At the same time, US alliances and security ties with India offer a hedge against any future uncertainty in Chinese behaviour.  In Asia today there are multiple mechanisms of stability: economic interdependence raises the stakes of mutual survival and well-being; US-centred alliances preserve the balance of power; and cooperative institutions develop a habit of dialogue and thereby moderate extreme, unilateral behaviour. None of these is sufficient by itself to guarantee order, but together they create the conditions for stability.",4058.0,"<h4>No Asian war.</h4><p><u><strong>Acharya 12</u></strong> [Amitav Acharya is Professor of International Relations at American University, Washington, DC.

Moreover, a concert model may not serve Australia’s security interests because it will almost certainly be excluded from it. Asia and Australia are better served by a model based on the kind of ‘entrepreneurial’ and ‘intellectual’ leadership to which Japan, Australia and ASEAN (now South Korea, Indonesia and India) have made a contribution, and which has brought about the simultaneous engagement of China and the US.  For all its recent diplomatic assertiveness, <u><mark>China supports and sustains Asian economic interdependence and institutions, as do the US, Japan and India.</u></mark> At the same time, US alliances and security ties with India offer a hedge against any future uncertainty in Chinese behaviour.

Critics again point to the fact, as it is understood, of numerous occasions when initial steps in alert sequences for US nuclear forces were embarked upon, or at least called for, by indicators mistaken or misconstrued. In none of these instances, it is accepted, did matters get at all near to nuclear launch-extraordinary good fortune again, critics have suggested. But the rival and more logical inference from hundreds of events stretching over sixty years of experience presents itself once more: that the probability of initial misinterpretation leading far towards mistaken launch is remote. Precisely because any nuclear-weapon possessor recognizes the vast gravity of any launch, release sequences have many steps, and human decision is repeatedly interposed as well as capping the sequences. To convey that because a first step was prompted the world somehow came close to accidental nuclear war is wild hyperbole, rather like asserting, when a tennis champion has lost his opening service game, that he was nearly beaten in straight sets. History anyway scarcely offers any ready example of major war started by accident even before the nuclear revolution imposed an order-of-magnitude increase in caution. It was occasionally conjectured that nuclear war might be triggered by the real but accidental or unauthorized launch of a strategic nuclear-weapon delivery system in the direction of a potential adversary. No such launch is known to have occurred in over sixty years. The probability of it is therefore very low. But even if it did happen, the further hypothesis of its initiating a general nuclear exchange is far-fetched. It fails to consider the real situation of decision-makers, as pages 63-4 have brought out. The notion that cosmic holocaust might be mistakenly precipitated in this way belongs to science fiction. One special form of miscalculation appeared sporadically in the speculations of academic commentators, though it was scarcely ever to be encountered-at least so far as my own observation went-in the utterances of practical planners within government. This is the idea that nuclear war might be erroneously triggered, or erroneously widened, through a state under attack misreading either what sort of attack it was being subjected to, or where the attack came from. The postulated misreading of the nature of the attack referred in particular to the hypothesis that if a delivery system-normally a missile-that was known to be capable of carrying either a nuclear or a conventional warhead was launched in a conventional role, the target country might, on detecting the launch through its earlywarning systems, misconstrue the mission as an imminent nuclear strike and immediately unleash a nuclear counter-strike of its own. This conjecture was voiced, for example, as a criticism of the proposals for giving the US Trident SLBM, long associated with nuclear missions, a capability to deliver conventional warheads. Whatever the merit of those proposals (it is not explored here), it is hard to regard this particular apprehension as having any real-life credibility. The flight time of a ballistic missile would not exceed about thirty minutes, and that of a cruise missile a few hours, before arrival on target made its character-conventional or nuclear-unmistakable. No government will need, and no nonlunatic government could wish, to take within so short a span of time a step as enormous and irrevocable as the execution of a nuclear strike on the basis of early-warning information alone without knowing the true nature of the incoming attack. The speculation tends moreover to be expressed without reference either to any realistic political or conflict-related context thought to render the episode plausible, or to the manifest interest of the launching country, should there be any risk of doubt, in ensuring-by explicit communication if necessary-that there was no misinterpretation of its conventionally armed launch.",4077.0,"<h4>Rationality checks miscalculation.</h4><p><u><strong>Quinlan 9</u></strong> [Sir Michael, co-founder and President Emeritus of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, 2009, Thinking About Nuclear Weapons: Principle, Problems, Prospects, p. 68-71]</p><p>Similar considerations apply to the hypothesis of nuclear war being mistakenly triggered by false alarm.

742748,Destroys PC- outweighs the link,NYT 9/26,"NYT 9/26/2014 (New York Times, Holder Resigns, Setting Up Fight Over Successor, lexis)",Obama's announcement that Holder would leave sets up an election-season scramble for a replacement Holder emerged as the primary political antagonist That anger among Republicans could be a political nightmare for Obama If Republicans take control of the Senate the president's pick to replace Holder will face enormous scrutiny without support from a friendly leadership McConnell will be scrutinizing the president's replacement nominee,Obama's announcement that would leave sets up an election-season scramble for a replacement Holder emerged as the primary political antagonist f That anger could be a political nightmare for Obama the president's pick will face enormous scrutiny without support from a friendly leadership,"President Obama's announcement on Thursday that Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. would leave the administration sets up an election-season scramble for a replacement to carry on Mr. Holder's civil rights crusade, wage rhetorical combat with Congress and manage the legal complexities of a presidency increasingly drawn into war with terrorists. One of the earliest members of Mr. Obama's cabinet, Mr. Holder, 63, became the nation's first African-American attorney general and the president's chief liberal warrior, especially on efforts to protect voter rights and end racial discrimination in the justice system. He also emerged as the primary political antagonist for a Republican opposition in Congress that viewed him as dismissive of existing laws and contemptuous of its oversight of his department. That still-simmering anger among Republicans, who once voted to hold Mr. Holder in contempt of Congress, could be a political nightmare for Mr. Obama as he searches for a replacement who can win confirmation in the Senate. Democrats on Capitol Hill are bracing for attacks on any nominee involved in what Republicans consider scandals: political targeting by the Internal Revenue Service, the terrorist attacks on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi or the numerous executive actions by Mr. Obama circumventing Congress. Frequently mentioned candidates to replace Mr. Holder include Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel who remains close to Mr. Obama; Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts; Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr.; former Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan; Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, a former prosecutor; Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York; and Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. Mr. Patrick on Thursday said that it was not the right time for him to take such a job. White House officials said that Mr. Obama had not yet decided on a successor, with one official saying the president was ''a long way'' from an announcement. In a ceremony in the State Dining Room on Thursday, Mr. Obama said Mr. Holder had promised to stay in his job until a successor was confirmed. ''I chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes, as I do, that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it's a living and breathing principle,'' Mr. Obama said, adding that Mr. Holder used the law to improve people's lives. ''That's why I made him America's lawyer, the people's lawyer.'' Mr. Holder's resignation was not a surprise; he had said previously that he planned to leave office by the end of 2014 after six years in the job. Selecting the next attorney general is likely to be complicated by the uncertainty of the future political landscape in Washington. If Republicans take control of the Senate in the midterm elections this November, the president's pick to replace Mr. Holder will face enormous scrutiny without support from a friendly leadership in control of the legislative agenda. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who would most likely take over as the majority leader if his party wins control in November, accused Mr. Holder on Thursday of placing ideology above the rule of law during his tenure. Mr. McConnell urged Mr. Obama to name a replacement who, he said, would have more respect for the law. ''I will be scrutinizing the president's replacement nominee to ensure the Justice Department finally returns to prioritizing law enforcement over partisan concerns,'' Mr. McConnell said. Conservatives spent years attacking Mr. Holder's integrity, especially over the Justice Department's botched gun-trafficking operation called Fast and Furious. Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, issued a statement calling Mr. Holder ''the nation's most corrupt attorney general'' and vowed not to let Mr. Obama push through ''another partisan hack for attorney general.''",3955.0,"<h4>Destroys PC- outweighs the link</h4><p><strong>NYT 9/26</strong>/2014 (New York Times, Holder Resigns, Setting Up Fight Over Successor, lexis)</p><p>President <u><mark>Obama's announcement</u></mark> on Thursday <u><mark>that</u></mark> Attorney General Eric H. <u>Holder</u> Jr. <u><mark>would</u> <u>leave</u></mark> the administration <u><mark>sets up an election-season scramble for a replacement</u></mark> to carry on Mr. Holder's civil rights crusade, wage rhetorical combat with Congress and manage the legal complexities of a presidency increasingly drawn into war with terrorists. One of the earliest members of Mr. Obama's cabinet, Mr. <u><mark>Holder</u></mark>, 63, became the nation's first African-American attorney general and the president's chief liberal warrior, especially on efforts to protect voter rights and end racial discrimination in the justice system.

Democrats on Capitol Hill are bracing for attacks on any nominee involved in what Republicans consider scandals: political targeting by the Internal Revenue Service, the terrorist attacks on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi or the numerous executive actions by Mr. Obama circumventing Congress. Frequently mentioned candidates to replace Mr. Holder include Kathryn Ruemmler, the former White House counsel who remains close to Mr. Obama; Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts; Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr.; former Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan; Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, a former prosecutor; Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York; and Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney in Brooklyn. Mr. Patrick on Thursday said that it was not the right time for him to take such a job. White House officials said that Mr. Obama had not yet decided on a successor, with one official saying the president was ''a long way'' from an announcement. In a ceremony in the State Dining Room on Thursday, Mr. Obama said Mr. Holder had promised to stay in his job until a successor was confirmed. ''I chose him to serve as attorney general because he believes, as I do, that justice is not just an abstract theory -- it's a living and breathing principle,'' Mr. Obama said, adding that Mr. Holder used the law to improve people's lives. ''That's why I made him America's lawyer, the people's lawyer.''

Racial exploitation is now the powerful, conventional challenge to emerging discourses on alternative methodologies of procuring organs, especially markets. Yet, to what effect? Those committed to providing equitable opportunities to suffering patients must ask whether challenges to organ markets benefit patients, especially racial minorities? Reduced waitlists? Resolved racial disparities in organ allocation? These questions are relevant to any discussion about equity, access, and class in organ procurement and allocation in the United States. The evidence, including growing waitlists and thousands of deaths each year, informs us that altruistic organ procurement remains an ineffective approach to meet the growing demand for organs. Race becomes the dominant cover or proxy to justify exclusive reliance on altruism in organ procurement. The problem here is that race-based claims against organ markets serve to destabilize any discourse that might involve racial minorities contributing in non-altruistic ways to organ pools. Race plays as an expedient trope here, masking concerns that may be driven by other interests far removed from minority status, class, and access. To be sure, there is a tremendous demand for organs in America, and the situation is worsening. As of August 15, 2007, there were 96,928 patients on the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) waitlist. 4 That number represents an increase of 400 patients in less than three months. Over 6000 of these patients will die before receiving an organ, and thousands of others will be unceremoniously removed from the waitlist because they are no longer attractive candidates, being too sick, weak, or old according to those who set the rationing priorities. Disproportionately, these individuals are African Americans, stuck in a strange quagmire, where policymakers expect strangers to donate organs and rescue them. This normative approach is utilitarian in theory, and although intended to equalize transplantation opportunities, it provides verylittle relief to vulnerable patients. One significant complication in the utilitarian ordering of transplantation is the reliance on blind compassion. Another complication with that normative approach is that it refuses to consider the pragmatic or realistic ordering of collectives, including competing value systems and group biases. In essence it demands the surrendering of lives or organs, in this case with a promise for later returns. Yet, those goals must be understood as aspirational, with very little hope of imminent achievement. If more Americans believed that communal sacrifice is returned in equal measure they would readily surrender their organs at procurement sites throughout the United States. But they do not. This Article does not argue against the value of aspirational thinking. To the contrary, the creation of just rules and regulations and the testing of those rules through a reliable, fair, and unbiased judicial system form an ideal that we strive for in our legal system.",4026.0,"<h4>Thus, the shortage disproportionately impacts Blacks  </h4><p><strong>Jefferson-Jones  13</strong>    Jamila Jefferson-Jones, J.D., Harvard Law School, Assistant Professor of Law at Barry University's Dwayne O.

743197,A new liberal is key- Holder’s actions weren’t enough,Reuters 9/26,"Reuters 9/26/2014 (For Obama, Eric Holder's Exit Leaves A Void On Civil Rights Issues, reprinted in the Huffington Post, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/26/obama-eric-holder_n_5886950.html)","The departure of Holder deprives the administration of a powerful voice on civil rights advocates fear his exit leaves a hard-to-fill hole on Obama's team They are worried that his work on voting rights, sentencing reform, and addressing racial profiling measures used by police could fall by the wayside We've always seen him as an important spokesperson for the administration and that role should not go unfulfilled."" Holder acknowledged that ""work remains to be done Holder has asked federal prosecutors not to seek mandatory minimum sentences to be used when charging defendants in low-level drug cases Holder announced earlier this year that the department would review applications for executive clemency - another project that is under way but unfinished","advocates fear his exit leaves a hard-to-fill hole They are worried that his work on voting rights, sentencing reform, and addressing racial profiling measures used by police could fall by the wayside important spokesperson for the administration and that role should not go unfulfilled work remains to be done asked federal prosecutors not to seek mandatory minimum sentences to be used when charging defendants in low-level drug case executive clemency - another project that is under way but unfinished","The departure of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder deprives the Obama administration of a powerful voice on civil rights at a time when riots in Ferguson, Missouri, have thrust the issue into the spotlight. Civil rights advocates fear his exit leaves a hard-to-fill hole on Obama's team when it comes to events such as in Ferguson - where days of protests followed the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black teenager - and challenging laws in some states requiring voters to show photo identification, measures that Holder has said would prevent black and Latino voters from going to the polls. They are worried that his work on voting rights, sentencing reform, and addressing racial profiling measures used by police could fall by the wayside when his yet-to-be-determined successor sets a new set of priorities - particularly as the administration focuses on counterterrorism and the threat posed by Islamic State militants. ""We always thought that he was able to say the things that Obama could not say,"" said Barbara Arnwine, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights. ""We've always seen him as an important spokesperson for the administration and that role should not go unfulfilled."" BONDS THAT GO 'MUCH DEEPER' In a speech choked with emotion on Thursday, Holder recounted how he had been part of Team Obama since his friend was a ""young senator from Illinois"" making ""an improbable, idealistic effort"" to become president. Obama stuck with Holder even as he became a lightning rod for Republican criticism of his administration. ""We have been great colleagues, but the bonds between us are much deeper than that. In good times and in bad, in things personal and in things professional, you have been there for me,"" Holder said to Obama. Over the years, both men have spoken about racism they have experienced in their own lives. Before he became the nation's first black president, Obama wrote ""Dreams from My Father,"" a memoir on racial identity. But since taking office, he has often shied away from talking publicly about race. By contrast, Holder - who worked for the NAACP legal defense fund early in his career - has been more outspoken. His sister-in-law, Vivian Malone Jones, became a hero in the desegregation movement of the 1960s after she was blocked from entering the University of Alabama when she arrived for classes. ""I think in his own way, using his role as Attorney General, Holder has addressed issues that remain off-limits,"" said Wade Henderson, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

Desperate for new products and new customers as social and legal attitudes toward cigarette smoking have changed in recent decades, e-cigarettes and legal pot could be throwing a lifeline to Big Tobacco, which already boasts the marketing expertise and regulatory savvy to take advantage of the opportunity. “Bottom line, the long-held investor perception of tobacco as a sunset industry is wrong,” said David Sealy, senior equity research analyst at the Boston Co. and author of an analysis released Wednesday of the changes sweeping the industry. The major tobacco companies, including RJ Reynolds, Lorillard and Altria Group, the parent company of Philip Morris USA, are poised to benefit from these “potential game-changers for the growth-challenged tobacco industry.” The new products and market opportunities are arriving just in time, Mr. Sealy said, as its core cigarette business slowly declines. “It’s only a matter of time before it goes away,” he said. Mr. Sealy said it is no longer an industry that rolls tobacco, but an industry that provides nicotine. Discussion over the saving powers of e-cigarettes and marijuana to the tobacco industry comes at a time when industry officials, investors and consumers are watching what regulations, if any, the Food and Drug Administration will place on e-cigarettes. With regulations in mind, the report says the $3 billion e-cigarette market is only going to grow and become more of a substantial player in the tobacco industry. The legalization of marijuana will become an option for tobacco companies as well. “Quantifying the exact change will depend on regulator response, but anyone not thinking about these related opportunities will miss an inflection in one of the world’s largest and oldest consumer businesses,” Mr. Sealy said in the report. Moving away from nicotine, The Boston Co. report brings another debated drug into the picture as a viable product to sustain tobacco industries: marijuana. Sixteen states have decriminalized marijuana use, 20 states have allowed medical marijuana use and Colorado and Washington have fully legalized marijuana use. Mr. Sealy said these trends, plus polling that cites 58 percent of Americans support marijuana legalization, signal “snowballing” to move toward national legalization. “The momentum behind marijuana legalization has not been lost on the marketplace. To date, the market has focused mostly on speculative small caps, but if legalization becomes official federal policy, Big Tobacco will end up dominating the marijuana market,” he said in the report. But the focus of a savior to the tobacco industry remains on e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes started with small entrepreneurial businesses that often sell over the Internet, but Big Tobacco, or the handful of major tobacco companies, are ready to capitalize on the device that delivers nicotine through vapor. One of these top tobacco companies, Lorillard, has developed Blu eCigs, a brand of e-cigarettes that boasts 50 percent of the U.S. e-cigarette market. In the company’s 2013 annual financial report, net sales increased by 4.9 percent because of an increase in both traditional and electronic cigarettes. Lorillard’s traditional cigarettes such as Newport and Maverick increased in net sales by $158 million. The net sales of their e-cigarettes increased even more, by $169 million. But not all analysts and tobacco companies are encouraged by the e-cigarette craze. A report out this week by Moody’s Investors Service said e-cigarettes will not have a significant impact on the tobacco industry in the next couple of years because the product makes up only 1 percent to 2 percent of the total U.S. tobacco market. “Despite the excitement about the category and its extraordinary growth, we believe that the earnings contribution will be quite modest over the near term,” said Nancy Meadows, vice president and senior analyst of Moody’s Investors Service corporate finance group.",4072.0,"<h4>Tobacco companies are collapsing now- federal marijuana legalization revives them</h4><p><strong>Washington Times 2014</strong> (4/16, With pot and e-cigarettes, Big Tobacco is just waiting to inhale emerging markets, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/apr/16/with-pot-and-e-cigarettes-big-tobacco-is-just-wait/?page=all)</p><p>Electronic cigarettes and <u><mark>marijuana could prove a vital breath of fresh air for the nation’s fading tobacco industry. <strong>Desperate for new products</u></strong></mark> and new customers as social and legal attitudes toward cigarette smoking have changed in recent decades, e-cigarettes and <u><mark>legal pot could be <strong>throwing a lifeline to Big Tobacco</u></strong></mark>, <u>which</u> already <u>boasts</u> <u>the</u> marketing <u><mark>expertise</u></mark> and regulatory savvy <u><mark>to take advantage of the opportunity. </u>“B</mark>ottom line, the long-held investor perception of tobacco as a sunset industry is wrong,” said David Sealy, senior equity research analyst at the Boston Co. and author of an analysis released Wednesday of the changes sweeping the industry.

Such rapid change resonates throughout the social body, appearing to threaten to disrupt the perceived social fabric and its associated norms. The threat and experience of this social rupture provokes considerable anxieties on the part of certain groups, who seek to control the social order in order to preserve hegemonic forms of power relations.9 During such periods of flux, issues of problematic consumption (alcohol, gambling, and prostitution) and dangerous identities have been convenient and familiar `targets' for programmes and campaigns of moral regulation.10 Prostitution, which combines both of these elements, thus appears throughout history as `a dense signifier around which a variety of social anxieties' can be expressed.11 Thus, during the intense social and economic transformation which characterized the Victorian era, moral panics around syphilis, venereal disease, and an imagined `white slavery trade'12 expressed wider cultural anxieties over the overlapping processes of urbanization, immigration, and women's shifting roles. Encouraged by a broad coalition of feminists and religious groups who had made saving fallen women their mission, the Contagious Diseases Acts of 1864, 1866, and 1869 constructed the prostitute as morally and physically dangerous and vulnerable, justifying the intensive moral, social, and legal regulation of many unmarried working-class women.13 In so doing, the public's individual moral and social health appeared to be secured, helping to consolidate a particular image of the nation state as healthy and enlightened, all of which facilitated its colonial expansion. As Burton notes, the spectre of sexual slavery employed in campaigns and reforms at this time operated to conceal their facilitation of a wider colonialist project.14 This parallels with the present late-modern period and the dynamics of globalization which provide much of the impetus behind the recent flurry of legislative activity in international prostitution laws. Here the major shifts and increased fluidity in the movement of people, capital, and commodities brought about by globalization and late-capitalist restructuring, alongside a burgeoning sex industry, have incited a similar broad coalition of the religious right, moral puritans, and radical feminists around an abolitionist mission.15 This modern `unholy' alliance has coalesced around a crusade to combat what it regards as `modern sexual slavery', a term applied variously to the `trafficking' of women and girls for purposes of prostitution and to commercial sex more generally. `Saving fallen women' has returned to the policy frame, yet while there is continuity with the earlier nineteenth-century campaigns, its reappearance relates to a new global economic and political context and invokes new forms of governance.16 Once again, the trafficked bodies of sex workers provide a useful metaphor for violated state boundaries and act as a trope for a more general politics of security:17 the putative re-emergence of the `white slave trade' triggered multiple initiatives intended to protect the sovereign spaces of the European Union as much as the sovereign bodies of women.18 The form these multiple initiatives have taken is contingent upon different political traditions and arrangements, meaning that the same forces (that is, globalization) have been the impetus behind what are often cast as opposing regulatory frameworks, the most notable being efforts to criminalize men in Sweden and to legalize voluntary sex work in the Netherlands.19",4017.0,"<h4>Specifically, their “health” and “safety” regulations in the Kuo evidence are weak pretexts for expansive regulations of sex workers’ lives- leads to race and class hierarchies and replicates the problems of criminalization</h4><p><strong>Scoular 10, </strong>Jane, Professor of Law at University of Strathclyde, March 2010, “What's Law Got To Do With it?

Encouraged by a broad coalition of feminists and religious groups who had made saving fallen women their mission, <u><mark>the Contagious Diseases Acts</u></mark> of 1864, 1866, and 1869 <u><mark>constructed the prostitute as morally and physically </mark>dangerous and <mark>vulnerable, justifying</u></mark> the <u><mark>intensive</u></mark> mo<u><strong><mark>ral, social, and legal regulation</u></strong></mark> of many unmarried working-class women.13 In so doing, <u><mark>the public's</u></mark> individual moral and social <u><mark>health appeared to be secured, helping to consolidate a</mark> particular <mark>image of the nation state as healthy and enlightened</mark>,</u> all of <u><mark>which facilitated its colonial expansion.</u></mark> As Burton notes, the spectre of sexual slavery employed in campaigns and reforms at this time operated to conceal their facilitation of a wider colonialist project.14 <u><mark>This parallels with</mark> the <mark>present</u></mark> late-modern period <u>and</u> the dynamics of globalization which provide much of the impetus behind <u>the recent flurry of legislative activity in</u> international <u><mark>prostitution laws.</u></mark> Here the major shifts and increased fluidity in the movement of people, capital, and commodities brought about by globalization and late-capitalist restructuring, alongside a burgeoning sex industry, have incited a similar broad coalition of the religious right, moral puritans, and radical feminists around an abolitionist mission.15 <u>This modern `unholy' alliance has coalesced around a crusade to combat</u> what it regards as <u>`modern sexual slavery',</u> a term applied variously to the `trafficking' of women and girls for purposes of prostitution and to commercial sex more generally. `Saving fallen women' has returned to the policy frame, yet while there is continuity with the earlier nineteenth-century campaigns, its reappearance relates to a new global economic and political context and invokes new forms of governance.16 Once again, <u><mark>the trafficked bodies of sex workers provide a useful metaphor for violated state boundaries</mark> and act as a trope for a more general politics of security</u>:17 the putative re-emergence of the `white slave trade' triggered multiple initiatives intended to protect the sovereign spaces of the European Union as much as the sovereign bodies of women.18<u> </u>The form these multiple initiatives have taken is contingent upon different political traditions and arrangements, meaning that <u><mark>the</u> <u>same forces</u></mark> (that is, globalization) <u><mark>have been the impetus behind</u></mark> what are often cast as opposing regulatory frameworks, the most notable being <u><mark>efforts to</u></mark> criminalize men in Sweden and to <u><mark>legalize</mark> <mark>voluntary sex work</mark> in the Netherlands.</u>19</p>",1nc,,3,430336,3,17105,./documents/ndtceda14/Dartmouth/YaAh/Dartmouth-Yan-Ahmad-Neg-Navy-Round5.docx,565266,N,Navy,5,James Madison Lepp-Miller,McElhinny,"T 2NR

Republican leaders have not yet finalized their legislative schedule, but the bipartisan Iran proposal is supported by incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and all of his leadership team. And taking a confrontational stance toward Iran as diplomatic negotiations continue with a group of Western nations appears to be top of mind for the new Senate Republican majority. “It’s an important issue, a priority, and has wide bipartisan support in the Senate,” said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart on Monday. The Republican House overwhelmingly passed a sanctions bill targeting Iran’s energy industry in 2013, though that legislation was never taken up by the Senate. The Kirk-Menendez legislation would tighten economic sanctions on Iran if the country walks away from ongoing negotiations over nuclear enrichment or reneges on an interim agreement that has frozen some of Iran’s nuclear activities in return for unwinding some sanctions. In November, Western and Iranians negotiators extended that interim deal until July as they attempt to hammer out a permanent deal that would curtail Iran’s nuclear ambitions and relax sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy and isolated the country globally. A separate bill written by Graham and incoming Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) would require Congress to approve of any final deal and could figure into the GOP’s plans next year. “You will see a very vigorous Congress when it comes to Iran. You will see a Congress making sure that sanctions are real and will be reimposed at the drop of a hat.

The effect is that the later court is free not to follow a precedent
The law will be regarded as learning that cases are ‘distinguishable’ is a staple no lawyer would be competent who did not appreciate that the law was not to be identified simply with the ratio of an earlier decision","An integral part of legal reasoning using precedents is the practice of distinguishing. Distinguishing involves a precedent not being followed even though the facts of the later case fall within the scope of the ratio of the earlier case. As the later case falls within the scope of the earlier ratio (i.e., within the scope of the rule), one might expect that the decision in the later case must be the same (unless the court has the power to overrule the earlier case and decides to do so). In legal reasoning using precedents, however, the later court is free not to follow the earlier case by pointing to some difference in the facts between the two cases, even though those facts do not feature in the ratio of the earlier case.
Take the trust example: in a later case the recipient of trust property may not have paid for the property, but may have relied on the receipt in entering into another arrangement (e.g. in using the property as security for a loan). The later court may hold that the recipient is entitled to retain the property and justify its decision by ruling that where (i) the defendant has received trust property (ii) in breach of trust and (iii) has not paid for the property, but has (vii) relied upon the receipt to disadvantageously alter her position, then the defendant is entitled to retain the property. (This result would still leave the beneficiary with a claim against the trustee for the value of the property.)
The effect of distinguishing, then, is that the later court is free not to follow a precedent that, prima facie, applies to it, by making a ruling which is narrower than that made in the precedent case. The only formal constraints on the later court are that: (1) in formulating the ratio of the later case, the factors in the ratio of the earlier case (i.e., (i)–(iii)) must be retained, and (2) the ruling in the later case must be such that it would still support the result reached in the precedent case. In short, the ruling in the second case must not be inconsistent with the result in the precedent case, but the court is otherwise free to make a ruling narrower than that in the precedent. Hence the more accurate statements of the doctrine of precedent are to the effect that a later court must either follow or distinguish a binding precedent—a disjunctive obligation.
At a formal level the practice of distinguishing can be reconciled with the view that rationes are rules by arguing that later courts have the power to modify the rule in the earlier case. An analogy can be drawn to the power to overrule earlier decisions: just as judges can overrule earlier cases, they can also modify earlier law, thereby paralleling the power of legislators to either repeal or amend the law. The analogy, however, is very imperfect. There are two difficulties: (a) Common Lawyers do not conceptualise overruling and distinguishing in this parallel way, and (b) the rationale for a power with this particular scope is unclear.
On the first point, Common Lawyers ordinarily think of precedents as constituting the law up and until they are overruled. Once overruled the later decision is (normally) given retroactive effect, so the law is changed for the past as well as the future. But when a case is distinguished it is not often thought that the law was one thing until the later decision of a court, and now another thing. The law will be regarded prior to the later decision as already subject to various distinctions not mentioned by the earlier court. Indeed part of the skill of a good common lawyer is grasping the law as not stated by the earlier court: learning that cases are ‘distinguishable’ is a staple part of common law education, and no common lawyer would be competent who did not appreciate that the law was not to be identified simply with the ratio of an earlier decision. Common lawyers do not, then, conceptualise distinguishing along lines analogous to overruling.",3938.0,"<h4>Establishes the same precedent – every lawyer votes neg</h4><p><strong>LAMOND 14 University Lecturer in Legal Philosophy and the Felix Frankfurter Fellow in Law, Balliol College</strong> [Grant Lamond, ""Precedent and Analogy in Legal Reasoning"", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N.

The only formal constraints on the later court are that: (1) in formulating the ratio of the later case, the factors in the ratio of the earlier case (i.e., (i)–(iii)) must be retained, and (2) the ruling in the later case must be such that it would still support the result reached in the precedent case. In short, the ruling in the second case must not be inconsistent with the result in the precedent case, but the court is otherwise free to make a ruling narrower than that in the precedent. <u>Hence</u> the more accurate statements of the doctrine of precedent are to the effect that <u>a later court must either follow or distinguish a binding precedent</u>—a disjunctive obligation.</p><p>At a formal level the practice of distinguishing can be reconciled with the view that rationes are rules by arguing that later courts have the power to modify the rule in the earlier case. An analogy can be drawn to the power to overrule earlier decisions: just as judges can overrule earlier cases, they can also modify earlier law, thereby paralleling the power of legislators to either repeal or amend the law. The analogy, however, is very imperfect. There are two difficulties: (a) Common Lawyers do not conceptualise overruling and distinguishing in this parallel way, and (b) the rationale for a power with this particular scope is unclear.</p><p>On the first point, Common Lawyers ordinarily think of precedents as constituting the law up and until they are overruled. Once overruled the later decision is (normally) given retroactive effect, so the law is changed for the past as well as the future. But <u>when a case is distinguished it is not often thought that the law was one thing until the later decision of a court, and now another thing</u>. <u><mark>The law will be regarded</u></mark> prior to the later decision <u><mark>as</u></mark> already <u>subject to various distinctions </u>not mentioned by the earlier court. Indeed part of the skill of a good common lawyer is grasping the law as not stated by the earlier court: <u><strong><mark>learning that cases are ‘distinguishable’ is a staple</strong></mark> part of common law education, and <mark>no</mark> common <mark>lawyer would be competent who did not appreciate that the law was not to be identified</mark> <mark>simply with the ratio of an earlier decision</mark>.</u> Common lawyers do not, then, conceptualise distinguishing along lines analogous to overruling.</p>",2NC,CP – distinguish,2nc solvency,431206,2,17117,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/DeBo/Emory-Dean-Bontha-Neg-D6seceda-Round1.docx,565425,N,D6seceda,1,Miami George-Silverman,Slattery,Organ sales aff 2NR politics distinguish grounds CP organ conscription CP,ndtceda14/Emory/DeBo/Emory-Dean-Bontha-Neg-D6seceda-Round1.docx,,48463,DeBo,Emory DeBo,,Be.....,De.....,Ni.....,Bo.....,18765,Emory,Emory,,,1004,ndtceda14,NDT/CEDA 2014-15,2014,cx,college,2

An unspoken (and perhaps unidentified) effect of any drug legalization system is to transfer a significant portion of these social costs to the private sector employers in the form of larger and more frequent judgments rendered and fines imposed for the torts and crimes committed by employees under the influence of drugs, and of productivity costs of treatment and rehabilitation efforts required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

It must be consistent with the political philosophy and principles upon which this country was founded-liberty, democracy, private ownership of property and a free market.

When is the Internet going to collapse? The answer is NEVER. The Internet is amazing for no other reason than that it hasn't simply collapsed, never to be rebooted. Over a decade ago, many pundits were predicting an all-out catastrophic failure, and back then the load was nothing compared with what it is today. So how much more can this network take? Let's look at the basic changes that have occurred since the Net became chat-worthy around 1990. First of all, only a few people were on the Net back in 1990, since it was essentially a carrier for e-mail (spam free!), newsgroups, gopher, and FTP. These capabilities remain. But the e-mail load has grown to phenomenal proportions and become burdened with megatons of spam. In one year, the amount of spam can exceed a decade's worth, say 1990 to 2000, of all Internet traffic. It's actually the astonishing overall growth of the Internet that is amazing. In 1990, the total U.S. backbone throughput of the Internet was 1 terabyte, and in 1991 it doubled to 2TB. Throughput continued to double until 1996, when it jumped to 1,500TB. After that huge jump, it returned to doubling, reaching 80,000 to 140,000TB in 2002. This ridiculous growth rate has continued as more and more services are added to the burden. The jump in 1996 is attributable to the one-two punch of the universal popularization of the Web and the introduction of the MP3 standard and subsequent music file sharing. More recently, the emergence of inane video clips (YouTube and the rest) as universal entertainment has continued to slam the Net with overhead, as has large video file sharing via BitTorrent and other systems. Then VoIP came along, and IPTV is next. All the while, e-mail numbers are in the trillions of messages, and spam has never been more plentiful and bloated. Add blogging, vlogging, and twittering and it just gets worse. According to some expensive studies, the growth rate has begun to slow down to something like 50 percent per year. But that's growth on top of huge numbers. Petabytes. So when does this thing just grind to a halt or blow up? To date, we have to admit that the structure of the Net is robust, to say the least. This is impressive, considering the fact that experts were predicting a collapse in the 1990s. Robust or not, this Internet is a transportation system. It transports data. All transportation systems eventually need upgrading, repair, basic changes, or reinvention. But what needs to be done here? This, to me, has come to be the big question. Does anything at all need to be done, or do we run it into the ground and then fix it later? Is this like a jalopy leaking oil and water about to blow, or an organic perpetual-motion machine that fixes itself somehow? Many believe that the Net has never collapsed because it does tend to fix itself. A decade ago we were going to run out of IP addresses—remember? It righted itself, with rotating addresses and subnets. Many of the Net's improvements are self-improvements. Only spam, viruses, and spyware represent incurable diseases that could kill the organism. I have to conclude that the worst-case scenario for the Net is an outage here or there, if anywhere. After all, the phone system, a more machine-intensive system, never really imploded after years and years of growth, did it? While it has outages, it's actually more reliable than the power grid it sits on. Why should the Internet be any different now that it is essentially run by phone companies who know how to keep networks up? And let's be real here.

But it can only hope to have an emancipatory effect if it considers its own critical standpoints and the alternative social arrangements they imply. Unfortunately it rarely does this, with the result that its stand- points and implicit alternatives are often contradictory, infeasible, or undesirable even if they are feasible. Marxist-influenced work still bears the traces of the tension between the standpoints of a socialist or communist society which has pre-industrial communitarian qualities and one in which the forces of production are developed beyond current levels of industrialization. More generally, there is a strong modernist tendency in which it is assumed that problems can be progressively unravelled without creating new ones at the same time, as if eventually all trade-offs or dilemmas could be overcome through a triumph of reason. We shall argue through substantive examples that such optimism is not only misplaced but likely to be counterproductive, limiting  progress. There are always likely to be 'dilemmas of development' (Toye, 1987. The problem of critical standpoints has become more acute in recent years, indeed it is central to the crisis of the Left. There is no longer asingle standpoint or alternative (socialism/communism) counterposed to a single, overarching target (capitalism). Now there are many targets -patriarchy, racism, homophobia, militarism, industrialism - and corre- spondingly many critical standpoints with complex relations between them. That critical social science is no longer seen as synonymous with a socialist perspective is a sign of considerable progress, and cause for optimism too, as failure on the traditional front of class politics is compensated by progress on other, newer fronts such as the politics of gender. But it is also a source of heightened uncertainty. While there was always a problem of inconsistencies between critical standpoints, it has deepened and widened with the rise of 'green' concerns, for they bring into question the feasibility and desirability of non-capitalist as well as capitalist industrial societies. Is the problem capitalism, industrial society in general, or modernity?; and what are the alterna- tives? Equally, increasing awareness of problems of ethnocentrism and value pluralism throws doubt over the familiar, implicit critical stand- points of Western radical social science. How do we decide what is a problem? What if we cannot reach a consensus on this? Until recently, it seemed that the problems or targets of critical social science could be relied upon to emerge from the investigation of existing practices, where one would encounter the felt needs, frustrations and suffering of actors, and in discovering the sources of these problems, work out what changes would lead towards emancipation (e.g. Fay, 1975, 1987; Collier, 1994h(. This was coupled with an implicit view that emancipation was a form of escape from domination, illusion and unwanted constraints, with little or no acknowledgement that it depended on the construction of superior, alternative, progressive frameworks which could replace the old ones. But it is now increasingly apparent that normative questions of possible alternatives and what is good or bad about them cannot be evaded. How, without addressing such questions, could one decide what constitutes a superior alternative? Should there be a presumption in favour of community as a basis of social organiz- ation over other forms? Does liberalism provide the best framework for multicultural societies? What should be people's rights and responsibili- ties? What are our responsibilities to distant others, future generations, and to other species? There is little hope of achieving the goal of an emancipatory social science if it shuns normative discussions of issues such as these.",4058.0,"<h4>Radical economic kritiks must provide specific alternatives to existing economic methods.

While there was always a problem of inconsistencies between critical standpoints, it has deepened and widened with the rise of 'green' concerns, for they bring into question the feasibility and desirability of non-capitalist as well as capitalist industrial societies. Is the problem capitalism, industrial society in general, or modernity?; and what are the alterna- tives? Equally, increasing awareness of problems of ethnocentrism and value pluralism throws doubt over the familiar, implicit critical stand- points of Western radical social science. How do we decide what is a problem? What if we cannot reach a consensus on this? Until recently, it seemed that the problems or targets of critical social science could be relied upon to emerge from the investigation of existing practices, where one would encounter the felt needs, frustrations and suffering of actors, and in discovering the sources of these problems, work out what changes would lead towards emancipation (e.g. Fay, 1975, 1987; Collier, 1994h(. <u><mark>This was coupled with an implicit view that emancipation was a form of escape from domination</u></mark>, <u>illusion </u>and unwanted constraints, <u><mark>with little</mark> </u>or no <u><mark>acknowledgement that it depended on the construction of superior, alternative</u>, </mark>progressive <u><mark>frameworks</mark> which could replace the old ones</u>. But it is now increasingly apparent that <u>normative questions of possible alternatives and what is good or bad about them <strong>cannot be evaded</u></strong>. <u>How, without addressing such questions, could one decide what constitutes a superior alternative</u>? <u>Should there be a presumption in favour of community </u>as a basis of social organiz- ation over other forms? <u>Does liberalism provide the best framework </u>for multicultural societies? What should be people's rights and responsibili- ties? What are our responsibilities to distant others, future generations, and to other species? <u><mark>There is <strong>little hope of achieving the goal of an emancipatory social science</strong> if it shuns normative discussions of issues</u></mark> such as these.</p>",2NC,Law k,Excluding the supernatural,51351,72,17118,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/DeBo/Emory-Dean-Bontha-Neg-Gsu-Round1.docx,565420,N,Gsu,1,West Georgia Muhammad-Gaius,Deming,"1NC T occidentalism K law good K impact turns

What we live in now is known as an interglacial, a relatively brief period between long ice ages. Unfortunately for us, most interglacial periods last only about ten thousand years, and that is how long it has been since the last Ice Age ended. How much longer do we have before the ice begins to spread across the Earth’s surface? Less than a hundred years or several hundred? We simply don’t know. Even if all the temperature increase over the last century is attributable to human activities, the rise has been relatively modest one of a little over one degree Fahrenheit — an increase well within natural variations over the last few thousand years. While an enduring temperature rise of the same size over the next century would cause humanity to make some changes, it would undoubtedly be within our ability to adapt. Entering a new ice age, however, would be catastrophic for the continuation of modern civilization. One has only to look at maps showing the extent of the great ice sheets during the last Ice Age to understand what a return to ice age conditions would mean. Much of Europe and North-America were covered by thick ice, thousands of feet thick in many areas and the world as a whole was much colder. The last “little” Ice Age started as early as the 14th century when the Baltic Sea froze over followed by unseasonable cold, storms, and a rise in the level of the Caspian Sea. That was followed by the extinction of the Norse settlements in Greenland and the loss of grain cultivation in Iceland. Harvests were even severely reduced in Scandinavia And this was a mere foreshadowing of the miseries to come. By the mid-17th century, glaciers in the Swiss Alps advanced, wiping out farms and entire villages. In England, the River Thames froze during the winter, and in 1780, New York Harbor froze. Had this continued, history would have been very different. Luckily, the decrease in solar activity that caused the Little Ice Age ended and the result was the continued flowering of modern civilization. There were very few Ice Ages until about 2.75 million years ago when Earth’s climate entered an unusual period of instability. Starting about a million years ago cycles of ice ages lasting about 100,000 years, separated by relatively short interglacial perioods, like the one we are now living in became the rule. Before the onset of the Ice Ages, and for most of the Earth’s history, it was far warmer than it is today. Indeed, the Sun has been getting brighter over the whole history of the Earth and large land plants have flourished. Both of these had the effect of dropping carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere to the lowest level in Earth’s long history. Five hundred million years ago, carbon dioxide concentrations were over 13 times current levels; and not until about 20 million years ago did carbon dioxide levels dropped to a little less than twice what they are today. It is possible that moderately increased carbon dioxide concentrations could extend the current interglacial period. But we have not reached the level required yet, nor do we know the optimum level to reach. So, rather than call for arbitrary limits on carbon dioxide emissions, perhaps the best thing the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the climatology community in general could do is spend their efforts on determining the optimal range of carbon dioxide needed to extend the current interglacial period indefinitely. NASA has predicted that the solar cycle peaking in 2022 could be one of the weakest in centuries and should cause a very significant cooling of Earth’s climate. Will this be the trigger that initiates a new Ice Age?

Why? Because it takes a lot of effort to figure out new vulnerabilities in already protected critical systems and the effects
of an attack are difficult to predict, including blowback on the perpetrators. More importantly, they note, “There is no strategic reason why an aggressor would limit themselves to only one class of weaponry.” In a real war, cyberattacks would be an adjunct to conventional efforts to blow up critical infrastructure. Because attacks can be launched from any set of computers, attackers can remain hidden. Consequently, a strategy of deterrence will not work in cyberwarfare because the target for retaliation is unknown. This means that resilience is the main defense against cyberweapons, a combination of preventive measures and contingency plans for a quick post-attack recovery. If cyberwarfare against infrastructure was easy, terrorists like Al Qaeda would have already tried the tactic against us and our NATO allies. Brown and Sommer observe that the Internet and the physical telecommunications infrastructure were designed to be robust and self-healing, so that failures in one part are routed around. “You have to be cautious when hearing from people engaging in fear-mongering about huge blackouts and collapses of critical infrastructures via the Internet,” says University of Toronto cyberwarfare expert Ronald Deibert in the January/February 2011 issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. “There is a lot of redundancy in the networks; it’s not a simple thing to turn off the power grid.” In addition, our experience with current forms of malware is somewhat reassuring. Responses to new malware have generally been found and made available within days and few denial of service attacks have lasted more than a day. In addition, many critical networks such as those carrying financial transactions are not connected to the Internet requiring insider information to make them vulnerable. While not everyone uses up-to-date malware detection, most government agencies, major businesses, and many individuals do, which means that would-be attackers must take the time and effort to find new flaws and develop new techniques. For example, the success of the Stuxnet worm that attacked and disabled Iranian nuclear centrifuges required very extensive intelligence gathering and knowledge of specific software flaws as well as someone able to walk into the facilities with an infected USB drive. Brown and Sommers urge governments to ratify the CyberCrime Convention. The chief treaty holdouts are Russia and China, countries from which many recent cyberattacks appear to have originated. “We should not forget that many of the countries that are havens for cybercrime have invested billions in domestic communications monitoring to supplement an already extensive set of police tools for political control,” notes James Lewis. “The notion that a cybercriminal in one of these countries operates without the knowledge and thus tacit consent of the government is difficult to accept. A hacker who turned his sights from Tallinn to the Kremlin would have only hours before his service were cut off, his door was smashed down and his computer confiscated.” Another fruitful way to address emerging cyber threats suggested by the authors is to strengthen connections between national Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs). CERT experts operate as a kind of early warning system who also devise software fixes to stop the spread of new malware. And they think that public policy, including procurement, can be used to encourage the development of properly tested hardware and software.

The only way to achieve real energy security is to reengineer not just our energy economy but that of the entire world.","Given America's reliance on imported oil, it seems safe to assume that if we succeeded in getting such dramatic reductions, whatever sacrifices we'd made would be more than compensated for by our new immunity to the nastiness of world oil markets. Let Saudi Arabia cut its production. Let Hugo Chávez sell his oil to China. Such maneuvers no longer matter to Fortress America. And yet, no country can really hope to improve its energy security by acting alone. True, cutting our own oil use would bring great things here at home, everything from cleaner air and water to lower noise pollution. But we'd be surprised by how little our domestic reductions changed the rest of the world—or improved our overall energy security. The first problem, once again, is the small-planet nature of energy. America may be the biggest user of oil, but the price we pay is determined by global demand, and demand is being driven largely by booming Asia, which is only too happy to burn any barrel we manage to conserve or replace. Second, any shift to alternatives or better efficiency will take years and perhaps decades to implement. The U.S. car fleet, for example, turns over at a rate of just eight percent a year. That's as fast as consumers can afford to buy new cars and manufacturers can afford to make them, which means that—even in a fantasy scenario where the cars were already designed, the factories retooled, and the workers retrained—it would still take 12 years to deploy a greener fleet. Most forecasts fail to acknowledge how slowly such changes could actually occur. Sure, if the United States could cut its oil consumption overnight by 9 million barrels, or 6.5 million barrels, or even 3.6 million barrels, it would have a staggering impact on oil prices. But barring a global depression, demand won't ever drop so rapidly; instead, our demand reductions will be incremental and thus effectively canceled out by the expected demand growth in other, less efficiency-minded countries like China. Berkeley's Borenstein, for example, estimates that the 3.6 million barrels the United States would save by 2030 under the 2007 energy bill will be more than offset by growth in demand elsewhere. Put another way, we could all squeeze into smaller cars and still be paying $4 for a gallon of gasoline. To be sure, energy security isn't defined solely by cheap energy, and in fact, a great many enviros and energy wonks like oil at $100 a barrel, as it seems to be the only thing keeping more of us from buying Hummers. But high prices are killing our other energy-security objectives. High prices mean that money is still flowing into rogue states. High oil prices also imply tight oil markets, prone to massive price swings that are painful for consumers and make it virtually impossible for companies and governments to forecast their future energy costs—and so correctly gauge how much to invest in next-generation energy technologies. And no matter how clean and carbon free the United States becomes, if China and India are still burning massive volumes of oil we haven't done much to improve long-term security of any kind. The only way to achieve real energy security is to reengineer not just our energy economy but that of the entire world. Oil prices won't fall, evil regimes won't be bankrupt, and sustainability won't be possible—until global oil demand is slowed. And outside of an economic meltdown, the only way it can be is if the tools we deploy to improve our own security can be somehow exported to other countries, and especially developing countries. Energy globalism doesn't mean that every new energy gadget or fuel we invent has to work in Beijing or Burkina Faso. It does, however, suggest that our current energy strategy, tailored primarily to our own markets and our own technical capabilities, will be next to useless in an energy economy that is increasingly global—and that at least some of our energy investments should be compatible with regions where natural resources are strained, governments are poor, and consumers don't have access to home-equity lines of credit",4100.0,"<h4>One country can’t solve warming alone</h4><p><strong><mark>Roberts, 8</strong></mark> – economist (Paul, “The Seven Myths of Energy Independence,” June, 2008, Paul is an American economist and a columnist for Creators Syndicate.

But high prices are killing our other energy-security objectives. High prices mean that money is still flowing into rogue states. <u>High oil prices also imply tight oil markets, prone to massive price swings that are painful for consumers and make it virtually impossible for companies and governments to forecast their future energy costs—and so correctly gauge how much to invest in next-generation energy tech</u>nologies. And no matter how clean and carbon free the United States becomes, <u><mark>if China and India are still burning massive volumes of oil we haven't done much to improve long-term security of any kind.</u> <u>The only way to achieve real energy security is to reengineer not just our energy economy but that of the entire world.</mark> Oil prices won't fall, evil regimes won't be bankrupt, and sustainability won't be possible—until global oil demand is slowed</u>. And outside of an economic meltdown, the only way it can be is if the tools we deploy to improve our own security can be somehow exported to other countries, and especially developing countries. Energy globalism doesn't mean that every new energy gadget or fuel we invent has to work in Beijing or Burkina Faso. It does, however, suggest that our current energy strategy, tailored primarily to our own markets and our own technical capabilities, will be next to useless in an energy economy that is increasingly global—and that at least some of our energy investments should be compatible with regions where natural resources are strained, governments are poor, and consumers don't have access to home-equity lines of credit</p>",,,Adv 1,431429,1,17138,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/JoDe/Emory-Jones-Demers-Neg-Miami-Round2.docx,565548,N,Miami,2,Mich DM,Bill Russell,,ndtceda14/Emory/JoDe/Emory-Jones-Demers-Neg-Miami-Round2.docx,,48469,JoDe,Emory JoDe,,An.....,Jo.....,Mi.....,De.....,18765,Emory,Emory,,,1004,ndtceda14,NDT/CEDA 2014-15,2014,cx,college,2

In this recent case of popular health  scare, as with many other instances of spreading epidemics over the past decade  (SARS, the H5N1 ‘‘bird flu,’’ but also AIDS before), individuals and groups are  asked to be the first layers of securitization by turning their bodies (or those of  family members, neighbors, coworkers, etc.) into primordial sites of analysis and  scrutiny from where not only the disease but, just as importantly, the fear about  what might happen with the disease will be monitored. With the ‘‘swine flu,’’ a  constant questioning of one’s body movements and symptomatic features, but  also of one’s daily habits, becomes an automatic (and autoimmune) measure  against the endemic fear. Individual and collective bodies become the most vital  dispositifs of containment of the pandemic and of the terror that inevitably will  spread. This management or governance of the ‘‘swine flu’’ and its scare (the  disease and its terror are inseparable from the moment a pandemic discourse is  launched) is said to require constant self-checking (Do I have a fever? Is my  cough a sign that I have been infected? Did I remember to wash my hands after  riding the bus or the subway?). But it also demands what can be called selfcarceralization  measures (we must stay home for several days if we feel sick; we  must wear protective masks if we venture outside and have a runny nose; we  must close entire schools for as long as necessary if we suspect that children  in the community have the flu). In the end, it is a full-blown biopolitics of selfterror  that sets in whereby people must allow themselves to be quarantined, must  accept being placed in hospital isolation, and must even be willing not to be  treated if pharmaceutical companies fail to produce enough vaccines for everyone.  As the A⁄H1N1 pandemic preemption regime reveals, individual and collective  bodies must always be prepared to immerse themselves into disciplinary and  regulatory procedures, into security mechanisms, and into governmental tactics.  In fact, they must act as dispositifs of fear governance themselves. This means that  bodies become the required lines of forces that connect the possible localized  symptoms to the global pandemic and its terror.  From this perspective on how bodies in societies of unease enable regimes  of biopolitical terror and are themselves the product of operations of governmentalized  fear, no return to a centralized model of power is necessary to  make sense of the terror embedded in contemporary regimes of government.  Rather, as the ‘‘swine flu’’ case shows, it is the horizontality, the capillarity,  and the propagation of carceral effects across space and through time that  authenticates this (self) imposition of governmental power and force.

I want to close by foregrounding the analytic power of conviviality that may further complicate how subjects are positioned, underscoring instead more fluid relations between capacity and debility. Conviviality, unlike notions of resistance, oppositionality, subversion or transgression (facets of queer exceptionalism that unwittingly dovetail with modern narratives of progress in modernity), foregrounds categories such as race, gender, and sexuality as events – as encounters – rather than as entities or attributes of the subject. Surrendering certain notions of revolution, identity politics, and social change – the ‘‘big utopian picture’’ that Massumi complicates in the opening epigraph of this essay – conviviality instead always entails an ‘‘experimental step.’’ Why the destabilization of the subject of identity and a turn to affect matters is because affect – as a bodily matter – makes identity politics both possible and yet impossible. In its conventional usage, conviviality means relating to, occupied with, or fond of feasting, drinking, and good company – to be merry, festive, together at a table, with companions and guests, and hence, to live with. As an attribute and function of assembling, however, conviviality does not lead to a politics of the universal or inclusive common, nor an ethics of individuatedness, rather the futurity enabled through the open materiality of bodies as a Place to Meet. We could usefully invoke Donna Haraway’s notion of ‘‘encounter value’’ here, a ‘‘becoming with’’ companionate (and I would also add, incompanionate) species, whereby actors are the products of relating, not pre-formed before the encounter (2008, 16). Conviviality is an ethical orientation that rewrites a Levinasian taking up of the ontology of the Other by arguing that there is no absolute self or other,15 rather bodies that come together and dissipate through intensifications and vulnerabilities, insistently rendering bare the instability of the divisions between capacity-endowed and debility-laden bodies. These encounters are rarely comfortable mergers but rather entail forms of eventness that could potentially unravel oneself but just as quickly be recuperated through a restabilized self, so that the political transformation is invited, as Arun Saldhana writes, through ‘‘letting yourself be destabilized by the radical alterity of the other, in seeing his or her difference not as a threat but as a resource to question your own position in the world’’ (2007, 118). Conviviality is thus open to its own dissolution and self-annihilation and less interested in a mandate to reproduce its terms of creation or sustenance, recognizing that political critique must be open to the possibility that it might disrupt and alter the conditions of its own emergence such that it is no longer needed – an openness to something other than what we might have hoped for. This is my alternative approach to Lee Edelman’s No Future, then, one that is not driven by rejecting the figure of the child as the overdetermined outcome of ‘‘reproductive futurism’’ (2004),16 but rather complicates the very terms of the regeneration of queer critique itself. Thus the challenge before us is how to craft convivial political praxis that does not demand a continual reinvestment in its form and content, its genesis or its outcome, the literalism of its object nor the direction of its drive.",4077.0,"<h4>We offer this debate as a queer convivial gather, a becoming with, imagining an unpredictable becoming with rather than an overdetermined effacement of queer alterity, its inability to move or escape, which characterizes the status quo</h4><p><strong>Puar 10.<u> Jasbir Puar, professor of women’s and gender studies at Rutgers University, Women & Performance: a journal of feminist theory, Vol. 19, No. 2, July 2009, pg. 168</p><p></u></strong>Out of the numerous possibilities that ‘‘assemblage theory’’ offers, much of it has already begun to transform queer theory, from Elizabeth Grosz’s crucial re-reading of the relations between bodies and prosthetics (which complicates not only the contours of bodies in relation to forms of bodily discharge, but also complicates the relationships to objects, such as cell phones, cars, wheelchairs, and the distinctions between them as capacity-enabling devices) (1994), to Donna Haraway’s cyborgs (1991), to Deleuze and Guattari’s ‘‘BwO’’ (Bodies without Organs – organs, loosely defined, rearranged against the presumed natural ordering of bodily capacity) (1987). <u>I want to close by foregrounding <strong><mark>the analytic power of conviviality</strong></mark> that <mark>may</mark> further <strong><mark>complicate</strong> how <strong>subjects are positioned</strong></mark>, <mark>underscoring</mark> instead <strong><mark>more fluid relations</strong></mark> between <strong>capacity</strong> and <strong>debility</u></strong>. <u><strong><mark>Conviviality</strong></mark>, <strong><mark>unlike</strong> notions of <strong>resistance</strong>, <strong>oppositionality</strong>, <strong>subversion</strong> or <strong>transgression</strong></mark> (facets of queer exceptionalism that unwittingly dovetail with modern narratives of progress in modernity), <strong><mark>foregrounds</strong> categories such as <strong>race</strong>, <strong>gender</strong>, and <strong>sexuality</strong> as <strong>events</strong></mark> – as <strong><mark>encounters</strong></mark> – <mark>rather than</mark> as <strong><mark>entities</strong> or <strong>attributes</strong></mark> of the <strong>subject</u></strong>. <u><strong><mark>Surrendering</strong> certain notions of <strong>revolution</strong>, <strong>identity politics</strong>, and <strong>social change</strong> – the ‘‘<strong>big utopian picture’’</u></strong></mark> that Massumi complicates in the opening epigraph of this essay – <u><strong><mark>conviviality</strong></mark> instead always <strong><mark>entails an ‘‘experimental step</u></strong></mark>.’’ <u>Why <mark>the <strong>destabilization</strong> of the <strong>subject of identity</strong> and a turn to <strong>affect</strong> matters is because <strong>affect</strong> – as a <strong>bodily matter</strong> – makes identity politics both <strong>possible</strong> and <strong>yet impossible</u></strong></mark>.

But they cannot be dismissed as impossible --- California has already reached 25% renewable electricity, India is producing the world's cheapest solar power, and other countries like Portugal and Denmark have demonstrated that renewable electricity is ready to carry more than half of their power load.California's oil target is breathtaking. It is what is needed - the latest report on the how much oil we can afford to burn and stay on a 2 degree pathway says that a third of existing global oil reserves must remain underground, including all of such unconventional sources as the deep oceans, the Arctic and tar sands. It is consistent with goals articulated by climate advocates and organizations.
But California - and the world -- are starting from almost scratch in seeking fuel diversity in the transportation sector- oil powers more than 90% of the world's transport. Both India and the US have enacted tough fuel efficiency standards to reduce petroleum waste. But California State's low-carbon fuel standard and ZEV mandates are only beginning to kick in, and transportation fuels have just been placed under the state's AB32 cap. (Oregon joined California a few days after Brown's speech putting in place requirements the fuels sold in the state have 10% less carbon by 2020.) Ramping up to a 50% reduction in petroleum use by 2030 will require a massive replacement of the state's existing vehicle fleets, engine technologies, transportation infrastructure and fuel networks.
But if California can realize this vision, the odds that the rest of the world moves beyond oil dependency go up staggeringly. Big oil gets this. Houston, Wichita, Calgary and Riyadh have no doubt seen dozens of meetings in the last week about how to crush Brown's vision before the public realizes just how practical it is.
""Mission Impossible"" will be the war-cry. ""They're going to take your car away"" the Koch Brother ads and sound bites will babble. ""Renewable power isn't reliable"" the coal companies will croak.
The reality is they are losing. Their campaign strategy - which worked for decades - was to mire the public debate down in climate science and risk, and thereby keep action on climate solutions at the ""too small to really matter"" scale. But they got greedy, and allowed the price of oil and coal to steadily soar. That opened up a market for clean energy that wasn't based on climate protection, although climate security is its most important benefit. No, Tesla and Solar City - and their Indian counterparts -- are powered by the fact that they offered better energy products with cheaper fuels.Renewable energy investment demonstrated this again in 2014. Even as coal, oil and natural gas prices fell, global investment in renewable energy jumped by 16%, and with steadily dropping costs for renewable energy, the volume of new clean energy increased by more than 25%.
Now that clean energy technologies have moved to a scale that anyone whose eyes are open can see that we don't necessarily need fossil fuels for much longer, leaders like Modi and Brown - and others around the world - can offer programs that both capture the popular imagination and confront the scale of the energy revolution we need.

Fostering care requires refusing to outsource harms to less valued persons and species. Debates about organs markets must take all factors into consideration, and not just a narrow calculus","With Richard Twine (2007; 2010), I argue here for a “less enclosed bioethics,” capable of considering not only the instrumental good for humans (or for some humans over others) in a particular decision-making context (medical, agricultural, pharmaceutical, or some combination thereof), but to take into account the interplay of society and environment, human and animal, global poor and global elite. As Twine writes, “[t]he narrowing of bioethics to medical ethics, or sometimes „biomedical‟ ethics, represents an unreflexive anthropocentric conception of the „bio‟ in bioethics, which brackets out environmental and animal ethics and tends to downplay socio-political, socio-economic and ecological inputs in human health” (2007). The “narrowing” of bioethics drives the agenda to subsume life on earth under the aegis of free-market capitalism: in a vicious oversimplification, anthropocentric bioethics provides its own justifications by ignoring the good of animals, the environment, and the less privileged humans who have disproportionately borne the risk in clinical trials (Cooper, 2011). 21
Hopefully bioethics will become, as the name implies, an ethics of all life, will become more utilitarian, in the classical sense of maximizing the good of all creatures. Perhaps Martha Nussbaum‟s concept of “flourishing” can help here (2001). Flourishing requires more than just averting death or extending life: it requires a passionate commitment to the others who co-constitute us as persons, who share in the networks of mutuality that make us human (Twine 2001). Compassionate engagement will not stop technological enframing, but it might change the way in which humans co-evolve with technology, with each other, and with other species. The human world is impoverished by the disappearances I have named above, and by opening the circle of concern, people choose a better future for themselves, other creatures, and the earth.
This call to bioethics to practice not just a crude calculus of benefits and rewards but an ethic of caring for all species—indeed all individuals—actually returns bioethics to its founding impulse as an evolutionary ethic of all species (Jonsen et al, 1993). Founding figures like Van Rensselaer Potter and Michael Fox envisioned an ethics that would connect environmental concerns with new medical technologies and human rights. They criticized the portioning of ethics into a variety of subfields that allowed for exploitation:
This disconnectedness [of objectifying other creatures] becomes generalized in sociopathic, biopathic, and zoopathic behaviors that collectively lead to the destruction of Earth. Collective biopathic behavior is exemplified by industrialism‟s destructiveness of the natural environment and by those values that place material gain over ecological sustainability, and that inevitably lead to economic instability and environmental disease (Fox, 1989, p. 41).22
Fox here summarizes what I have said in the above analysis of the organs trade: that the degradation of Earth, the lack of respect for human rights, and a disregard for non-human life are all related and ultimately trade short-term economic gain for long-term devastation. The only remedy for this “false reductionistic and mechanistic orientation” is a return to a “reverential attitude of heart and mind” (Fox, 1989, p. 41). Fostering this “reverential attitude” must become the primary task of bioethics, as it was at the field‟s founding. Markets may be able to accomplish amazing transfers of goods and information, but they don‟t innately have any caring properties. Fostering care requires all actors within the system to claim responsibility for all of the inputs into that system, refusing to outsource harms to less valued persons and species.

One argument for legalizing prostitution in the Netherlands was that legalization would help to end the exploitation of desperate immigrant women who had been trafficked there for prostitution. However, one report found that 80% of women in the brothels of the Netherlands were trafficked from other countries (Budapest Group, 1999)(1). In 1994, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) stated that in the Netherlands alone, “nearly 70 % of trafficked women were from CEEC [Central and Eastern European Countries]” (IOM, 1995, p. 4). The government of the Netherlands presents itself as a champion of anti-trafficking policies and programs, yet it has removed every legal impediment to pimping, procuring and brothels. In the year 2000, the Dutch Ministry of Justice argued in favor of a legal quota of foreign “sex workers,” because the Dutch prostitution market demanded a variety of “bodies” (Dutting, 2001, p. 16). Also in 2000, the Dutch government sought and received a judgment from the European Court recognizing prostitution as an economic activity, thereby enabling women from the European Union and former Soviet bloc countries to obtain working permits as “sex workers” in the Dutch sex industry if they could prove that they are self employed. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Europe report that traffickers use the work permits to bring foreign women into the Dutch prostitution industry, masking the fact that women have been trafficked, by coaching them to describe themselves as independent “migrant sex workers” (Personal Communication, Representative of the International Human Rights Network, 1999). In the year since lifting the ban on brothels in the Netherlands, eight Dutch victim support organizations reported an increase in the number of victims of trafficking, and twelve victim support organization reported that the number of victims from other countries has not diminished (Bureau NRM, 2002, p. 75). Forty-three of the 348 municipalities (12%) in the Netherlands choose to follow a no-brothel policy, but the Minister of Justice has indicated that the complete banning of prostitution within any municipality could conflict with the federally guaranteed “right to free choice of work” (Bureau NRM, 2002, p.19). The first steps toward legalization of prostitution in Germany occurred in the 1980s. By 1993, it was widely recognized that 75% of the women in Germany’s prostitution industry were foreigners from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and other countries in South America (Altink, 1993, p. 33). After the fall of the Berlin wall, 80% of the estimated 10,000 women trafficked into Germany were from Central and Eastern Europe and CIS countries (IOM. 1998a , p. 17). In 2002, prostitution in Germany was established as a legitimate job after years of being legalized in tolerance zones. Promotion of prostitution, pimping and brothels are now legal in Germany. The sheer volume of foreign women in the German prostitution industry suggests that these women were trafficked into Germany, a process euphemistically described as facilitated migration. It is almost impossible for poor women to facilitate their own migration, underwrite the costs of travel and travel documents, and set themselves up in “business” without intervention. In 1984, a Labor government in the Australian State of Victoria introduced legislation to legalize prostitution in brothels. Subsequent Australian governments expanded legalization culminating in the Prostitution Control Act of 1994. Noting the link between legalization of prostitution and trafficking in Australia, the US Department of State observed: “Trafficking in East Asian women for the sex trade is a growing problem…lax laws – including legalized prostitution in parts of the country – make [anti-trafficking] enforcement difficult at the working level” (U.S. Department of State, 2000, p. 6F).",3986.0,"<h4>Its one of the root causes - makes it harder to prosecute – increases trafficking</h4><p><strong>Raymond</strong>, professor at the University of Massachusetts, <strong>‘3</strong> [Janice, “Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution And a Legal Response to the Demand for Prostitution”, Journal of Trauma Practice, 2, 2003: pp. 315-332, RSR]</p><p><u><mark>Legalized</mark> or decriminalized <mark>prostitution</mark> industries <mark>are one of <strong>the root causes</strong> of sex trafficking</u></mark>.

One argument for legalizing prostitution in the Netherlands was that legalization would help to end the exploitation of desperate immigrant women who had been trafficked there for prostitution. However, one report found that 80% of women in the brothels of the Netherlands were trafficked from other countries (Budapest Group, 1999)(1). In 1994, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) stated that in the Netherlands alone, “nearly 70 % of trafficked women were from CEEC [Central and Eastern European Countries]” (IOM, 1995, p. 4). The government of the Netherlands presents itself as a champion of anti-trafficking policies and programs, yet it has removed every legal impediment to pimping, procuring and brothels. In the year 2000, the Dutch Ministry of Justice argued in favor of a legal quota of foreign “sex workers,” because the Dutch prostitution market demanded a variety of “bodies” (Dutting, 2001, p. 16). Also in 2000, the Dutch government sought and received a judgment from the European Court recognizing prostitution as an economic activity, thereby enabling women from the European Union and former Soviet bloc countries to obtain working permits as “sex workers” in the Dutch sex industry if they could prove that they are self employed. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Europe report that traffickers use the work permits to bring foreign women into the Dutch prostitution industry, masking the fact that women have been trafficked, by coaching them to describe themselves as independent “migrant sex workers” (Personal Communication, Representative of the International Human Rights Network, 1999). In the year since lifting the ban on brothels in the Netherlands, eight Dutch victim support organizations reported an increase in the number of victims of trafficking, and twelve victim support organization reported that the number of victims from other countries has not diminished (Bureau NRM, 2002, p. 75). Forty-three of the 348 municipalities (12%) in the Netherlands choose to follow a no-brothel policy, but the Minister of Justice has indicated that the complete banning of prostitution within any municipality could conflict with the federally guaranteed “right to free choice of work” (Bureau NRM, 2002, p.19). The first steps toward legalization of prostitution in Germany occurred in the 1980s. By 1993, it was widely recognized that 75% of the women in Germany’s prostitution industry were foreigners from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and other countries in South America (Altink, 1993, p. 33). After the fall of the Berlin wall, 80% of the estimated 10,000 women trafficked into Germany were from Central and Eastern Europe and CIS countries (IOM. 1998a , p. 17).

The sheer volume of foreign women in the German prostitution industry suggests that these women were trafficked into Germany, a process euphemistically described as facilitated migration. It is almost impossible for poor women to facilitate their own migration, underwrite the costs of travel and travel documents, and set themselves up in “business” without intervention. In 1984, a Labor government in the Australian State of Victoria introduced legislation to legalize prostitution in brothels.

Global transnational corporations rely on localities of many sorts as sites for capital accumulation through production, marketing, and knowledge-making. Global-localism has become both the paradigm of production and an explicit new strategy by which the corporation infiltrates various localities without forfeiting its global aims (Dirlik 34). From corporate headquarters, CEOs orchestrate the incorporation of particular localities into the demands of global capital at the same time that the corporation is domesticated into the local society. Thus it is in the interests of global capitalism to celebrate and enhance awareness of local communities, cultures, and forms of identification. But this cannot be done in a way that makes evident their exploitation, that is, in a way that makes visible the real material relationship between the global and the local (Dirlik 35). Against capitalism's penetration of local communities, many ""local"" groups— indigenous people's movements, ethnic and women's organizations, lesbian, gay, and transgender rights movements—have presented themselves as potential sites for liberation struggles. Undoubtedly, these struggles have indeed accomplished changes that have enhanced the quality of life for countless people. But the celebration of ""the local"" as a self-defined space for the affirmation of cultural identity and the formation of political resistance often also play into late capitalism's opportunistic use of localizing —not just as an arrangement of production but also as a structure of knowing. The turn to ""the local"" has also been the characteristic talisman of a postmodern culture and politics that has repudiated the totalizing narratives of modernity. The claims of indigenous and ethnic groups, of women, and of lesbian and gay people have been an important part of postmodern challenges to the adequacy of cultural narratives— among them enlightened humanism and Eurocentric scholarship— that do not address the histories of subaltern peoples. However, insofar as their counter-narratives put forward an alternative that de-links the interests of particular social groups from the larger collective that they are part of, they tend to promote political projects that keep the structures of capitalism invisible. While capitalism has always relied on global and local relations of production, it has also encouraged and required forms of consciousness that keep us from seeing the relationship between them. ""Local-izing"" in this sense becomes more than a spatial, territorial, or geographic term. Although it may be these too, localizing is also a way of seeing or knowing the world that imagines any social entity for example, a collectively shared identity or social practice—to be simply a temporary occurrence or a provisional point of departure for defining the goals of emancipation. One of the pitfalls in many of the strategies of various oppositional movements spawned in the wake of late capitalism has been that they have articulated their histories and political aims only in this local way. Such local responses to capitalism frequently have a powerful appeal, but they also have limited political scope. They authorize groups that have been disenfranchised, devalued, and excluded from the public spaces of a society to claim public legitimacy, to speak on their own behalf, and to act; they call attention to the oppression and in some cases to the extermination and erasure from historical memory of entire populations and cultures. And they promote a greater awareness of the ideological and political manipulation of social categories. All of these are important interventions.

An unspoken (and perhaps unidentified) effect of any drug legalization system is to transfer a significant portion of these social costs to the private sector employers in the form of larger and more frequent judgments rendered and fines imposed for the torts and crimes committed by employees under the influence of drugs, and of productivity costs of treatment and rehabilitation efforts required under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The unquantifiable costs associated with retraining new workers to replace those addicted to drugs, along with lost profitability associated with the possible inability to fire addicted and unproductive employees, should also be considered.
Our approach to the problem of drug abuse must be carefully thought out. It must be consistent with the political philosophy and principles upon which this country was founded-liberty, democracy, private ownership of property and a free market. Legalization of drugs is a libertarian position, but the current structure of our enterprise liability law has a distinctly socialist tone. We cannot use libertarian philosophy to justify gratifying our basest urges and socialist philosophy to justify asking others to pay for it. It is just this sort of philosophical schizophrenia that produces the inconsistent and utterly irreconcilable jurisprudence that we have seen recently in the area of respondeat superior.
There may be no imminent risk of drugs being legalized. But the mere prospect should bring into sharp focus the fact that our enterprise liability law has already strayed too far from its origins. The current legal climate seeks to make private employers insurers against any and all bad things that happen to people. This is contrary to the basic social and political philosophies of the United States. The problem needs to be redressed, even in the absence of legalized drugs.
Employers should not be the only ones concerned about drug legalization without tort reform. As has been shown in the past, corporations will not just blithely absorb these increased costs; they will be passed on to the American consumer. Before we decide to accept such costs, we must know what they are: personally invasive employment policies, dramatically reduced employment opportunities for those with a past criminal record or history of substance use or abuse, reduced productivity, expenses of defending protracted lawsuits, skyrocketing and unpredictable financial losses and inevitably inflated insurance costs, a greater number of goods and services whose costs will be beyond the means of an even greater segment of the population, bankruptcy of enterprises that will no longer be able to afford the losses and/or insurance associated with employee torts or crimes, and lost opportunities of innumerable ventures that will never come into existence for fear of overwhelming financial liability for unpredictable, uninsurable and uncontrollable employee behavior.

One argument for legalizing prostitution in the Netherlands was that legalization would help to end the exploitation of desperate immigrant women who had been trafficked there for prostitution. However, one report found that 80% of women in the brothels of the Netherlands were trafficked from other countries (Budapest Group, 1999)(1). In 1994, the International Organization of Migration (IOM) stated that in the Netherlands alone, “nearly 70 % of trafficked women were from CEEC [Central and Eastern European Countries]” (IOM, 1995, p. 4). The government of the Netherlands presents itself as a champion of anti-trafficking policies and programs, yet it has removed every legal impediment to pimping, procuring and brothels. In the year 2000, the Dutch Ministry of Justice argued in favor of a legal quota of foreign “sex workers,” because the Dutch prostitution market demanded a variety of “bodies” (Dutting, 2001, p. 16). Also in 2000, the Dutch government sought and received a judgment from the European Court recognizing prostitution as an economic activity, thereby enabling women from the European Union and former Soviet bloc countries to obtain working permits as “sex workers” in the Dutch sex industry if they could prove that they are self employed. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in Europe report that traffickers use the work permits to bring foreign women into the Dutch prostitution industry, masking the fact that women have been trafficked, by coaching them to describe themselves as independent “migrant sex workers” (Personal Communication, Representative of the International Human Rights Network, 1999). In the year since lifting the ban on brothels in the Netherlands, eight Dutch victim support organizations reported an increase in the number of victims of trafficking, and twelve victim support organization reported that the number of victims from other countries has not diminished (Bureau NRM, 2002, p. 75). Forty-three of the 348 municipalities (12%) in the Netherlands choose to follow a no-brothel policy, but the Minister of Justice has indicated that the complete banning of prostitution within any municipality could conflict with the federally guaranteed “right to free choice of work” (Bureau NRM, 2002, p.19). The first steps toward legalization of prostitution in Germany occurred in the 1980s. By 1993, it was widely recognized that 75% of the women in Germany’s prostitution industry were foreigners from Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay and other countries in South America (Altink, 1993, p. 33). After the fall of the Berlin wall, 80% of the estimated 10,000 women trafficked into Germany were from Central and Eastern Europe and CIS countries (IOM. 1998a , p. 17). In 2002, prostitution in Germany was established as a legitimate job after years of being legalized in tolerance zones. Promotion of prostitution, pimping and brothels are now legal in Germany. The sheer volume of foreign women in the German prostitution industry suggests that these women were trafficked into Germany, a process euphemistically described as facilitated migration. It is almost impossible for poor women to facilitate their own migration, underwrite the costs of travel and travel documents, and set themselves up in “business” without intervention. In 1984, a Labor government in the Australian State of Victoria introduced legislation to legalize prostitution in brothels. Subsequent Australian governments expanded legalization culminating in the Prostitution Control Act of 1994. Noting the link between legalization of prostitution and trafficking in Australia, the US Department of State observed: “Trafficking in East Asian women for the sex trade is a growing problem…lax laws – including legalized prostitution in parts of the country – make [anti-trafficking] enforcement difficult at the working level” (U.S. Department of State, 2000, p. 6F).",3986.0,"<h4>Its one of the root causes - makes it harder to prosecute – increases trafficking</h4><p><strong>Raymond</strong>, professor at the University of Massachusetts, <strong>‘3</strong> [Janice, “Ten Reasons for Not Legalizing Prostitution And a Legal Response to the Demand for Prostitution”, Journal of Trauma Practice, 2, 2003: pp. 315-332, RSR]</p><p><u><mark>Legalized</mark> or decriminalized <mark>prostitution</mark> industries <mark>are one of <strong>the root causes</strong> of sex trafficking</u></mark>.

Subsequent Australian governments expanded legalization culminating in the Prostitution Control Act of 1994. <u>Noting the link between legalization of prostitution and trafficking in Australia,</u> the US Department of State observed: “<u>Trafficking in East Asian women for the sex trade is a growing problem…lax laws – including <mark>legalized prostitution</mark> in parts of the country – <mark>make [anti-trafficking] enforcement difficult</mark> at the working level</u>” (U.S. Department of State, 2000, p. 6F). </p>",,Trafficking,1nc,431927,40,17154,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/KlLo/Emory-Klarman-Lowe-Neg-D6seceda-Round8.docx,565478,N,D6seceda,8,Wake Forest Manchester-Stirrat,"Galloway, Slattery, Watson","1nc politics employment PIC Swedenadv CP trafficking link turns

In June 2011, an Eritrean man entered an operating theater with a cancer-ridden windpipe, People had received windpipe transplants before, but this one was different. His was the first organ of its kind to be completely grown in a lab using the patient’s own cells. The windpipe is one of the latest successes in the ongoing quest to grow artificial organs in a lab. The goal is deceptively simple: build bespoke organs for individual patients by sculpting them from living flesh on demand. No-one will have to wait on lengthy transplant lists for donor organs and no-one will have to take powerful and debilitating drugs to prevent their immune systems from rejecting new body parts.

They are learning more about what they call scaffolds, compounds that act like mortar to hold cells in their proper place and that also play a major role in how cells are recruited for tissue repair. Tissue engineers caution that the work they are doing is experimental and costly, and that the creation of complex organs is still a long way off. But they are increasingly optimistic about the possibilities. Bioartificial Liver Boston company HepaLife is working on a “bioartificial” liver using a proprietary line of liver stem cells.

Bioartificial Hand Smarenergy coming from a handtHand is a bioadaptive hand that can actually feel. Its 40 sensors communicate back and forth directly with the brain using nerve endings in the arm.

scant reports of terrorists trying to enter the U.S. illegally are outnumbered by the numerous plots by citizens entering with valid passports","The Mexican government is expressing some irritation with Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who suggested last week that there’s a “very real possibility” that members of ISIS or other terrorist groups are entering the U.S. illegally via Mexico. As Perry acknowledged in his own remarks—and as the Pentagon confirmed—there’s “no clear evidence” that this is happening. But as is generally the case when fears of “El Qaida” periodically emerge, a lack of evidence is no barrier to bold sweeping claims.
Intelligence officials have warned for some time that there’s a possibility of terrorists entering the U.S. from Mexico, and there is indeed some evidence of groups like Hezbollah operating in South America. It would be foolish, then, to completely rule out the possibility that terrorists have crossed into the United States from down Mexico way. But the frequent claims that this is already a major problem are, well, ridiculous.
Last year, for instance, Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert declared on C-SPAN that ""We know al-Qaida has camps over with the drug cartels on the other side of the Mexican border” and that the group’s operatives are being trained to “act Hispanic.” This claim appears to have been based on essentially nothing.
Also last year, Deroy Murdock of National Review argued that “there are at least 7,518 reasons to get the U.S./Mexican border under control.” That figure refers to the number of citizens of State Department-listed “state sponsors of terrorism” arrested entering the U.S.—not just at the Mexican border—in fiscal 2011. More than half of those were from Cuba, a country which is still on the State Department’s list for a variety of reasons but whose immigrant population in the U.S. is not known as a hotbed of jihadist sentiment. (This isn’t to imply that those entering the U.S. from Syria or Afghanistan are likely terrorists. More likely, they’re fleeing terrorism.)
In 2012, Breitbart.com and a number of other conservative sites claimed that Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano had “admitted” that terrorists enter the U.S. from Mexico “from time to time.” The evidence for this supposed admission: what seems like a deliberate misreading of a garbled answer during congressional testimony. (Napolitano hasn’t always helped her own cause on this issue. In 2009 she had to walk back comments that seemed to suggest, falsely, that the 9/11 hijackers had entered the U.S. from Canada.)
The best-documented case of a connection between Middle Eastern terrorism and Mexican drug cartels was actually facilitated by the U.S. government. Mansour Arbabsiar, an Iranian-American car dealer in Texas, was arrested in 2011, and later convicted, after trying to recruit a Mexican drug cartel to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States. The Obama administration’s allegations that senior Iranian officials were likely in on the plot were met with some skepticism at the time. Whether or not that part of it’s true, we do know that no actual Mexican gangs were involved: Arbabsiar’s contact was an undercover DEA agent.
The DEA also set up a 2009 bust involving a deal between alleged members of al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and Colombia’s FARC to smuggle cocaine through West Africa to Europe. This was cited by the agency as evidence of the possibility of an “unholy alliance between South American narco-terrorists and Islamic extremists.” This despite the fact that there were never any actual South American narco-terrorists involved and DEA agents had set the whole thing up themselves. This case was also used in Congress to argue for tougher immigration rules—in this case, more scrutiny of travelers from Venezuela.
Again, it’s not outside the realm of possibility that someone planning an attack could sneak over the border. But the scant reports of terrorists trying to enter the U.S. illegally are far outnumbered by the numerous well-documented plots by native-born Americans, naturalized citizens, and foreigners entering the country with valid passports and visas.",4020.0,"<h4>No narco-terrorists from Mexico AND DEA solves<strong> now—plan not key</h4><p></strong>Joshua <strong>KEATING</strong>, staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs, <strong>8/25</strong> [“‘El Qaida’: The Persistent, Baseless Claim That Terrorists Will Swarm the U.S. From Mexico,” http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_world_/2014/08/25/rick_perry_says_isis_could_sneak_into_the_u_s_from_mexico_the_el_qaida_meme.html, NRB]</p><p><u>The Mexican government is expressing</u> some <u>irritation with</u> Texas Gov.

Underlying this anxiety was a scenario in which Iraq's sectarian and ethnic violence spills over into neighboring countries, producing conflicts between the major Arab states and Iran as well as Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government. These wars then destabilize the entire region well beyond the current conflict zone, involving heavyweights like Egypt. This is scary stuff indeed, but with the exception of the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds, the scenario is far from an accurate reflection of the way Middle Eastern leaders view the situation in Iraq and calculate their interests there. It is abundantly clear that major outside powers like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey are heavily involved in Iraq. These countries have so much at stake in the future of Iraq that it is natural they would seek to influence political developments in the country. Yet, the Saudis, Iranians, Jordanians, Syrians, and others are very unlikely to go to war either to protect their own sect or ethnic group or to prevent one country from gaining the upper hand in Iraq. The reasons are fairly straightforward. First, Middle Eastern leaders, like politicians everywhere, are primarily interested in one thing: self-preservation. Committing forces to Iraq is an inherently risky proposition, which, if the conflict went badly, could threaten domestic political stability. Moreover, most Arab armies are geared toward regime protection rather than projecting power and thus have little capability for sending troops to Iraq. Second, there is cause for concern about the so-called blowback scenario in which jihadis returning from Iraq destabilize their home countries, plunging the region into conflict. Middle Eastern leaders are preparing for this possibility. Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries. In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom. Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars.

The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, <u>this is the way many leaders view the current situation</u> in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, <u>the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight</u>. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a <u><mark>sectarian and ethnic struggle</u></mark> that outside powers may abet, but <u>will <mark>remain within</mark> the <mark>borders</mark> of Iraq</u>. <u>The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars.

Quebec is growing estranged from Canada","Quebec’s separatist party is expecting a comeback amidst student protest and economic uncertainty. As voters head to the polls to choose their government, the French-speaking province looks on course for another referendum to split from Canada.
Tuesday’s provincial election is a three-way fight between the incumbent Liberals, newly-formed coalition Avenir Quebec, and the separatist Party Quebecois (PQ).
PQ has been proving most popular at the polls – marching ahead of the others at around 33 per cent.
Liberal premier, Jean Charest, head of Quebec’s government for nearly a decade, called for an early election on August 1 due to looming student protests. However, throughout the election campaign he has trailed the separatist Party Quebecois leader Pauline Marois in the polls.
PQ’s popularity means the issue of Quebec’s separation from Canada has surfaced again. Quebec has already had two unsuccessful referenda that came close to splitting Quebec from Canada in the past: one in 1980 with 40 per cent support and another in 1995 with almost 50 per cent voting for separation.
The separatists leading in the polls claim their short-term priority would be picking the economy up off its knees, instead of pushing for a separation vote straight away.
""It's very important for me to manage our finances responsibly. That is without doubt why our engagements are the least costly of all parties,"" Marois told Canadian media, while outlining a program that sets out new spending of $1 billion over five years.
At the same time she stated that she would hold an independence vote ""tomorrow morning"" if the conditions were right. Further, the party leader clarified that a referendum on Quebec's independence would only be held if there was complete confidence in a win. For now, opinion polls suggest that only less than 40 per cent of the province's population would support a split.
Protests and lack of support for Liberals
The new buzz over Quebec comes after months of student and union protests raging this spring and summer against tuition hikes in the province and the controversial new Bill 78, which restricts mass gatherings in the province.
Tens of thousands of students have made their outrage public by demonstrating and clashing with police, making headlines across the world. Protests began in February, resulting in about 2,500 arrests. Tuesday's vote is seen by many as an echo of this public discontent.
Experts believe that the more the economic uncertainty continues, the louder the calls for Quebec's sovereignty will be.
After nine years of Liberals governing Quebec, people have grown wary and reluctant to re-elect them considering the student unrest that evolved into a larger social protest, says Concordia political science Professor Bruce Hicks.
""Quebecers tend to tire of the government and throw them out,"" he says. ""It's sort of been the tradition in Quebec politics.""
""It's not going to be a referendum or nothing,"" said Antonia Maioni, a political scientist at McGill University. ""The idea is to have smaller wins and move towards an eventual, perhaps, referendum. At least [Pauline Marois] can then go back to her party and say I'm moving to a third referendum.""
Referendum agenda:
PQ’s referendum agenda consists of two phases. First, Marois plans to ask Ottawa for greater control in areas such as foreign policy and economic development. Any kind of refusal from Ottawa would be met with a legislative fight and any of PQ’s losses would be added to the list of reasons why Quebec should separate.
The second phase is setting referendum in motion. PQ has already transferred the responsibility for calling a referendum to the general public. Currently, as soon as 850,000 people sign a petition – 15 per cent of Quebec’s population – the public could demand a referendum. Moreover, Marois plans to establish a new cabinet post that would manage such requests, CBC reported.
Canadian reporter Michael Forian says Quebec is growing estranged from the rest of Canada, while half of Canadians no longer care whether Quebec chooses to separate or not.",4087.0,"<h4>Causes Quebec to secede – the economy is a rallying point </h4><p><strong>RT News 12</strong> Quebexit: Canada's separation anxiety Published time: September 04, 2012 http://rt.com/news/quebec-election-separation-canada-309/</p><p><u><strong><mark>Quebec’s separatist party is expecting a comeback amidst</u></strong> </mark>student protest and <u><strong><mark>economic uncertainty</u></strong></mark>.

In Venezuela, Cuban pressure to a peaceful settlement may prove key","The dramatic improvement this week in U.S.-Cuban relations, and the possibility of an end to the decades-long U.S. embargo of the island, is set to transform political relations in the entire hemisphere. In the three posts below, the director of Crisis Group’s Latin America and Caribbean program, Javier Ciurlizza, and our vice president and special adviser on Latin America, Mark Schneider, look ahead to how the U.S. and Cuban moves could transform the wider region.
Ending the “Hemispheric Anomaly”
The announcements made by presidents Obama and Castro were enthusiastically welcomed across Latin America, from Mexico to Argentina, and in at least some quarters of Venezuela. Although there is a great deal to be done before any true normalisation of relations between the two countries, the announcements do at least represent the end of 60 years of Cuba as a “hemispheric anomaly”.
The U.S. embargo of Cuba, in place since 1961, was only the most explicit of several sanctions and decisions that effectively isolated Cuba from the rest of the continent. Expelled from the Organisation of American States (OAS) and excluded from summits, the Caribbean nation was caught up more than most in the maneuverings of the Cold War’s protagonists. Latin American countries aligned themselves with the United States during the 1960s and ’70s. In the 1980s they started to move toward a growing solidarity with their secluded neighbour.
In the past 20 years, a period marked by both a return to democracy and, in many Latin American countries, a marked shift to the left, the Cuba question was no longer taboo. It was continually pushed onto the regional political agenda even by nations ideologically distant from Havana. In fact, rejection of the embargo was one of the few things on which politicians, from the Rio Grande to Patagonia, could agree.
The embargo gradually came to isolate the U.S. as well as Cuba. The aggressive enforcement of Cuba sanctions on other Latin American countries trading with the island fanned resentment. It also distorted regional foreign relations. Some measured the friendship between nations according to the strength of their respective positions on the embargo. Others got caught up in an anti-imperialist discourse that undermined regional solidarity the more it insisted on it. The Cuba question sowed suspicion and raised temperatures when they needed lowering.
Normalisation of relations, then, is not just something for the U.S. and Cuba to carry out, it’s for the entire continent. Cuba will doubtless finally attend an Americas Summit – set for April in Panama – as suggested by President Obama, and its return to full membership in the Organisation of American States will be forcefully requested at the next OAS general assembly in Asunción, Paraguay, this coming June.
Cuba has worked for this normalisation, for example with its efforts, cited by Obama, to help combat Ebola. But I would say that two unacknowledged reasons were probably more important: what Cuba is doing for Colombia and what it can do for Venezuela.
The Colombia peace process, which is taking place thanks to the Castro brothers’ hospitality, would not have made the progress it has without close Cuban involvement, including in a recent and delicate hostage negotiation and in the strong (though implicit) message from Havana that the time really has come to end the last major armed conflict in the hemisphere. President Santos has not been shy about praising Cuba, whose continued participation in the process is the main external guarantor of a successful outcome.
In the case of Venezuela, Cuban pressure to reach a peaceful settlement to the political crisis may prove to be key. Cuba has now received the signal it needed from the U.S. that it will no longer be entirely dependent for its energy needs on Venezuela’s state-owned petroleum company and the chavista government’s Petro Caribe support program.",3929.0,"<h4>U.S.-Cuban normalization solves relations, OAS cohesion, and regional stability now </h4><p>Javier <strong>Ciurlizza 12-19</strong>, director of the International Crisis Group’s Latin America and Caribbean program, 12/19/14, “Cuba and the U.S.: Turning the Page,” http://blog.crisisgroup.org/latin-america/2014/12/19/cuba-and-the-u-s-a-new-chapter/</p><p><u>The dramatic improvement</u> this week <u>in <mark>U.S.-Cuban relations</u></mark>, and the possibility of an end to the decades-long U.S. embargo of the island, <u><mark>is set to transform political relations in the entire hemisphere</u></mark>.

When economies grow at a healthy clip, citizens are presumed to be too busy and too content to engage in protest or rebellion, and governments are thought to be flush with revenues they can use to enhance their own stability by producing public goods or rewarding cronies, depending on the type of regime they inhabit. When growth slows, however, citizens and cronies alike are presumed to grow frustrated with their governments, and the leaders at the receiving end of that frustration are thought to lack the financial resources to respond effectively. The expected result is an increase in the risks of social unrest, civil war, coup attempts, and regime breakdown.
Although it is pervasive, the assumption that countries’ economic growth rates strongly affect their political stability has not been subjected to a great deal of careful empirical analysis, and evidence from social science research to date does not unambiguously support it. Theoretical models of civil wars, coups d’etat, and transitions to and from democracy often specify slow economic growth as an important cause or catalyst of those events, but empirical studies on the effects of economic growth on these phenomena have produced mixed results. Meanwhile, the effects of economic growth on the occurrence or incidence of social unrest seem to have hardly been studied in recent years, as empirical analysis of contentious collective action has concentrated on political opportunity structures and dynamics of protest and repression.
This paper helps fill that gap by rigorously re-examining the effects of short-term variations in economic growth on the occurrence of several forms of political instability in countries worldwide over the past few decades. In this paper, we do not seek to develop and test new theories of political instability. Instead, we aim to subject a hypothesis common to many prior theories of political instability to more careful empirical scrutiny. The goal is to provide a detailed empirical characterization of the relationship between economic growth and political instability in a broad sense. In effect, we describe the conventional wisdom as seen in the data. We do so with statistical models that use smoothing splines and multiple lags to allow for nonlinear and dynamic effects from economic growth on political stability. We also do so with an instrumented measure of growth that explicitly accounts for endogeneity in the relationship between political instability and economic growth. To our knowledge, ours is the first statistical study of this relationship to simultaneously address the possibility of nonlinearity and problems of endogeneity. As such, we believe this paper offers what is probably the most rigorous general evaluation of this argument to date.
As the results show, some of our findings are surprising. Consistent with conventional assumptions, we find that social unrest and civil violence are more likely to occur and democratic regimes are more susceptible to coup attempts around periods of slow economic growth. At the same time, our analysis shows no significant relationship between variation in growth and the risk of civil-war onset, and results from our analysis of regime changes contradict the widely accepted claim that economic crises cause transitions from autocracy to democracy. While we would hardly pretend to have the last word on any of these relationships, our findings do suggest that the relationship between economic growth and political stability is neither as uniform nor as strong as the conventional wisdom(s) presume(s). We think these findings also help explain why the global recession of 2008–2010 has failed thus far to produce the wave of coups and regime failures that some observers had anticipated, in spite of the expected and apparent uptick in social unrest associated with the crisis.",4069.0,"<h4>There is no causal relationship between the economy and conflict—the best study proves.</h4><p><strong>Brandt and Ulfelder 11</strong>—*Patrick T.

fast track is neither necessary nor sufficient to get agreements","The Wall Street Journal’s Mary O’Grady put out an excellent column yesterday expressing skepticism about the trade agenda in 2014.  I agree with almost everything in the piece, with one major exception.  Contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom, the lack of “fast track” trade promotion authority has not been and will not be an obstacle to completing the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.
Her concern about the lack of fast track relates to the willingness of other countries to negotiate when the president has not secured trade promotion authority:
Mr. Obama’s trade team has been working on [the TPP] for years. But U.S. negotiators still don’t have “trade promotion authority” (TPA) from Congress. This means there really hasn’t been much negotiating at all because the U.S. team still doesn’t know how much flexibility it has from Congress to cut final deals on sensitive areas of trade. That will come with TPA, which sets “objectives” that the administration must meet. No U.S. trading partner is going to talk seriously unless the president has it.
I strongly disagree with this characterization. For the last three years, countries have been knocking down the door trying to get into the TPP negotiations. They have done this even while knowing that the TPP will inevitably be a vehicle for pushing U.S. economic and strategic priorities at their expense. These governments see the economic benefit of access to the U.S. market and have shown no reluctance to engage in negotiations despite the Obama administration’s apparent disinterest in securing fast track authority from Congress.
If you believe the administration’s claim that the TPP negotiations are in their closing stages, then the impact of fast track could be especially counterproductive. It is true that a bill from Congress laying out its sensitivities will better inform and ensure foreign negotiators, but it will also reduce the flexibility of U.S. negotiators to make the concessions needed to get the deal completed.
The real danger that fast track helps alleviate is not completion of the negotiations, but passage of the agreement through Congress. In the past, it made sense to impose Congress’s negotiating objectives through a fast track bill because Congress was unlikely to ratify an agreement that didn’t meet their demands.
But today, trade agreements are passed through Congress on largely partisan lines regardless of what’s in them. As O’Grady notes, House Democrats are not even involved in crafting the fast track bill because nothing in the bill will convince them to support the TPP when it finally comes up for a vote.
We shouldn’t forget that those same House Democrats, when they were in charge in 2007, ignored the previous fast track arrangement, demanded major changes to already completed agreements, and refused ever to hold a vote on agreements with Colombia, Korea, and Panama. As O’Grady explains:
Mrs. Pelosi didn’t want the Colombia FTA to go to the floor for a vote because it had enough support to pass. So even though the law instructed her to send it, she refused and stuck it in a drawer. That amounted to double-crossing the best ally the U.S. has in Latin America.
So if trade promotion authority convinces U.S. trading partners that Congress won’t obstruct or meddle with the agreement, they haven’t been paying attention. Senate Democrats are much friendlier toward trade and Republicans hold a majority in the House. It’s hard to imagine this Congress refusing to hold a vote on the TPP even without trade promotion authority.
Unfortunately, while fast track is neither necessary nor sufficient to get agreements through Congress, it is certain to reduce the value of the TPP as a vehicle to liberalize trade.  Any fast track bill coming out of Congress this year is bound to contain demands to include harmful rules in the TPP related to labor and environmental protection.

Fostering care requires refusing to outsource harms to less valued persons and species. Debates about organs markets must take all factors into consideration, and not just a narrow calculus","With Richard Twine (2007; 2010), I argue here for a “less enclosed bioethics,” capable of considering not only the instrumental good for humans (or for some humans over others) in a particular decision-making context (medical, agricultural, pharmaceutical, or some combination thereof), but to take into account the interplay of society and environment, human and animal, global poor and global elite. As Twine writes, “[t]he narrowing of bioethics to medical ethics, or sometimes „biomedical‟ ethics, represents an unreflexive anthropocentric conception of the „bio‟ in bioethics, which brackets out environmental and animal ethics and tends to downplay socio-political, socio-economic and ecological inputs in human health” (2007). The “narrowing” of bioethics drives the agenda to subsume life on earth under the aegis of free-market capitalism: in a vicious oversimplification, anthropocentric bioethics provides its own justifications by ignoring the good of animals, the environment, and the less privileged humans who have disproportionately borne the risk in clinical trials (Cooper, 2011). 21
Hopefully bioethics will become, as the name implies, an ethics of all life, will become more utilitarian, in the classical sense of maximizing the good of all creatures. Perhaps Martha Nussbaum‟s concept of “flourishing” can help here (2001). Flourishing requires more than just averting death or extending life: it requires a passionate commitment to the others who co-constitute us as persons, who share in the networks of mutuality that make us human (Twine 2001). Compassionate engagement will not stop technological enframing, but it might change the way in which humans co-evolve with technology, with each other, and with other species. The human world is impoverished by the disappearances I have named above, and by opening the circle of concern, people choose a better future for themselves, other creatures, and the earth.
This call to bioethics to practice not just a crude calculus of benefits and rewards but an ethic of caring for all species—indeed all individuals—actually returns bioethics to its founding impulse as an evolutionary ethic of all species (Jonsen et al, 1993). Founding figures like Van Rensselaer Potter and Michael Fox envisioned an ethics that would connect environmental concerns with new medical technologies and human rights. They criticized the portioning of ethics into a variety of subfields that allowed for exploitation:
This disconnectedness [of objectifying other creatures] becomes generalized in sociopathic, biopathic, and zoopathic behaviors that collectively lead to the destruction of Earth. Collective biopathic behavior is exemplified by industrialism‟s destructiveness of the natural environment and by those values that place material gain over ecological sustainability, and that inevitably lead to economic instability and environmental disease (Fox, 1989, p. 41).22
Fox here summarizes what I have said in the above analysis of the organs trade: that the degradation of Earth, the lack of respect for human rights, and a disregard for non-human life are all related and ultimately trade short-term economic gain for long-term devastation. The only remedy for this “false reductionistic and mechanistic orientation” is a return to a “reverential attitude of heart and mind” (Fox, 1989, p. 41). Fostering this “reverential attitude” must become the primary task of bioethics, as it was at the field‟s founding. Markets may be able to accomplish amazing transfers of goods and information, but they don‟t innately have any caring properties. Fostering care requires all actors within the system to claim responsibility for all of the inputs into that system, refusing to outsource harms to less valued persons and species.

In an attempt to unpack the role of demand, researchers for the International Organisation for Migration questioned whether or not demand exists for a 'trafficked' person, as opposed to an 'exploitable' person. They suggest that: It is hard to imagine an abusive plantation manager or sweatshop owner turning down the opportunity to subject a worker to forced labour or slavery-like practices because s/he is a 'smuggled person' rather than a 'victim of trafficking', and harder still to imagine a client refusing to buy the sexual services of a prostitute for similar reasons. (IOM 2003, 9) The same study also questioned whether or not there is a strong demand for exploitable people, particularly in the sex industry. They found that among 'clients' there is a 'reluctance to buy sex from prostitutes who work in the most visibly exploitative conditions'. However, this reluctance is sometimes reduced when clients are intoxicated or short of money (!OM 2003, 26). The study shows that there is a greater demand for sex workers who clients perceive as being 'free' and voluntarily choosing to work in the sex industry, while migrant sex workers are 'viewed by some clients as a ""poor man's substitute"" for more desirable and ""classier"" local sex workers' (IOM 2003, 23). This challenges the assumption made by some abolitionists that demand for women who are 'more compliant and will accept higher levels of violence' (Project Respect, APJC Submission 200J) is responsible for fuelling the trade in trafficking victims in the sex industry. It also suggests that it is possible to differentiate between a general demand for commercial sex, versus a demand for cheap services. While abolitionists construct borderlines of moral harm which condemn all demand for commercial sex as a pull factor for trafficking, this research suggests that the real harm can be more accurately located in the desire for cheap goods and services, regardless of the industry in which they are found. The report from the IOM also argues that it is likely that the availability of sex workers generates demand, rather than demand originating with clients (10M 2003, 41). Criminalisation of sex work as a strategy to redt]ce demand for sexual services. has also been challenged. Della Giusta's study of the complex factors surrounding demand for sexual services found that a client's fear of a damaged reputation due to the public stigma surrounding prostitution had a direct impact on their willingness to pay for sex. While this suggests that prohibitionist or abolitionist policies should decrease demand for prostitution, Della Giusta also found that criminalisation had not reduced demand (Della Giusta 2008, 127). In fact, the sex industry is experiencing unparalleled growth in the first decade of the twenty-first century (Sanders 2006; Agustin 2003; Bernstein 2007). This includes the increasing acceptability of strip clubs and lap dancing bars as well as sexual commercialisation via the internet and mobile phones. A review by Di Nicola and Ruspini (2009) of studies focused on clients of sex workers led them to the conclusion that there is very little evidence of abolitionism, non-regulationism or prohibitionism eradicating demand for sexual services. This is especially the case since zero tolerance policies directed toward street prostitution now means that the vast majority of sexual commerce occurs indoors the creation if you like of new moral communities. In line with this is some evidence of a shift in social and sexual relationships, structures and attitudes (Hayes et al. 2012). And with this comes a great potential to capitalise on some clients' willingness to differentiate between free and forced prostitution. According to Di Nicola and Ruspini (2009, 233) 'the chance of getting free and non-exploited commercial sex could represent a strong tool against trafficking'.",3963.0,"<h4>Abolitionism fails to reduce demand.

While this suggests that prohibitionist or abolitionist policies should decrease demand for prostitution, <u>Della <mark>Giusta</mark> also <mark>found</mark> that <mark>criminalisation had not reduced demand</u></mark> (Della Giusta 2008, 127). In fact, <u>the sex industry is experiencing unparalleled growth in the first decade of the twenty-first century</u> (Sanders 2006; Agustin 2003; Bernstein 2007). This includes the increasing acceptability of strip clubs and lap dancing bars as well as sexual commercialisation via the internet and mobile phones. A <u><mark>review by</mark> Di Nicola and <mark>Ruspini</u></mark> (2009) <u><mark>of studies focused on clients</u></mark> of sex workers <u><mark>led them to the conclusion</mark> that <mark>there is</mark> very <mark>little evidence of abolitionism</mark>, non-regulationism or prohibitionism <mark>eradicating demand</mark> for sexual services</u>. <u>This is especially the case since <mark>zero tolerance policies directed toward street prostitution</mark> now <mark>means</mark> that <mark>the</mark> vast <mark>majority of sexual commerce occurs indoors</u></mark> the creation if you like of new moral communities. In line with this is some evidence of a shift in social and sexual relationships, structures and attitudes (Hayes et al. 2012). And with this comes a great potential to capitalise on some clients' willingness to differentiate between free and forced prostitution.

Quebec is growing estranged from Canada","Quebec’s separatist party is expecting a comeback amidst student protest and economic uncertainty. As voters head to the polls to choose their government, the French-speaking province looks on course for another referendum to split from Canada.
Tuesday’s provincial election is a three-way fight between the incumbent Liberals, newly-formed coalition Avenir Quebec, and the separatist Party Quebecois (PQ).
PQ has been proving most popular at the polls – marching ahead of the others at around 33 per cent.
Liberal premier, Jean Charest, head of Quebec’s government for nearly a decade, called for an early election on August 1 due to looming student protests. However, throughout the election campaign he has trailed the separatist Party Quebecois leader Pauline Marois in the polls.
PQ’s popularity means the issue of Quebec’s separation from Canada has surfaced again. Quebec has already had two unsuccessful referenda that came close to splitting Quebec from Canada in the past: one in 1980 with 40 per cent support and another in 1995 with almost 50 per cent voting for separation.
The separatists leading in the polls claim their short-term priority would be picking the economy up off its knees, instead of pushing for a separation vote straight away.
""It's very important for me to manage our finances responsibly. That is without doubt why our engagements are the least costly of all parties,"" Marois told Canadian media, while outlining a program that sets out new spending of $1 billion over five years.
At the same time she stated that she would hold an independence vote ""tomorrow morning"" if the conditions were right. Further, the party leader clarified that a referendum on Quebec's independence would only be held if there was complete confidence in a win. For now, opinion polls suggest that only less than 40 per cent of the province's population would support a split.
Protests and lack of support for Liberals
The new buzz over Quebec comes after months of student and union protests raging this spring and summer against tuition hikes in the province and the controversial new Bill 78, which restricts mass gatherings in the province.
Tens of thousands of students have made their outrage public by demonstrating and clashing with police, making headlines across the world. Protests began in February, resulting in about 2,500 arrests. Tuesday's vote is seen by many as an echo of this public discontent.
Experts believe that the more the economic uncertainty continues, the louder the calls for Quebec's sovereignty will be.
After nine years of Liberals governing Quebec, people have grown wary and reluctant to re-elect them considering the student unrest that evolved into a larger social protest, says Concordia political science Professor Bruce Hicks.
""Quebecers tend to tire of the government and throw them out,"" he says. ""It's sort of been the tradition in Quebec politics.""
""It's not going to be a referendum or nothing,"" said Antonia Maioni, a political scientist at McGill University. ""The idea is to have smaller wins and move towards an eventual, perhaps, referendum. At least [Pauline Marois] can then go back to her party and say I'm moving to a third referendum.""
Referendum agenda:
PQ’s referendum agenda consists of two phases. First, Marois plans to ask Ottawa for greater control in areas such as foreign policy and economic development. Any kind of refusal from Ottawa would be met with a legislative fight and any of PQ’s losses would be added to the list of reasons why Quebec should separate.
The second phase is setting referendum in motion. PQ has already transferred the responsibility for calling a referendum to the general public. Currently, as soon as 850,000 people sign a petition – 15 per cent of Quebec’s population – the public could demand a referendum. Moreover, Marois plans to establish a new cabinet post that would manage such requests, CBC reported.
Canadian reporter Michael Forian says Quebec is growing estranged from the rest of Canada, while half of Canadians no longer care whether Quebec chooses to separate or not.",4087.0,"<h4>Causes Quebec to secede – the economy is a rallying point </h4><p><strong>RT News 12</strong> Quebexit: Canada's separation anxiety Published time: September 04, 2012 http://rt.com/news/quebec-election-separation-canada-309/</p><p><u><strong><mark>Quebec’s separatist party is expecting a comeback amidst</u></strong> </mark>student protest and <u><strong><mark>economic uncertainty</u></strong></mark>.

Underlying this anxiety was a scenario in which Iraq's sectarian and ethnic violence spills over into neighboring countries, producing conflicts between the major Arab states and Iran as well as Turkey and the Kurdistan Regional Government. These wars then destabilize the entire region well beyond the current conflict zone, involving heavyweights like Egypt. This is scary stuff indeed, but with the exception of the conflict between Turkey and the Kurds, the scenario is far from an accurate reflection of the way Middle Eastern leaders view the situation in Iraq and calculate their interests there. It is abundantly clear that major outside powers like Saudi Arabia, Iran and Turkey are heavily involved in Iraq. These countries have so much at stake in the future of Iraq that it is natural they would seek to influence political developments in the country. Yet, the Saudis, Iranians, Jordanians, Syrians, and others are very unlikely to go to war either to protect their own sect or ethnic group or to prevent one country from gaining the upper hand in Iraq. The reasons are fairly straightforward. First, Middle Eastern leaders, like politicians everywhere, are primarily interested in one thing: self-preservation. Committing forces to Iraq is an inherently risky proposition, which, if the conflict went badly, could threaten domestic political stability. Moreover, most Arab armies are geared toward regime protection rather than projecting power and thus have little capability for sending troops to Iraq. Second, there is cause for concern about the so-called blowback scenario in which jihadis returning from Iraq destabilize their home countries, plunging the region into conflict. Middle Eastern leaders are preparing for this possibility. Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries. In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom. Finally, there is no precedent for Arab leaders to commit forces to conflicts in which they are not directly involved. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, this is the way many leaders view the current situation in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a sectarian and ethnic struggle that outside powers may abet, but will remain within the borders of Iraq. The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars. But given its experience with ambiguous conflicts, the region has also developed an intuitive ability to contain its civil strife and prevent local conflicts from enveloping the entire Middle East.",3950.0,"<h4>Middle East war doesn’t escalate</h4><p><strong>Maloney 7</strong> (Suzanne, Senior Fellow – Saban Center for Middle East Policy, Steve Cook, Fellow – Council on Foreign Relations, and Ray Takeyh, Fellow – Council for Foreign Relations, “Why the Iraq War Won’t Engulf the Mideast”, International Herald Tribune, 6-28, http://www.brookings.edu/views/op-ed/maloney20070629.htm)</p><p>Long before the Bush administration began selling ""the surge"" in Iraq as a way to avert a general war <u>in the Middle East</u>, <u><mark>observers</mark> both inside and outside the government <mark>were</mark> growing <mark>concerned about</mark> the potential for <mark>armed conflict</mark> <mark>among</mark> the <mark>regional powers</u></mark>.

Unlike in the 1990s, when Arab fighters in the Afghan jihad against the Soviet Union returned to Algeria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia and became a source of instability, Arab security services are being vigilant about who is coming in and going from their countries. In the last month, the Saudi government has arrested approximately 200 people suspected of ties with militants. Riyadh is also building a 700 kilometer wall along part of its frontier with Iraq in order to keep militants out of the kingdom. Finally, <u><mark>there is no precedent</mark> for Arab leaders <mark>to commit forces</mark> to conflicts <mark>in which they are not</mark> directly <mark>involved</u></mark>. The Iraqis and the Saudis did send small contingents to fight the Israelis in 1948 and 1967, but they were either ineffective or never made it. In the 1970s and 1980s, Arab countries other than Syria, which had a compelling interest in establishing its hegemony over Lebanon, never committed forces either to protect the Lebanese from the Israelis or from other Lebanese. The civil war in Lebanon was regarded as someone else's fight. Indeed, <u>this is the way many leaders view the current situation</u> in Iraq. To Cairo, Amman and Riyadh, <u>the situation in Iraq is worrisome, but in the end it is an Iraqi and American fight</u>. As far as Iranian mullahs are concerned, they have long preferred to press their interests through proxies as opposed to direct engagement. At a time when Tehran has access and influence over powerful Shiite militias, a massive cross-border incursion is both unlikely and unnecessary. So Iraqis will remain locked in a <u><mark>sectarian and ethnic struggle</u></mark> that outside powers may abet, but <u>will <mark>remain within</mark> the <mark>borders</mark> of Iraq</u>. <u>The Middle East is a region both prone and accustomed to civil wars.

fast track is neither necessary nor sufficient to get agreements","The Wall Street Journal’s Mary O’Grady put out an excellent column yesterday expressing skepticism about the trade agenda in 2014.  I agree with almost everything in the piece, with one major exception.  Contrary to the prevailing conventional wisdom, the lack of “fast track” trade promotion authority has not been and will not be an obstacle to completing the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations.
Her concern about the lack of fast track relates to the willingness of other countries to negotiate when the president has not secured trade promotion authority:
Mr. Obama’s trade team has been working on [the TPP] for years. But U.S. negotiators still don’t have “trade promotion authority” (TPA) from Congress. This means there really hasn’t been much negotiating at all because the U.S. team still doesn’t know how much flexibility it has from Congress to cut final deals on sensitive areas of trade. That will come with TPA, which sets “objectives” that the administration must meet. No U.S. trading partner is going to talk seriously unless the president has it.
I strongly disagree with this characterization. For the last three years, countries have been knocking down the door trying to get into the TPP negotiations. They have done this even while knowing that the TPP will inevitably be a vehicle for pushing U.S. economic and strategic priorities at their expense. These governments see the economic benefit of access to the U.S. market and have shown no reluctance to engage in negotiations despite the Obama administration’s apparent disinterest in securing fast track authority from Congress.
If you believe the administration’s claim that the TPP negotiations are in their closing stages, then the impact of fast track could be especially counterproductive. It is true that a bill from Congress laying out its sensitivities will better inform and ensure foreign negotiators, but it will also reduce the flexibility of U.S. negotiators to make the concessions needed to get the deal completed.
The real danger that fast track helps alleviate is not completion of the negotiations, but passage of the agreement through Congress. In the past, it made sense to impose Congress’s negotiating objectives through a fast track bill because Congress was unlikely to ratify an agreement that didn’t meet their demands.
But today, trade agreements are passed through Congress on largely partisan lines regardless of what’s in them. As O’Grady notes, House Democrats are not even involved in crafting the fast track bill because nothing in the bill will convince them to support the TPP when it finally comes up for a vote.
We shouldn’t forget that those same House Democrats, when they were in charge in 2007, ignored the previous fast track arrangement, demanded major changes to already completed agreements, and refused ever to hold a vote on agreements with Colombia, Korea, and Panama. As O’Grady explains:
Mrs. Pelosi didn’t want the Colombia FTA to go to the floor for a vote because it had enough support to pass. So even though the law instructed her to send it, she refused and stuck it in a drawer. That amounted to double-crossing the best ally the U.S. has in Latin America.
So if trade promotion authority convinces U.S. trading partners that Congress won’t obstruct or meddle with the agreement, they haven’t been paying attention. Senate Democrats are much friendlier toward trade and Republicans hold a majority in the House. It’s hard to imagine this Congress refusing to hold a vote on the TPP even without trade promotion authority.
Unfortunately, while fast track is neither necessary nor sufficient to get agreements through Congress, it is certain to reduce the value of the TPP as a vehicle to liberalize trade.  Any fast track bill coming out of Congress this year is bound to contain demands to include harmful rules in the TPP related to labor and environmental protection.

When economies grow at a healthy clip, citizens are presumed to be too busy and too content to engage in protest or rebellion, and governments are thought to be flush with revenues they can use to enhance their own stability by producing public goods or rewarding cronies, depending on the type of regime they inhabit. When growth slows, however, citizens and cronies alike are presumed to grow frustrated with their governments, and the leaders at the receiving end of that frustration are thought to lack the financial resources to respond effectively. The expected result is an increase in the risks of social unrest, civil war, coup attempts, and regime breakdown.
Although it is pervasive, the assumption that countries’ economic growth rates strongly affect their political stability has not been subjected to a great deal of careful empirical analysis, and evidence from social science research to date does not unambiguously support it. Theoretical models of civil wars, coups d’etat, and transitions to and from democracy often specify slow economic growth as an important cause or catalyst of those events, but empirical studies on the effects of economic growth on these phenomena have produced mixed results. Meanwhile, the effects of economic growth on the occurrence or incidence of social unrest seem to have hardly been studied in recent years, as empirical analysis of contentious collective action has concentrated on political opportunity structures and dynamics of protest and repression.
This paper helps fill that gap by rigorously re-examining the effects of short-term variations in economic growth on the occurrence of several forms of political instability in countries worldwide over the past few decades. In this paper, we do not seek to develop and test new theories of political instability. Instead, we aim to subject a hypothesis common to many prior theories of political instability to more careful empirical scrutiny. The goal is to provide a detailed empirical characterization of the relationship between economic growth and political instability in a broad sense. In effect, we describe the conventional wisdom as seen in the data. We do so with statistical models that use smoothing splines and multiple lags to allow for nonlinear and dynamic effects from economic growth on political stability. We also do so with an instrumented measure of growth that explicitly accounts for endogeneity in the relationship between political instability and economic growth. To our knowledge, ours is the first statistical study of this relationship to simultaneously address the possibility of nonlinearity and problems of endogeneity. As such, we believe this paper offers what is probably the most rigorous general evaluation of this argument to date.
As the results show, some of our findings are surprising. Consistent with conventional assumptions, we find that social unrest and civil violence are more likely to occur and democratic regimes are more susceptible to coup attempts around periods of slow economic growth. At the same time, our analysis shows no significant relationship between variation in growth and the risk of civil-war onset, and results from our analysis of regime changes contradict the widely accepted claim that economic crises cause transitions from autocracy to democracy. While we would hardly pretend to have the last word on any of these relationships, our findings do suggest that the relationship between economic growth and political stability is neither as uniform nor as strong as the conventional wisdom(s) presume(s). We think these findings also help explain why the global recession of 2008–2010 has failed thus far to produce the wave of coups and regime failures that some observers had anticipated, in spite of the expected and apparent uptick in social unrest associated with the crisis.",4069.0,"<h4>There is no causal relationship between the economy and conflict—the best study proves.</h4><p><strong>Brandt and Ulfelder 11</strong>—*Patrick T.

When some government action can prove successful in the short-term the cartels will adapt When crackdowns occur in particular industries, the cartel will shift away from it cartels are becoming diversified networks of businesses, not simply reliant on the traditional drug trade for revenue. No matter how low prices for some particular drug fall, the cartels will likely just shift to new activities. Thus, Mexican farmers’ move to opium production was all too predictable. Put simply, legalizing cannabis in the U.S. will hurt the cartels, but it is unlikely that it will kill the cartels by any means.","Farmers in Sinaloa are no longer planting the crop the farmers are planting opium which will supply heroin recent reports of cartels moving into new activities Zetas was involved in illegal coal mining the Knights Templar involvement in the avocado trade cartels will adapt When crackdowns occur in particular industries, the cartel shift cartels are diversified not simply reliant on drug revenue legalizing cannabis is unlikely it will kill cartels","Everyone agrees that drug cartels are terrible, violent organizations, which is probably why a recent Washington Post article describing a collapse in Mexican wholesale marijuana prices after 2012 has garnered so much attention. Advocates of cannabis legalization in the U.S. were quick to jump on the story as a victory over the cartels since Mexico decriminalized the drug in 2009. These advocates have long claimed that legalization would lead to a weakening of Mexico’s cartels and, with it, their stranglehold on the country. Unfortunately, this may be wishful thinking, as there are doubts about how much cannabis legalization can really hurt the cartels. “Farmers in the storied ‘Golden Triangle’ region of Mexico’s Sinaloa state … say they are no longer planting the crop,” the heavily quoted Washington Post article reports about marijuana farming. “Its wholesale price has collapsed in the past five years, from $100 per kilogram to less than $25.” While a reader can easily misconstrue this quote as saying that less pot is being produced, thereby weakening the cartels, the article then goes on to describe how the farmers are instead planting opium poppies, which will supply the US heroin trade instead. Indeed, recent months have seen a surge in reports of cartels moving into new forms of illegal activities. A few weeks ago, Mexican authorities in seized 68,000 tons of cartel-mined iron ore while en route to China. Last year, the Zetas cartel was revealed to have been involved in massive illegal coal mining operations. Around the same time, the Knights Templar cartel’s vast involvement in the avocado trade was exposed. And then came the revelation that the “lime crisis” every margarita-lover in the nation is freaking out about is, at least in part, being fueled by cartel involvement in the fruit’s trade. Cartels’ movement into normally legal markets seems shocking to many, but the ideas are far from new. As far back as 1995, noted social scientists Diego Gambetta and Peter Reuter wrote about how cartels will seek out opportunity for profit any way they can, citing Cosa Nostra’s involvement in price fixing the concrete industry. Cartels act as catalysts of illicit entrepreneurship, giving individuals the ability to enter the darker side of legal markets. The lime trade is an excellent example. Exporting limes to the U.S. is a good, common, and legal trade. The Knights Templar thereby expropriated some lime farms while using their clout to regulate competition out of existence. Cartels have proven extremely adaptable to outside pressure. When some government action can prove successful in the short-term, like the Coast Guard shutting down the Caribbean cocaine trade, the cartels will adapt. In the Caribbean case, it meant shifting supply routes overland via Mexico. When crackdowns occur in particular industries, the cartel will shift away from it. A notable example of this was the U.S.-based mafia’s avoidance of the heroin trade in the 1950s, ceding the trade to the Sicilian mob. The penalties for trafficking heroin were so stiff that they posed systemic risk to the mafia, and thus they avoided an otherwise lucrative market. As such, cartels are becoming diversified networks of businesses, not simply reliant on the traditional drug trade for revenue. Back in 2011, Sylvia Longmire noted that this diversification would insulate cartels from economic and political shocks of legalization, just like having a diverse portfolio of stocks insulates investors from some risk. No matter how low prices for some particular drug fall, the cartels will likely just shift to new activities. Thus, Mexican farmers’ move to opium production was all too predictable. At the same time, any time a cartel is forced to exit a trade, especially one with previously-high margins, it generally come out weaker than before. Put simply, legalizing cannabis in the U.S. will hurt the cartels, but it is unlikely that it will kill the cartels by any means.",3986.0,"<h4>Cartels are adaptable – they’ll survive</h4><p><strong>Zaiac 5/21/</strong>14 (Nick, public policy researcher for PanAm Post, Marijuana Legalization Won’t Crowd Out<u> Cartels, http://dailycaller.com/2014/05/21/marijuana-legalization-wont-crowd-out-cartels/)</p><p></u>Everyone agrees that drug cartels are terrible, violent organizations, which is probably why a recent Washington Post article describing a collapse in Mexican wholesale marijuana prices after 2012 has garnered so much attention. <u>Advocates of cannabis legalization in the U.S. were quick to jump on the story as a victory over the cartels since Mexico decriminalized the drug in 2009.

Last year, <u>the <mark>Zetas</mark> cartel <mark>was</mark> revealed to have been <mark>involved in</mark> massive <mark>illegal coal mining</mark> operations.</u> Around the same time, <u><mark>the Knights Templar</mark> cartel’s vast <mark>involvement in the avocado trade</mark> was exposed</u>. And then came the revelation that <u>the “lime crisis” every margarita-lover in the nation is freaking out about is, at least in part, being fueled by cartel involvement in the fruit’s trade. </u>Cartels’ movement into normally legal markets seems shocking to many, but the ideas are far from new. As far back as 1995, noted social scientists Diego Gambetta and Peter Reuter wrote about how cartels will seek out opportunity for profit any way they can, citing Cosa Nostra’s involvement in price fixing the concrete industry. Cartels act as catalysts of illicit entrepreneurship, giving individuals the ability to enter the darker side of legal markets. The lime trade is an excellent example. Exporting limes to the U.S. is a good, common, and legal trade. <u>The Knights Templar</u> thereby <u>expropriated some lime farms while using their clout to regulate competition out of existence. Cartels have proven extremely adaptable to outside pressure. When some government action can prove successful in the short-term</u>, like the Coast Guard shutting down the Caribbean cocaine trade, <u>the <mark>cartels will adapt</u></mark>. In the Caribbean case, it meant shifting supply routes overland via Mexico. <u><mark>When crackdowns occur in particular industries, the cartel</mark> will <mark>shift</mark> away from it</u>. A notable example of this was the U.S.-based mafia’s avoidance of the heroin trade in the 1950s, ceding the trade to the Sicilian mob. The penalties for trafficking heroin were so stiff that they posed systemic risk to the mafia, and thus they avoided an otherwise lucrative market. As such, <u><mark>cartels are</mark> becoming <mark>diversified</mark> networks of businesses, <mark>not simply reliant on</mark> the traditional <mark>drug</mark> trade for <mark>revenue</mark>.</u> Back in 2011, Sylvia Longmire noted that this diversification would insulate cartels from economic and political shocks of legalization, just like having a diverse portfolio of stocks insulates investors from some risk. <u>No matter how low prices for some particular drug fall, the cartels will likely just shift to new activities. Thus, Mexican farmers’ move to opium production was all too predictable.</u> At the same time, any time a cartel is forced to exit a trade, especially one with previously-high margins, it generally come out weaker than before. <u>Put simply, <mark>legalizing cannabis</mark> in the U.S. will hurt the cartels, but it <mark>is unlikely</mark> that <mark>it will kill</mark> the <mark>cartels</mark> by any means.</p></u>",,,1nc Cartels,56569,33,17172,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/KlLo/Emory-Klarman-Lowe-Neg-Hurricanedebates2015-Quarters.docx,565466,N,Hurricanedebates2015,Quarters,Michigan State Caporal-Zemel,"Campbell, Kallmyer, Paul","1nc - T CSA politics healthcare counterplan security critique waivers (amnesty)
