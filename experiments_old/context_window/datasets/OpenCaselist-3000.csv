The possibility of abrupt climate change is linked to what may be the most problematic possibility of all—""positive"" feedback effects where the initial warming has effects that generate more warming. Several of these feedbacks are possible. First, the land's ability to store carbon could weaken. Soils and forests can dry out or burn and release carbon; less plant growth can occur, thus reducing nature's ability to remove carbon from the air. Second, carbon sinks in the oceans could also be reduced due to ocean warming and other factors. Third, the potent greenhouse gas methane could be released from peat bogs, wetlands, and thawing permafrost, and even from the methane hydrates in the oceans, as the planet warms and changes. Finally, the earth's albedo, the reflectivity of the earth's surface, is slated to be reduced as large areas now covered by ice and snow diminish or are covered by meltwater. All these effects would tend to make warming self-reinforcing, possibly leading to a greatly amplified greenhouse effect. The real possibility of these amplifying feedbacks has alarmed some of our top scientists. James Hansen, the courageous NASA climate scientist, is becoming increasingly outspoken as his investigations lead him to more and more disturbing conclusions. He offered the following assessment in 2007: ""Our home planet is now dangerously near a 'tipping point.' Human-made greenhouse gases are near a level such that important climate changes may proceed mostly under the climate system's own momentum. Impacts would include extermination of a large fraction of species on the planet, shifting of climatic zones due to an intensified hydrologic cycle with effects on freshwater availability and human health, and repeated worldwide coastal tragedies associated with storms and a continuously rising sea level. .. .

The apocalyptic frame, has been developed over a time in which the US has refused all action on greenhouse gas reductions.","Along with supporting diverse sites of human agency, rhetors may want to avoid the inherent conservatism of apocalyptic discourse. Apocalyptic rhetoric suggests that received sense-making systems (i.e., common sense) cannot explain great changes, but that various prophets can (Brummett, 1991). In the case of climate change, apocalyptic framing endows an array of experts and elites (including scientists, actuaries, politicians, and journalists) with the power to understand, frame, and perhaps resolve the issue; helping fuel the common sentiment that ordinary people cannot do anything to reduce global warming (Lorenzoni et al., 2007), or that they will not need to because ""'someone will invent the gizmo' that solves the problem"" (Gregg Easterbrook, quoted in Nocera, 2007, p. C1). Perhaps by linking climate change solutions to common sense-especially Americans' notions of sacrifice, conservation, community, and family (Moser & Dilling, 2004)-we may free scientists from their role as controversial prophets, while expanding agency beyond Fate. As our analysis suggests, simply creating awareness of an issue is not enough to create an active public. Rather, that awareness needs to work toward arousing the public toward action (Hallahan, 2001). In conclusion, an apocalyptic structure permeates the global warming narrative in the American elite and popular press, with the potential to force the predicted tragedy into being, due to its limitations on human agency. We echo the call for communication scholars of all methodological commitments to join environmental advocates, climate scientists, and others, in their efforts to build a collective will to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (Moser & Dilling, 2007). A great part of this effort is in reframing the way the press constitutes climate change discourse (Boykoff, 2007b). These efforts also must extend beyond the media to include other arenas in which an active public is aroused, from kitchen tables and water coolers, to board rooms and classrooms. By providing the public, agenda-setting professionals (e.g., public relations practitioners and journalists), and community leaders with ways to structure communication that promote agency, rhetoricians might advance widespread public action on climate change. The apocalyptic frame, particularly in its tragic version, is not an effective rhetorical strategy for this situation. It has been developed over at least the last decade of press coverage, a time in which the US has refused all but the most paltry political action on greenhouse gas reductions. Tragic apocalyptic discourse encourages belief in prophesy at the expense of practicing persuasion, even as it provokes resignation in the face of a human-induced dilemma. Given the tragic apocalyptic frame's ineffectiveness at inspiring action-or, at least its persistent evacuation of agency-we must promote more action-oriented rhetorical strategies. Together, we may advance the climate change narrative from an apocalyptic tragedy to a more comic telos for humanity.",3051.0,"<h4>Framing the global environment in a securitizing manner causes elite takeover and diminishes agency, exacerbating the problem</h4><p><strong>Foust and Murphy 2009</strong> </p><p>Christina R.

Today, <u><strong>four changes</u></strong> in the region have <u><strong>made a hemispheric partnership both possible and necessary</u></strong>. <u><strong>First, the <mark>key challenges</mark> faced</u></strong> by the United States and the hemisphere’s other countries— <u><strong><mark>such as securing sustainable energy supplies</u></strong></mark>, <u><strong><mark>combating and adapting to climate change</mark>, </u></strong>and combating organized crime and drug trafficking—<u><strong>have become so complex and deeply transnational that they <mark>cannot be managed or overcome by any single country.</u></strong></mark> <u><strong><mark>Washington needs partners in the LAC region</u></strong></mark> with a shared sense of responsibility and a common stake in the future. For example, drug trafficking and its associated criminal networks have now spread so widely across the hemisphere that they can no longer be regarded as a “U.S. problem,” a “Colombian problem,” or a “Mexican problem.” The threat posed by these networks can only be countered through coordinated efforts across producing, consuming, and transshipment countries, all of which have a shared interest in controlling the flow of arms, money, vehicles, and drugs. <u><strong><mark>The process of combating and adapting to climate change </mark>also <mark>exemplifies the need for a hemispheric partnership.</mark> All carbon-emitting societies contribute </u></strong>to the problem to different degrees, <u><strong>and all will experience its consequences. <mark>The solutions</u></strong></mark>—<u><strong>ranging <mark>from</mark> developing <mark>alternative fuels to</mark> adapting to <mark>ecological shocks</mark>—all <mark>require</mark> sustained <mark>cooperation among the hemisphere’s countries.</p></u></strong></mark>",1AC UNLV,Advantage -- OAS,,276052,28,16969,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/BaSh/Baylor-Barron-Sheaff-Aff-Wake-Round1.docx,564679,A,Wake,1,George Washington TT,DStout,"1AC - MJ - UN and OAS

They contaminate water supplies, result in deforestation, and threaten indigenous species. But I had no idea how widespread the destruction really was--just recently, the ""Save our Sierras"" campaign uncovered 69 marijuana plantations run by Mexican drug cartels and seized over a billion dollars worth of plants in California national forests. According to a report in Greenwire, ""Mexican drug trafficking organizations have been operating on public lands to cultivate marijuana, with serious consequences for the environment and public safety,"" said Gil Kerlikowske, chief of the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy. In creating, and eventually abandoning, vast marijuana plantations the cartels are leaving heaps of trash, slaughtered animals, copious amounts of pesticides, and dangerous spilled fuels in their wake. Essentially, each plantation results in an environmental disaster. But the campaign to stop them is vigorous, and is already seeing encouraging results: The massive operation that began in February has already seized about 318,000 marijuana plants worth an estimated $1.1 billion, officials announced last week. In addition to 82 arrests, the multi-jurisdictional federal, state and local operation netted 42 pounds of processed marijuana, more than $40,000 in cash, 25 weapons and three vehicles.

Instead, US forests are suffering. The pesticides are perhaps the worst byproduct of the operations: Growers in Fresno County used a cocktail of pesticides and fertilizers many times stronger than what is used on residential lawns to cultivate their crop . . . While the chemical pesticides kill insects and other organisms directly, fertilizer runoff contaminates local waterways and aids in the growth of algae and weeds. The vegetation in turn impedes water flows that are critical to frogs, toads and salamanders in the Kings and San Joaquin rivers. As a response to the issue, California is hiring more forest service law enforcement, and expanding their efforts. But it seems to me that the surest way to prevent such destruction in the forests is to legalize the growing of marijuana, and thus removing the incentives to operate recklessly and clandestinely--and allowing for regulation of pesticide and fertilizer use.

Deforestation accounts globally for about 12% of total man-made greenhouse gas emissions¶ (GHG). Deforestation causes roughly the same GHG emissions as both transport (13%) and ¶ agriculture (12%). ¶ • Forests are crucially important in soaking up humankind’s GHG emissions. Unfortunately,¶ deforestation largely cancels out this effect. While forests have taken up about 45% of the ¶ CO2 emissions to the atmosphere since 1750, this is roughly balanced by emissions from ¶ deforestation.¶ • Climate change is an additional stressor for forest ecosystems. Increased tree mortality has ¶ occurred in some regions, notably western and boreal North America – either as a result of ¶ high temperatures, drought, and/or changes in the distribution and abundance of insect pests ¶ and diseases which have been attributed, at least in part, to warming. In addition, the fire¶ regime in the boreal forests has intensified in recent decades.¶ What do the findings mean in practice?¶ • For forests, mitigation and adaptation go together. In order for humans to adapt to climate ¶ change, we need forests because they provide essential “services”, such as water, food and ¶ raw materials. Maintaining forests as intact, i.e. as unbroken tracts of forest landscape,¶ increases their resilience to climate change. This also enables the species living within them, ¶ to adapt to climate change and maintain these services.¶ • For the Amazon, a combination of deforestation and climate change could to lead to a ¶ “tipping point”, where the forest cover could change rapidly into savannah. This would cause ¶ not only a loss in biodiversity, but release carbon to the atmosphere, leading to additional ¶ climate change. However, climate change alone will not cause this tipping point to be ¶ reached this century, especially if warming remains below 2°C. Reductions in deforestation ¶ rates will also navigate us away from such a tipping point. The massive decline in ¶ deforestation rates for the Brazilian Amazon between the years 2005-2012 demonstrateshat policy-led approaches to curb deforestation can work (see IPCC WG2 Ch. 4). However, the reverse is also ¶ true as witnessed by last year’s increases in deforestation in the Amazon as a result of a severely weakened ¶ domestic forest policy.¶ What Greenpeace says about climate change and forests¶ Deforestation together with climate change makes for a vicious cocktail. Climate change is expected to increase ¶ periods of drought in tropical forests. At the same time, deforestation fragments the remaining forest, making it ¶ more vulnerable to drought-induced fires.

While individual states remain the laboratories of innovation, it is time for the federal government to make sure that states, businesses, and individuals are able to act in an environment that has coherent and consistent laws. Congress should pursue each of the following options: 1. Tax and Regulate Marijuana Considering the growing number of jurisdictions that legalize medical marijuana and the two jurisdictions that legalize recreational use, it is time that Congress end the federal prohibition on marijuana, removing it from the Controlled Substances Act and creating a regulatory and taxation framework, similar to the frameworks in place for alcohol and tobacco. A specific tax on marijuana grown for all purposes should be imposed to help fund substance abuse dependency treatment, law enforcement, and help reduce the federal debt.

However, whether as an approach to learning, innovation, persuasion or culture shift, policy simulations derive their power from two central features: their combination of simulation and gaming (Geurts et al. 2007). 1. The simulation element: the unique combination of simulation with role-playing. The unique simulation/role-play mix enables participants to create possible futures relevant to the topic being studied. This is diametrically opposed to the more traditional, teacher-centric approaches in which a future is produced for them. In policy simulations, possible futures are much more than an object of tabletop discussion and verbal speculation. ‘No other technique allows a group of participants to engage in collective action in a safe environment to create and analyse the futures they want to explore’ (Geurts et al. 2007: 536). 2. The game element: the interactive and tailor-made modelling and design of the policy game. The actual run of the policy simulation is only one step, though a most important and visible one, in a collective process of investigation, communication, and evaluation of performance. In the context of a post-graduate course in public policy development, for example, a policy simulation is a dedicated game constructed in collaboration with practitioners to achieve a high level of proficiency in relevant aspects of the policy development process. To drill down to a level of finer detail, policy development simulations—as forms of interactive or participatory modelling— are particularly effective in developing participant knowledge and skills in the five key areas of the policy development process (and success criteria), namely: Complexity, Communication, Creativity, Consensus, and Commitment to action (‘the five Cs’).

Victoria, Australia is a state similar to Nevada in that international tourists flock toward its gaming industry. n149 Australian popular culture has promoted its reputation as a ""nation [*985] of gamblers."" n150 Victoria in particular has been the heartland for gambling within the racing industry since the 1800s, n151 but the state began to increase its profits in the casino industry in 1991. n152 The Victorian casino industry tends to attract young tourists between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four, usually students. n153¶ Almost two decades ago, Victoria enacted the Prostitution Control Act of 1994 to reform and legalize adult prostitution. n154 Parts of the casino and prostitution industry combined efforts, with one brothel requesting customers book appointments with casino chips. n155 Among other goals, the Prostitution Control Act of 1994 was meant to protect prostitutes from violence and health risks and to eliminate criminals from providing prostitution services. n156 However, the opposite occurred. n157¶ To meet the demand for cheap sex and limitless sexual services, 400 illegal brothels sprung up throughout the state by 2003, n158 as compared with 95 legal brothels. n159 This number does not include other unlicensed escort agencies n160 and the surge in street prostitution. n161 Additionally, within a few years after legalization, Victoria became the state with the highest number of children used in commercial sex, including children less than ten years of age. n162 Although Australia legalized prostitution to keep children out of the sex trade, both legal and illegal brothels engaged in the sex trafficking of minors. n163¶ For women working in legal brothels, the rising demand for sex in Victoria increased the competition among prostitutes. n164 This resulted in brothels placing increased pressure on women to book a sex buyer even if the buyer was violent, drunk, or demanding. n165 The blurred line between what constituted [*986] work and what constituted sexual assault made it exceedingly difficult for women to know when to seek help from the police. n166 The normalization of prostitution resulted in a lack of support services rather than a push for exit programs, such that ""those involved in a cycle of drugs, prostitution, conviction and vulnerability were likely to be trapped within the industry."" n167¶ Other promised benefits of legalization did not materialize. Tax evasion continued to occur among both legal and illegal brothels. n168 Women working in legal brothels were unwilling to submit tax returns because they did not want an official register of their work in prostitution. n169 Also, many women in the legal sex industry remained vulnerable to labor abuse because the industry often employed young workers from diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. n170 These women often worked long hours and were poorly paid, yet because of their backgrounds they remained unaware of their employment rights. n171",3026.0,"<h4><strong>Legalization expands the black market, increases violence from customers, makes it exceedingly difficult to get police help, and decreases support services and exit programs</h4><p>Forrey ‘14</p><p></strong>[Chariane K.

Victoria, Australia is a state similar to Nevada in that international tourists flock toward its gaming industry. n149 Australian popular culture has promoted its reputation as a ""nation [*985] of gamblers."" n150 Victoria in particular has been the heartland for gambling within the racing industry since the 1800s, n151 but the state began to increase its profits in the casino industry in 1991. n152 The Victorian casino industry tends to attract young tourists between the ages of eighteen and twenty-four, usually students. n153¶ Almost two decades ago, <u><strong><mark>Victoria enacted the </mark>Prostitution Control Act of 1994 to reform and legalize adult prostitution.</u></strong> n154 Parts of the casino and prostitution industry combined efforts, with one brothel requesting customers book appointments with casino chips. n155 Among other goals, <u><strong><mark>the</u></strong> </mark>Prostitution Control <u><strong><mark>Act</u></strong> </mark>of 1994 <u><strong>was meant <mark>to protect prostitutes from violence </mark>and health risks and to eliminate criminals from providing prostitution services</u></strong>. n156 However, <u><strong><mark>the opposite occurred</u></strong></mark>. n157¶ <u><strong><mark>To meet the demand</u></strong> </mark>for cheap sex and limitless sexual services, <u><strong><mark>400 illegal brothels sprung up</u></strong> </mark>throughout the state by 2003, n158 <u><strong>as <mark>compared with 95 legal brothels</u></strong></mark>. n159 <u><strong>This</u></strong> number <u><strong>does not include other unlicensed escort agencies</u></strong> n160 <u><strong>and</u></strong> <u><strong>the surge in street prostitution</u></strong>. n161 Additionally, within a few years after legalization, Victoria became the state with the highest number of children used in commercial sex, including children less than ten years of age. n162 Although Australia legalized prostitution to keep children out of the sex trade, both legal and illegal brothels engaged in the sex trafficking of minors. n163¶ <u><strong>For women working in legal brothels, the rising demand</u></strong> for sex in Victoria <u><strong>increased <mark>the competition among prostitutes</u></strong></mark>. n164 <u><strong>This <mark>resulted in </u></strong></mark>brothels placing <u><strong><mark>increased pressure </mark>on women <mark>to book a</mark> sex <mark>buyer even if the buyer was violent, drunk, or demanding</u></strong></mark>. n165 <u><strong><mark>The blurred line between </mark>what constituted [*986] <mark>work and </mark>what constituted <mark>sexual assault made it exceedingly difficult for women to </mark>know when to <mark>seek help from the police</mark>.</u></strong> n166 <u><strong>The <mark>normalization of prostitution resulted in a lack of support services rather than a push for exit programs,</mark> <mark>such that ""those involved </mark>in a cycle of drugs, prostitution, conviction and vulnerability <mark>were likely to be trapped </mark>within the industry</u></strong>."" n167¶ Other promised benefits of legalization did not materialize. Tax evasion continued to occur among both legal and illegal brothels. n168 Women working in legal brothels were unwilling to submit tax returns because they did not want an official register of their work in prostitution. n169 Also, <u><strong>many <mark>women </mark>in the legal sex industry <mark>remained vulnerable to </mark>labor <mark>abuse because the industry</mark> often <mark>employed </mark>young <mark>workers from diverse </mark>cultural and linguistic <mark>backgrounds</u></strong></mark>. n170 <u><strong>These women often worked long hours and were poorly paid, yet because of their backgrounds they remained unaware of their employment rights</u></strong>. n171</p>",1NR,Case,Ext – 1NC #2,429849,1,16976,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/BaSh/Baylor-Barron-Sheaff-Neg-UMKC-Round6.docx,564680,N,UMKC,6,UCO SW,Brian Box,"1AC Prostitution  Feminist Standpoint

The Asia-Pacific region can be regarded as a zone of both relative insecurity and strategic stability. It contains some of the world’s most significant flashpoints – the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the Siachen Glacier – where tensions between nations could escalate to the point of major war. It is replete with unresolved border issues; is a breeding ground for transnationa terrorism and the site of many terrorist activities (the Bali bombings, the Manila superferry bombing); and contains overlapping claims for maritime territories (the Spratly Islands, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands) with considerable actual or potential wealth in resources such as oil, gas and fisheries. Finally, the Asia-Pacific is an area of strategic significance with many key sea lines of communication and important chokepoints. Yet despite all these potential crucibles of conflict, the Asia-Pacific, if not an area of serenity and calm, is certainly more stable than one might expect. To be sure, there are separatist movements and internal struggles, particularly with insurgencies, as in Thailand, the Philippines and Tibet. Since the resolution of the East Timor crisis, however, the region has been relatively free of open armed warfare. Separatism remains a challenge, but the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance, but its impact is contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearisation of the peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict any time soon, especially given recent Kuomintang Party victories in Taiwan and efforts by Taiwan and China to re-open informal channels of consultation as well as institutional relationships between organisations responsible for cross-strait relations. And while in Asia there is no strong supranational political entity like the European Union, there are many multilateral organisations and international initiatives dedicated to enhancing peace and stability, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. In Southeast Asia, countries are united in a common geopolitical and economic organisation – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – which is dedicated to peaceful economic, social and cultural development, and to the promotion of regional peace and stability.

The risk of a large increase in damaging forms of consumption would be greater at a lower price; the need for enforcement against illicit production and sale, or tax evasion by licensed producers and sellers, would be higher. Another central decision is whether to allow private for-profit enterprises to produce and sell cannabis, or instead to restrict licit activity to: (1) Production for personal use and free distribution only. (2) Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises such as consumer-owned cooperatives like the Spanish ‘cannabis clubs’ (3) Some variety of state monopoly, perhaps of retail sales only, leaving production to private enterprise. If the private enterprise model is chosen, an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration to ensure the existence of a variety of competing firms (thus perhaps limiting the marketing and political power of the industry as a whole and – again perhaps – increasing the rate of product innovation and the range of products easily available) or instead to allow the likely development of oligopolistic competition, as in the markets for cigarettes and beer.

Earth's temperature is likely to jump six degrees between now and the end of the century even if every country cuts greenhouse gas emissions as proposed, according to a United Nations update. Scientists looked at emission plans from 192 nations and calculated what would happen to global warming. The projections take into account 80 percent emission cuts from the U.S. and Europe by 2050, which are not sure things. The U.S. figure is based on a bill that passed the House of Representatives but is running into resistance in the Senate, where debate has been delayed by health care reform efforts. Carbon dioxide, mostly from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and oil, is the main cause of global warming, trapping the sun's energy in the atmosphere. The world's average temperature has already risen 1.4 degrees since the 19th century. Much of projected rise in temperature is because of developing nations, which aren't talking much about cutting their emissions, scientists said at a United Nations press conference Thursday. China alone adds nearly 2 degrees to the projections. ""We are headed toward very serious changes in our planet,"" said Achim Steiner, head of the U.N.'s environment program, which issued the update on Thursday. The review looked at some 400 peer-reviewed papers on climate over the last three years.  Even if the developed world cuts its emissions by 80 percent and the developing world cuts theirs in half by 2050, as some experts propose, the world is still facing a 3-degree increase by the end of the century, said Robert Corell, a prominent U.S. climate scientist who helped oversee the update.  Corell said the most likely agreement out of the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen in December still translates into a nearly 5-degree increase in world temperature by the end of the century. European leaders and the Obama White House have set a goal to limit warming to just a couple degrees.  The U.N.'s environment program unveiled the update on peer-reviewed climate change science to tell diplomats how hot the planet is getting. The last big report from the Nobel Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change came out more than two years ago and is based on science that is at least three to four years old, Steiner said.  Global warming is speeding up, especially in the Arctic, and that means that some top-level science projections from 2007 are already out of date and overly optimistic. Corell, who headed an assessment of warming in the Arctic, said global warming ""is accelerating in ways that we are not anticipating.""  Because Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are melting far faster than thought, it looks like the seas will rise twice as fast as projected just three years ago, Corell said.

Our final contrasting set of expectations relates to the degree to which the public will support or demand retribution against terrorists and supporting states. Here our data show that support for using conventional United States military force to retaliate against terrorists initially averaged above midscale, but did not reach a high level of demand for military action. Initial support declined significantly across all demographic and belief categories by the time of our survey in 2002. Furthermore, panelists both in 2001 and 2002 preferred that high levels of certainty about culpability (above 8.5 on a scale from zero to ten) be established before taking military action. Again, we find the weight of evidence supporting revisionist expectations of public opinion. Overall, these results are inconsistent with the contention that highly charged events will result in volatile and unstructured responses among mass publics that prove problematic for policy processes. The initial response to the terrorist strikes demonstrated a broad and consistent shift in public assessments toward a greater perceived threat from terrorism, and greater willingness to support policies to reduce that threat. But even in the highly charged context of such a serious attack on the American homeland, the overall public response was quite measured. On average, the public showed very little propensity to undermine speech protections, and initial willingness to engage in military retaliation moderated significantly over the following year. Perhaps most interesting is that the greatest propensity to change beliefs between 2001 and 2002 was evident among the best-educated and wealthiest of our respondents— hardly the expected source of volatility, but in this case they may have represented the leading edge of belief constraints reasserting their influence in the first year following 9/11. This post-9/11 change also reflected an increasing delineation of policy preferences by ideological and partisan positions. Put differently, those whose beliefs changed the most in the year between surveys also were those with the greatest access to and facility with information (the richest, best educated), and the nature of the changes was entirely consistent with a structured and coherent pattern of public beliefs.

Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized","One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed. “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains. This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy. Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it. There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.” Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks. On the other hand, the hemp-food industry is “pretty well settled,” says Murphy. If hemp growing were legalized in the U.S., he adds, a lot of Canadian processors would probably open facilities here. Legalization would also help hemp food break out of its niche-market status. If it received “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the Food and Drug Administration, major brands would be less reluctant to use it. Until then, he says, Coca-Cola won’t put hemp milk in Odwalla Future Shakes, and we’re not likely to see hempseed Clif Bars. Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry, says Murphy. Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized in 1998. The nation’s production leaped to 35,000 acres in 1999 and plummeted to about 4,000 in 2001, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada’s main hemp-producing province.

It is more appropriately considered to have become a form of governance or technique of administration through relationships of violence that reduce political subjects to mere bare or naked life. In asking for a refusal to draw lines as a possibility of challenge, then, we are not asking for the elimination of power relations and consequently, we are not asking for the erasure of the possibility of a mode of political being that is empowered and empowering, is free and that speaks: quite the opposite. Following Agamben, we are suggesting that it is only through a refusal to draw any lines at all between forms of life (and indeed, nothing less will do) that sovereign power as a form of violence can be contested and a properly political power relation (a life of power as potenza) reinstated. We could call this challenging the logic of sovereign power through refusal. Our argument is that we can evade sovereign power and reinstate a form of power relation by contesting sovereign power’s assumption of the right to draw lines, that is, by contesting the sovereign ban. Any other challenge always inevitably remains within this relationship of violence. To move outside it (and return to a power relation) we need not only to contest its right to draw lines in particular places, but also to resist the call to draw any lines of the sort sovereign power demands.¶ The grammar of sovereign power cannot be resisted by challenging or fighting over where the lines are drawn. Whilst, of course, this is a strategy that can be deployed, it is not a challenge to sovereign power per se as it still tacitly or even explicitly accepts that lines must be drawn somewhere (and preferably more inclusively). Although such strategies contest the violence of sovereign power’s drawing of a particular line, they risk replicating such violence in demanding the line be drawn differently. This is because such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which, as Agamben points out, renders us all now homines sacri or bare life.¶ Taking Agamben’s conclusion on board, we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge.

The risk of a large increase in damaging forms of consumption would be greater at a lower price; the need for enforcement against illicit production and sale, or tax evasion by licensed producers and sellers, would be higher. Another central decision is whether to allow private for-profit enterprises to produce and sell cannabis, or instead to restrict licit activity to: (1) Production for personal use and free distribution only. (2) Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises such as consumer-owned cooperatives like the Spanish ‘cannabis clubs’ (3) Some variety of state monopoly, perhaps of retail sales only, leaving production to private enterprise. If the private enterprise model is chosen, an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration to ensure the existence of a variety of competing firms (thus perhaps limiting the marketing and political power of the industry as a whole and – again perhaps – increasing the rate of product innovation and the range of products easily available) or instead to allow the likely development of oligopolistic competition, as in the markets for cigarettes and beer.

The corresponding disadvantage might be the application of powerful marketing techniques to making excessive consumption seem desirable and fashionable. Cannabis is a more complex product than beer, with at least two and perhaps dozens of significantly psychoactive chemicals and, to date, only limited scientific knowledge about their actions and interactions. Requiring accurate label information about chemical content seems a sensible approach, but not all consumers will be able to make good use of a collection of chemical names and percentages. Industry participants could be given the responsibility of providing sound consumer information, including due warnings about the risks of habituation, at the point of sale or via websites, or that responsibility could be assigned to NGOs or public agencies, perhaps financed by cannabis taxation. It seems at least arguable that cannabis sales personnel should have extensive training both about the pharmacology of the drug and about offering good advice to consumers, making their role closer to that of a pharmacist or nutritionist than of a mere sales clerk or bartender. By the same token, decisions would have to be made and executed about whether and how to limit marketing efforts.

The second feature of commodification is that it reduces bonds with other human beings to formal covenants; it moves ""relationships"" into the territory of ""contracts,"" in a parallel way to which ""persons"" become ""things"" and are for sale relationships between people enter the market place. A view in which relationships are for sale runs counter to most philosophical accounts of persons, and most especially to those where individuals are intrinsically social beings, embedded in complex relations with others, as philosophers such as Aristotle (2004), Taylor (1992), and Sandel (1998) have argued. In the market, however, according to Marx (1844), workers are alienated (to maximize profits), not just from their labor, and its products, but from others, such that the market converts relationships between [humans] to relationships between property owners. Taking this as a whole, to commodify, is to de-emhasize that individuals are, constitutively, relational beings and have interdependent ties to others and particular needs and wants, and instead is to shift toward seeing the connections between individuals as interchangeable, established and disestablished as the market requires, and valued only in extrinsic monetary terms.

Please don't misunderstand this as appeal to a more effective return to the liberal-deliberative model. This path has been effectively short-circuited. The circuits are burned. They won't be rewired anytime soon, if ever. The circularity of the future cause at the heart of preemption as a positive and productive power, as a force of history in its own right, has seen to that. All signs indicate that political legitimation has moved onto an affective footing, as permanently and unrefusably as the spectrum of politics has moved onto a war footing. A logic of war has become the logic of politics. In the 19th century Clausewitz said that war is the continuation of politics by other means. Now politics is the continuation of war by the same means. There is likely no going back.
If resistance is possible, it must engage in that full-spectrum battlespace that has become the space of life. This means engaging the operative logic of preemption on its own terrains. This in turn means, in the most literal sense, a struggle for the future (perhaps through practices of slowness, against the preemptive addiction to rapid response?). It also means engaging it on the level of affect: reclaiming legitimation in a different affective key.

It is more appropriately considered to have become a form of governance or technique of administration through relationships of violence that reduce political subjects to mere bare or naked life. In asking for a refusal to draw lines as a possibility of challenge, then, we are not asking for the elimination of power relations and consequently, we are not asking for the erasure of the possibility of a mode of political being that is empowered and empowering, is free and that speaks: quite the opposite. Following Agamben, we are suggesting that it is only through a refusal to draw any lines at all between forms of life (and indeed, nothing less will do) that sovereign power as a form of violence can be contested and a properly political power relation (a life of power as potenza) reinstated. We could call this challenging the logic of sovereign power through refusal. Our argument is that we can evade sovereign power and reinstate a form of power relation by contesting sovereign power’s assumption of the right to draw lines, that is, by contesting the sovereign ban. Any other challenge always inevitably remains within this relationship of violence. To move outside it (and return to a power relation) we need not only to contest its right to draw lines in particular places, but also to resist the call to draw any lines of the sort sovereign power demands.¶ The grammar of sovereign power cannot be resisted by challenging or fighting over where the lines are drawn. Whilst, of course, this is a strategy that can be deployed, it is not a challenge to sovereign power per se as it still tacitly or even explicitly accepts that lines must be drawn somewhere (and preferably more inclusively). Although such strategies contest the violence of sovereign power’s drawing of a particular line, they risk replicating such violence in demanding the line be drawn differently. This is because such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which, as Agamben points out, renders us all now homines sacri or bare life.¶ Taking Agamben’s conclusion on board, we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge.

Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized","One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed. “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains. This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy. Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it. There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.” Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks. On the other hand, the hemp-food industry is “pretty well settled,” says Murphy. If hemp growing were legalized in the U.S., he adds, a lot of Canadian processors would probably open facilities here. Legalization would also help hemp food break out of its niche-market status. If it received “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the Food and Drug Administration, major brands would be less reluctant to use it. Until then, he says, Coca-Cola won’t put hemp milk in Odwalla Future Shakes, and we’re not likely to see hempseed Clif Bars. Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry, says Murphy. Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized in 1998. The nation’s production leaped to 35,000 acres in 1999 and plummeted to about 4,000 in 2001, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada’s main hemp-producing province.

The second feature of commodification is that it reduces bonds with other human beings to formal covenants; it moves ""relationships"" into the territory of ""contracts,"" in a parallel way to which ""persons"" become ""things"" and are for sale relationships between people enter the market place. A view in which relationships are for sale runs counter to most philosophical accounts of persons, and most especially to those where individuals are intrinsically social beings, embedded in complex relations with others, as philosophers such as Aristotle (2004), Taylor (1992), and Sandel (1998) have argued. In the market, however, according to Marx (1844), workers are alienated (to maximize profits), not just from their labor, and its products, but from others, such that the market converts relationships between [humans] to relationships between property owners. Taking this as a whole, to commodify, is to de-emhasize that individuals are, constitutively, relational beings and have interdependent ties to others and particular needs and wants, and instead is to shift toward seeing the connections between individuals as interchangeable, established and disestablished as the market requires, and valued only in extrinsic monetary terms.

It is more appropriately considered to have become a form of governance or technique of administration through relationships of violence that reduce political subjects to mere bare or naked life. In asking for a refusal to draw lines as a possibility of challenge, then, we are not asking for the elimination of power relations and consequently, we are not asking for the erasure of the possibility of a mode of political being that is empowered and empowering, is free and that speaks: quite the opposite. Following Agamben, we are suggesting that it is only through a refusal to draw any lines at all between forms of life (and indeed, nothing less will do) that sovereign power as a form of violence can be contested and a properly political power relation (a life of power as potenza) reinstated. We could call this challenging the logic of sovereign power through refusal. Our argument is that we can evade sovereign power and reinstate a form of power relation by contesting sovereign power’s assumption of the right to draw lines, that is, by contesting the sovereign ban. Any other challenge always inevitably remains within this relationship of violence. To move outside it (and return to a power relation) we need not only to contest its right to draw lines in particular places, but also to resist the call to draw any lines of the sort sovereign power demands.¶ The grammar of sovereign power cannot be resisted by challenging or fighting over where the lines are drawn. Whilst, of course, this is a strategy that can be deployed, it is not a challenge to sovereign power per se as it still tacitly or even explicitly accepts that lines must be drawn somewhere (and preferably more inclusively). Although such strategies contest the violence of sovereign power’s drawing of a particular line, they risk replicating such violence in demanding the line be drawn differently. This is because such forms of challenge fail to refuse sovereign power’s line-drawing ‘ethos’, an ethos which, as Agamben points out, renders us all now homines sacri or bare life.¶ Taking Agamben’s conclusion on board, we now turn to look at how the assumption of bare life can produce forms of challenge. Agamben puts it in terms of a transformation:¶ This biopolitical body that is bare life must itself instead be transformed into the site for the constitution and installation of a form of life that is wholly exhausted in bare life and a bios that is only its own zoe-.... If we give the name form-of-life to this being that is only its own bare existence and to this life that, being its own form, remains inseparable from it we will witness the emergence of a field of research beyond the terrain defined by the intersection of politics and philosophy, medico-biological sciences and jurisprudence.60",3019.0,"<h4>The links prove that the aff draws lines of legality – refuse that oscillation between inside and outside</h4><p><u><strong>Edkins and Pin-Fat 05.</u></strong> Jenny Edkins, professor of international politics at Prifysgol Aberystwyth University (in Wales) and Veronique Pin-Fat, senior lecturer in politics at Manchester Universit<u><strong>, “Through the Wire: Relations of Power and Relations of Violence,” Millennium - Journal of International Studies 2005 34: pg. 14</p><p></strong>One potential form of <mark>challenge to sovereign power consists of <strong>a refusal to draw any lines between </mark>zoe- and bios, <mark>inside and outside</u></mark>.</strong>59 As we have shown, <u><strong>sovereign power</strong> does not involve a power relation</u> in Foucauldian terms<u>.

The risk of a large increase in damaging forms of consumption would be greater at a lower price; the need for enforcement against illicit production and sale, or tax evasion by licensed producers and sellers, would be higher. Another central decision is whether to allow private for-profit enterprises to produce and sell cannabis, or instead to restrict licit activity to: (1) Production for personal use and free distribution only. (2) Production and sale by not-for-profit enterprises such as consumer-owned cooperatives like the Spanish ‘cannabis clubs’ (3) Some variety of state monopoly, perhaps of retail sales only, leaving production to private enterprise. If the private enterprise model is chosen, an additional choice must be made about whether to limit market concentration to ensure the existence of a variety of competing firms (thus perhaps limiting the marketing and political power of the industry as a whole and – again perhaps – increasing the rate of product innovation and the range of products easily available) or instead to allow the likely development of oligopolistic competition, as in the markets for cigarettes and beer. A potential advantage of legalisation would be the provision of consumer information superior to that available on the illicit market. The corresponding disadvantage might be the application of powerful marketing techniques to making excessive consumption seem desirable and fashionable. Cannabis is a more complex product than beer, with at least two and perhaps dozens of significantly psychoactive chemicals and, to date, only limited scientific knowledge about their actions and interactions. Requiring accurate label information about chemical content seems a sensible approach, but not all consumers will be able to make good use of a collection of chemical names and percentages. Industry participants could be given the responsibility of providing sound consumer information, including due warnings about the risks of habituation, at the point of sale or via websites, or that responsibility could be assigned to NGOs or public agencies, perhaps financed by cannabis taxation. It seems at least arguable that cannabis sales personnel should have extensive training both about the pharmacology of the drug and about offering good advice to consumers, making their role closer to that of a pharmacist or nutritionist than of a mere sales clerk or bartender. By the same token, decisions would have to be made and executed about whether and how to limit marketing efforts. To some eyes at least, the alcohol industry provides a warning by example of what could go wrong.

Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized","One problem for the industry is that hemp’s decades of illegality have left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it. As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch. To begin with, all the seed stock is gone, except for feral ditchweed. “You’d have to breed again for varieties that work well here,” he says. Kentucky was once a major hemp producer, and it also provided seeds for strains better suited to different latitudes, such as Wisconsin. There were also strains bred for fiber or for larger seeds that yielded more oil. Currently, Murphy says, Canada uses mostly Russian and European stock. Those seeds could also be cross-bred with local feral strains. This lack of infrastructure has been a major barrier to producing hemp clothing and paper. Building a new decorticator mill for hemp paper would cost more than $100 million, says Murphy. Several small companies are using hemp for specialized products such as archival-quality, filter, or cigarette papers, but its most likely general use will be when mixed with recycled paper, says Steenstra. “Blend in 10 to 15 percent hemp, and it’s great for making better-quality recycled paper,” he says. When paper gets recycled, he explains, its fibers get shorter, and the long fibers of hemp strengthen it. There are similar issues with clothing. Though Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Giorgio Armani, and several lesser-known manufacturers are using hemp in clothes, “the whole textile industry is built on short-fiber cotton and synthetics,” says Steenstra. “There’s no infrastructure for processing hemp fiber into textiles.” Hemp oil for biofuel, another use dreamed of in the ‘90s, is unlikely to be practical. At 50 gallons per acre, even if every acre of U.S. cropland were used for hemp, it would supply current U.S. demand for oil for less than three weeks. On the other hand, the hemp-food industry is “pretty well settled,” says Murphy. If hemp growing were legalized in the U.S., he adds, a lot of Canadian processors would probably open facilities here. Legalization would also help hemp food break out of its niche-market status. If it received “GRAS” (Generally Recognized As Safe) status from the Food and Drug Administration, major brands would be less reluctant to use it. Until then, he says, Coca-Cola won’t put hemp milk in Odwalla Future Shakes, and we’re not likely to see hempseed Clif Bars. Canada’s experience illustrates the problems of developing a new industry, says Murphy. Hemp farming there has been through two boom-and-bust cycles since it was legalized in 1998. The nation’s production leaped to 35,000 acres in 1999 and plummeted to about 4,000 in 2001, according to a report by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Alberta, Canada’s main hemp-producing province. It soared to 48,000 acres in 2006 and fell to less than 10,000 two years later.",2975.0,"<h4><u><strong>Hemp isn’t the silver bullet – long timeframe and boom-and-bust cycle</h4><p>Wishnia 13 </p><p></u></strong>[Steven Wishnia, Alternet Writer, SATURDAY, FEB 16, 2013 08:00 AM MST, “Can hemp save the economy?” http://www.salon.com/2013/02/16/politicians_are_pushing_to_bring_back_the_hemp_partner/<u><strong><mark>,]</p><p></strong></mark>One problem for the industry is that <mark>hemp’s </mark>decades of <mark>illegality</u> </mark>have <u><strong><mark>left almost no infrastructure for growing, processing and selling it</mark>.</u></strong> As no hemp has been grown legally in the U.S. since 1957, says Murphy, many parts of the industry would have to be re-established virtually from scratch.

In addition, Snyder's commentary includes a fundamentally Western concept: that spirituality is a universal, objective thing that all humans can experience equally, in an individual fashion. For example, Christianity often speaks of a ""personal relationship with Jesus."" Since in Western cultures, spirituality is woven almost exclusively into religion, Westerners have the concept of a ""one true way."" Indeed, if such a thing existed, it would be inhuman to deny that knowledge to all people; however, Indian spirituality is not based on the individual but rather on the community. Spiritual ties are completely dependent on the local culture and taken outside that cultural context, lose their meaning. There is no single ""Indian spirituality"" but each community would develop its own culturally-dependant ties to the spirit world.

It would be like stealing a bottle of spice from a master chef and believing that you then had the secret to greatcooking. Looking closely at the Western mindset at the root of this issue in Going Native, Huhndorf writes: In New Age practices, ‘Native’ traditions generally reflect a heavily European ethos. In this particular case, the fixation on self-discovery and self-healing 9 articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism. At the same time, the teacher’s selling of ‘Indian’ knowledge and experiences manifests a profoundly capitalist mindset. . . Because it distorts Native traditions and turns them into consumer goods, the New Age represents another, newer phase in European America’s colonization of Native America. This is true despite the movement’s claims to have freed itself from this troubling history. In fact, New Agers’ desire to go native reproduces, even as it extends, the history of colonization, shown in this case by the compulsion to own Native cultures and even Native identities (Hundorf 2001). It is not surprising, given this information to learn that the predominant market for New Age Indian spirituality is middle class, white and wanting to escape modernity’s ills via individual transformation (rather than political action) and the only way they know how to do this is as Aldred says, “through commercialization and purchase.

Indeed, if such a thing existed, it would be inhuman to deny that knowledge to all people; however, <u><mark>Indian spirituality is not based on the individual but</mark> rather on <mark>the community</mark>. Spiritual ties are <mark>completely dependent on the local culture</mark> <mark>and</mark> <mark>taken outside that cultural context, lose their meaning</mark>. There is no single ""Indian spirituality"" but each community would develop its own culturally-dependant ties to the spirit world. In this light, <mark>adopting Indian spirituality in a Western culture</u></mark> (or any culture outside of where it was created) <u><mark>is not only cultural theft, but also</mark> simply <mark>nonsensical</u></mark>. <u>It would be like stealing a bottle of spice from a master chef and believing that you then had the secret to greatcooking</u>. Looking closely at the Western mindset at the root of this issue in Going Native, Huhndorf writes: In New Age practices, ‘Native’ traditions generally reflect a heavily European ethos. In this particular case<u>, the fixation on self-discovery and self-healing</u> 9 <u>articulate the very Western ideologies of bourgeois individualism. At the same time, <mark>the </mark>teacher’s <mark>selling of ‘Indian’ knowledge</mark> <mark>and experiences </mark>manifests a profoundly capitalist mindset. . . Because it <mark>distorts Native traditions <strong>and turns them into consumer goods</strong></mark>, <mark>the New Age represents another</mark>, newer <mark>phase in European America’s colonization of Native America</u>.</mark> This is true despite the movement’s claims to have freed itself from this troubling history. In fact, New Agers’ desire to go native reproduces, even as it extends, the history of colonization, shown in this case by the compulsion to own Native cultures and even Native identities (Hundorf 2001). <u>It is not surprising, given this information to learn that <mark>the predominant market</mark> for New Age Indian spirituality <mark>is middle class, white and wanting to escape</mark> <mark>modernity’s ills via individual transformation (rather than political action)</mark> and the only way they know how to do this is as Aldred says, “<mark>through commercialization and purchase</mark>. This cycle does not end their alienation. They are still so removed from any recognition of social relations (much less historical conflict) that they cannot understand why Native American peoples themselves would object to their appropriations”</u> (Aldred 2000).</p>",1NR,Case,Ballots,430182,3,17009,./documents/ndtceda14/Baylor/EvZo/Baylor-Evans-Zoda-Neg-USC-Round2.docx,564719,N,USC,2,ASU CaRe,Ralph Paone,"1ac was online gambling decolonization

The Asia-Pacific region can be regarded as a zone of both relative insecurity and strategic stability. It contains some of the world’s most significant flashpoints – the Korean peninsula, the Taiwan Strait, the Siachen Glacier – where tensions between nations could escalate to the point of major war. It is replete with unresolved border issues; is a breeding ground for transnationa terrorism and the site of many terrorist activities (the Bali bombings, the Manila superferry bombing); and contains overlapping claims for maritime territories (the Spratly Islands, the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands) with considerable actual or potential wealth in resources such as oil, gas and fisheries. Finally, the Asia-Pacific is an area of strategic significance with many key sea lines of communication and important chokepoints. Yet despite all these potential crucibles of conflict, the Asia-Pacific, if not an area of serenity and calm, is certainly more stable than one might expect. To be sure, there are separatist movements and internal struggles, particularly with insurgencies, as in Thailand, the Philippines and Tibet. Since the resolution of the East Timor crisis, however, the region has been relatively free of open armed warfare. Separatism remains a challenge, but the break-up of states is unlikely. Terrorism is a nuisance, but its impact is contained. The North Korean nuclear issue, while not fully resolved, is at least moving toward a conclusion with the likely denuclearisation of the peninsula. Tensions between China and Taiwan, while always just beneath the surface, seem unlikely to erupt in open conflict any time soon, especially given recent Kuomintang Party victories in Taiwan and efforts by Taiwan and China to re-open informal channels of consultation as well as institutional relationships between organisations responsible for cross-strait relations. And while in Asia there is no strong supranational political entity like the European Union, there are many multilateral organisations and international initiatives dedicated to enhancing peace and stability, including the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation. In Southeast Asia, countries are united in a common geopolitical and economic organisation – the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) – which is dedicated to peaceful economic, social and cultural development, and to the promotion of regional peace and stability. ASEAN has played a key role in conceiving and establishing broader regional institutions such as the East Asian Summit, ASEAN+3 (China, Japan and South Korea) and the ASEAN Regional Forum.

741439,Deferral disad – the perm relies on a politics of hope which beholds the possibility of security’s affective recuperation – refuse this politics in favor of one governed by pause,Massumi ‘14,"Massumi ‘14 (Brian, professor in the Communication Department of the University of Montreal, “The Remains of the Day,” On Violence, Vol 1 2013-14)","the tendency I am diagnosing is self-operating. It operates independently of the personal qualities of those in power. As a person, I find Obama honorable and reasonable to a fault And yet … he has been swept up. His return to the deliberative reason of traditional liberal democratic process has been a tragi-comic failure But the way in which Obama has at the same time made the exception to the rules the rule, in the name of national security – that definitely works. It's likely to prove indefinitely effective. It is likely to be Obama's most lasting ""contribution"". It is what makes the ""everything has changed"" of 9-11 just ""more of the same."" For the unforeseable future. Because the unforeseeable future is threat, and that puts us right back in the loop.
Please don't misunderstand this as appeal to a more effective return to the liberal-deliberative model. This path has been effectively short-circuited. The circuits are burned. They won't be rewired ever. The circularity of the future cause at the heart of preemption as a positive and productive power, as a force of history in its own right, has seen to that. All signs indicate that political legitimation has moved onto an affective footing, as permanently and unrefusably as the spectrum of politics has moved onto a war footing.

As the price of a given drug rises, it creates additional profit opportunities for those willing to enter the drug trade. Since the drug market is illegal, and therefore, conducted underground, quality control is reduced compared to ""above ground"" markets. Drug users have few means available to determine which drugs are ""pure"" and have no recourse should they purchase a substance of inferior quality. Further, the underground market allows for less information sharing about products and vendors because transactions take place secretly to avoid authorities Consequently, more poor-quality drug products enter the market, which leads to a greater potential for poisoning and overdose. The illegality of drug use generates unintended ""potency effects,"" On the supply side, prohibition results in drug dealers carrying and selling more potent drugs. under prohibition, suppliers prefer to transport cocaine, as compared to marijuana, because cocaine is more potent and therefore more valuable per unit.  On the demand side, drug prices are driven up by prohibition, which causes drug users to seek ""more bang for their buck."" That is, since the overall cost of obtaining drugs is higher, more potent drugs are relatively cheaper than ""weak"" drugs. Because drug users must act illegally to obtain drugs, they seek to maximize the satisfaction or ""high"" from each dollar spent. drug users may switch from substances like marijuana to ""harder"" drugs like cocaine and heroin. Finally, drug users may employ more intense methods of drug use, such as injection. prohibition leads to a greater use of more potent substances, which increases the likelihood of overdose and drug-related death. these effects may be seen in the rate of unintended overdose deaths in the United States. In 1971, Nixon declared drugs to be a public menace Between 1990 and 2007 alone, overdose rates increased five-fold. n55 The most common sources of overdose deaths are higher potency drugs – mainly cocaine, heroin, and opioid painkillers. n56","The first unintended consequence of prohibition is that individuals are more likely to consume poisonous substances and overdose with the increase in drug prices. prohibition results in drug dealers carrying and selling more potent drugs suppliers prefer to transport cocaine because cocaine is more potent and therefore more valuable per unit drug prices are driven up by prohibition, which causes drug users to seek ""more bang for their buck. since the overall cost of obtaining drugs is higher, more potent drugs are relatively cheaper than ""weak"" drugs. drug users may switch to ""harder"" drugs like cocaine and heroin.

Consequently, more poor-quality drug products enter the market, which leads to a greater potential for poisoning and overdose.¶ The greater prevalence of poor-quality drugs is not the sole mechanism through which overdoses increase. The illegality of drug use generates unintended ""potency effects,"" which affect both the supply and demand sides of the drug market. On the supply side, prohibition results in drug dealers carrying and selling more potent drugs. Because drug laws increase the risk of selling low potency drugs, suppliers tend to substitute toward higher potency drugs. For example, under prohibition, suppliers prefer to transport cocaine, as compared to marijuana, because cocaine is more potent and therefore more valuable per unit.¶ On the demand side, drug prices are driven up by prohibition, which causes drug users to seek ""more bang for their buck."" That is, since the overall cost of obtaining drugs is higher, more potent drugs are relatively cheaper than ""weak"" drugs. Because drug users must act illegally to obtain drugs, they seek to maximize the satisfaction or ""high"" from each dollar spent. This dynamic manifests itself in [*1079] several ways. Drug users may switch from lower potency to higher potency within a given drug (for example, from marijuana with lower levels of THC to marijuana with higher levels of THC). Alternatively, drug users may switch from substances like marijuana to ""harder"" drugs like cocaine and heroin. Finally, drug users may employ more intense methods of drug use, such as injection.¶ Taking both sides of the market together, prohibition leads to a greater use of more potent substances, which increases the likelihood of overdose and drug-related death. Indeed, these effects may be seen in the rate of unintended overdose deaths in the United States.

Drug users have few means available to determine which drugs are ""pure"" and have no recourse should they purchase a substance of inferior quality. Further, the underground market allows for less information sharing about products and vendors because transactions take place secretly to avoid authorities</u></strong>. <u><strong>Consequently, more poor-quality drug products enter the market, which leads to a greater potential for poisoning and overdose.</u></strong>¶ The greater prevalence of poor-quality drugs is not the sole mechanism through which overdoses increase. <u><strong>The illegality of drug use generates unintended ""potency effects,""</u></strong> which affect both the supply and demand sides of the drug market. <u><strong>On the supply side, <mark>prohibition results in drug dealers carrying and selling more potent drugs</mark>.</u></strong> Because drug laws increase the risk of selling low potency drugs, suppliers tend to substitute toward higher potency drugs. For example, <u><strong>under prohibition, <mark>suppliers prefer to transport cocaine</mark>, as compared to marijuana, <mark>because cocaine is more potent and therefore more valuable per unit</mark>.</u></strong>¶<u><strong> On the demand side, <mark>drug prices are driven up by prohibition, which causes drug users to seek ""more bang for their buck.</mark>"" That is, <mark>since the overall cost of obtaining drugs is higher, more potent drugs are relatively cheaper than ""weak"" drugs.</u></strong></mark> <u><strong>Because drug users must act illegally to obtain drugs, they seek to maximize the satisfaction or ""high"" from each dollar spent.</u></strong> This dynamic manifests itself in [*1079] several ways. Drug users may switch from lower potency to higher potency within a given drug (for example, from marijuana with lower levels of THC to marijuana with higher levels of THC). Alternatively, <u><strong><mark>drug users may switch</mark> from substances like marijuana <mark>to ""harder"" drugs like cocaine and heroin.</u></strong></mark> <u><strong>Finally, drug users may employ more intense methods of drug use, such as injection.</u></strong>¶ Taking both sides of the market together, <u><strong>prohibition leads to a greater use of more potent substances, which increases the likelihood of overdose and drug-related death.</u></strong> Indeed, <u><strong>these effects may be seen in the rate of unintended overdose deaths in the United States.

Their <u><mark>concern was the loss of anonymity</mark> that exists <mark>in legal prostitution.

Despite the fact</mark> that if officially registered as prostitutes <mark>they would accrue pension funds</mark>, the women still pre ferred anonymity</u> (Schippers, 2002). <u>They wanted to leave prosti tution as quickly as possible with no legal record of having been in prostitution</u> (Daley, 2001). Similarly, <u><mark>despite attempts to unionize women in Germany</mark>’s $16.5 billion legal prostitution industry, the <mark>women not only avoided unions, they avoided registering</mark> with the government <mark>and</mark> they <mark>continued to engage in illegal prostitu tion</mark> in part because they felt that the remote areas where prostitu tion is zoned put them at increased, not decreased, risk of physical danger</u> (Taubitz, 2004).</p>",,1NC,Stigma,194350,9,17057,./documents/ndtceda14/Dartmouth/AvMa/Dartmouth-Avendano-Martin-Neg-Cedanats-Round1.docx,565292,N,Cedanats,1,Washington Elizondo-Micovic,Stone,"1AC - Prostitution

But what, I wonder, are Foucault’s specific motivations for entering this particular dialectic —what productive “distortions” or epistemic agitations do his observations provide to the discourse on selbstmord, or “self-murder”?  What use does Foucault make of caching these two critical sentences in Volume 1 of The History of Sexuality within a broader formulation of bio-power (a thing which, as we will see, is at once productive of and threatened by suicidality)? More precisely to the point: what are the implications for framing suicide as a kind of resistance vis-à-vis a technology of power that, in Foucault’s account, grows out of the seventeenth century? I contend that Foucault’s concern with suicide is allegoric. This is not to trivialize or understate the complexity of his diffuse consideration of the subject. What I mean here by allegoric is the sense that Walter Benjamin gives the term: a peculiarly methodological tool or turn used to explain a certain theory by reducing it to a specific, emblematic scenario. Foucault is interested in the intersticiality and peripherality which suicide embodies: a thing which operates “at the borders and in the interstices of power that was exercised over life” (HS 139). He is invested, moreover, in what discursively is yielded up by preserving the singularity of suicide as an event that, precisely because of its singularity, exceeds the regulative purview of biopower. But it is imperative that the consequential shortcomings of treating this matter “allegorically” (the likely deliberate disavowal of the bleakness and misery of real suicides) be resolved if a meaningful and engaged consideration of suicide is to be formed. This move, it seems, can only be accomplished by means of a complicity with “sociological analysis” in considering the question of how and under what pretenses to intervene in suicide. Indeed, if we accept Michael J. Cholbi’s provocative and convincing claim that there are situations in which suicide not only authorizes, but demands precisely the kind of coercive surveillance and brute interruption characteristic of the operations of biopower, we are forced also to acknowledge that Foucault’s theory of the suicidal astonishment needs some nuance. Additionally, in order to consider the broader question of the relationship between sovereignty and suicide I will look to an interview conducted by Elisabeth Roudinesco with Jacques Derrida, in which Derrida provides the possibility of thinking the death penalty as an event of disciplinary suicidalization. Derrida’s brief theorization—one might even call it an intimation—of the ways in which execution is made autodestruction, of the manner in which being condemned to death is discursively reformed into an event of taking one’s own life, is one which idiomatically exceeds the critical capacity of available theories and taxonomies of suicide, and will provide the primary means through which to consider a Derridean re-reading of biopolitics.",3081.0,"<h4>People who kill themselves aren’t thinking “wow this will totally show the elites that they can’t control me” – they’re probably experiencing extreme depression and isolation.

A recent statistical analysis by the political scientist Michael Horowitz demonstrated that inexperienced nuclear powers tend to be more crisis-prone than other types of states, and research by another political scientist, Robert Rauchhaus, has found that nuclear states are more likely to engage in low-level militarized disputes with one another, even if they are less likely to engage in full-scale war.

A policy that favors preventive warfare expresses a futile quest for absolute security. It could do so. Most controversial policies contain within them the possibility of misuse. In the hands of a paranoid or boundlessly ambitious political leader, prevention could be a policy for endless warfare. However, the American political system, with its checks and balances, was designed explicitly for the purpose of constraining the executive from excessive folly. Both the Vietnam and the contemporary Iraqi experiences reveal clearly that although the conduct of war is an executive prerogative, in practice that authority is disciplined by public attitudes. Clausewitz made this point superbly with his designation of the passion, the sentiments, of the people as a vital component of his trinitarian theory of war. 51 It is true to claim that power can be, and indeed is often, abused, both personally and nationally. It is possible that a state could acquire a taste for the apparent swift decisiveness of preventive warfare and overuse the option. One might argue that the easy success achieved against Taliban Afghanistan in 2001, provided fuel for the urge to seek a similarly rapid success against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. In other words, the delights of military success can be habit forming. On balance, claim seven is not persuasive, though it certainly contains a germ of truth. A country with unmatched wealth and power, unused to physical insecurity at home—notwithstanding 42 years of nuclear danger, and a high level of gun crime—is vulnerable to demands for policies that supposedly can restore security. But we ought not to endorse the argument that the United States should eschew the preventive war option because it could lead to a futile, endless search for absolute security. One might as well argue that the United States should adopt a defense policy and develop capabilities shaped strictly for homeland security approached in a narrowly geographical sense. Since a president might misuse a military instrument that had a global reach, why not deny the White House even the possibility of such misuse? In other words, constrain policy ends by limiting policy’s military means. This argument has circulated for many decades and, it must be admitted, it does have a certain elementary logic. It is the opinion of this enquiry, however, that the claim that a policy which includes the preventive option might lead to a search for total security is not at all convincing. Of course, folly in high places is always possible, which is one of the many reasons why popular democracy is the superior form of government. It would be absurd to permit the fear of a futile and dangerous quest for absolute security to preclude prevention as a policy option. Despite its absurdity, this rhetorical charge against prevention is a stock favorite among prevention’s critics.

However, the American </mark>political <mark>system</mark>, with its checks and balances, <mark>was designed</mark> explicitly <mark>for</mark> <mark>the purpose of constraining the executive</mark> from </u>excessive <u>folly. Both the <mark>Vietnam</mark> <mark>and</mark> the contemporary <mark>Iraq</u></mark>i<u> experiences <mark>reveal</mark> clearly that</u> although <u>the conduct of <mark>war is</u></mark> an executive prerogative, in practice that authority is <u><mark>disciplined by public attitudes</u></mark>. Clausewitz made this point superbly with his designation of the passion, the sentiments, of the people as a vital component of his trinitarian theory of war. 51 It is true to claim that power can be, and indeed is often, abused, both personally and nationally. It is possible that a state could acquire a taste for the apparent swift decisiveness of preventive warfare and overuse the option. One might argue that the easy success achieved against Taliban Afghanistan in 2001, provided fuel for the urge to seek a similarly rapid success against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. In other words, the delights of military success can be habit forming. On balance, claim seven is not persuasive, though it certainly contains a germ of truth. A country with unmatched wealth and power, unused to physical insecurity at home—notwithstanding 42 years of nuclear danger, and a high level of gun crime—is vulnerable to demands for policies that supposedly can restore security. But<u> we ought not to endorse the argument </u>that <u>the U</u>nited <u>S</u>tates <u>should eschew the preventive war option because it could lead to a futile, endless search for absolute security. One might as well argue that</u> the United States should adopt a defense policy and develop capabilities shaped strictly for homeland security approached in a narrowly geographical sense. <u>Since a president might misuse a military instrument that had a global reach, why not deny the White House even the possibility of such misuse? In other words, constrain policy ends by limiting policy’s military means. </u>This argument has circulated for many decades and, it must be admitted, it does have a certain elementary logic. It is the opinion of this enquiry, however, that <u><mark>the claim that a policy which includes the preventive option might lead to a search</mark> <mark>for total security is <strong>not </mark>at all <mark>convincing</u></strong></mark>. Of course, folly in high places is always possible, which is one of the many reasons why popular democracy is the superior form of government<u>. It would be absurd to permit the fear of a futile and dangerous quest for absolute security to preclude prevention as a policy option. Despite its absurdity, this rhetorical charge against prevention is a stock favorite among prevention’s critics. <mark>It should be</mark> recognized and <mark>dismissed for</mark> <mark>what it is, a debating point with little pragmatic merit. </mark>And strategy</u>, though not always policy, <u><strong>must be nothing if not pragmatic.</p></u></strong>",,1nc,Case,91690,348,17065,./documents/ndtceda14/Dartmouth/KrAh/Dartmouth-Kreus-Ahmad-Neg-Hurricanedebates2015-Round7.docx,565287,N,Hurricanedebates2015,7,Florida Cone-Marchini,Lee,"FW (2NR)

In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it is difficult  to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem (Brock  1997, Waever 1995). Securitization regularly leads to all-round ‘exceptionalism’ in dealing  with the issue as well as to a shift in institutional localization towards ‘security experts’ (Bigot  2006), such as the military and police. Methods and instruments associated with these security  organizations – such as more use of arms, force and violence – will gain in importance in the  discourse on ‘what to do’. A good example of securitization was the period leading to the  Cold War (Guzzini 2004 ). Originally a political conflict over the organization of societies, in  the late 1940s, the East-West confrontation became an existential conflict that was  overwhelmingly addressed with military means, including the potential annihilation of  humankind. Efforts to alleviate the political conflict were, throughout most of the Cold War,  secondary to improving military capabilities. Climate change could meet a similar fate. An essentially political problem concerning the  distribution of the costs of prevention and adaptation and the losses and gains in income  arising from change in the human environment might be perceived as intractable, thus  necessitating the build-up of military and police forces to prevent it from becoming a major  security problem. The portrayal of climate change as a security problem could, in particular,  cause the richer countries in the global North, which are less affected by it, to strengthen  measures aimed at protecting them from the spillover of violent conflict from the poorer  countries in the global South that will be most affected by climate change. It could also be  used by major powers as a justification for improving their military preparedness against the  other major powers, thus leading to arms races. This kind of reaction to climate change would be counterproductive in various ways. Firstly,  since more border protection, as well as more soldiers and arms, is expensive, the financial means compensate for the negative economic effects of reducing greenhouse gas emission  and adapting to climate change will be reduced. Global military expenditure is again at the  level of the height of the Cold War in real terms, reaching more than US $1,200 billion in  2006 or 3.5 percent of global income. While any estimate of the costs of mitigation (e.g. of  restricting global warming to 2°C by 2050) and adaptation are speculative at the moment,1  they are likely to be substantial. While there is no necessary link between higher military  expenditures and a lower willingness to spend on preventing and preparing for climate  change, both policy areas are in competition for scarce resources.",2969.0,"<h4><strong>And, if successful, apocalyptic representations of climate change lead to great power war – regional interventions and arms races</h4><p>Brzoska </strong>(Inst. for Peace Research and Security Policy @ Hamburg) <strong>8 </p><p><u></strong>(Micahel, “The Securitization of climate change and the power of conceptions of security” ISA Convention Paper)</p><p></u>In the literature on securitization it is implied that when a problem is securitized it is difficult  to limit this to an increase in attention and resources devoted to mitigating the problem (Brock  1997, Waever 1995).

This paper assumes that the success of a multilateral trade negotiation depends on the power of the DSU to provide remedies against unfair trade practices,2 because if the remedial measures are not effective then it will induce violation of commitments. As a result, deadlocks in trade negotiations will fail the purpose of the Ministerial Conference. Examining the provisions of the DSU, this paper finds that it has considerable insufficiencies. Because of the insufficiencies it is practically very difficult for a country, especially for the small-developing ones, to get adequate relief against unfair trade practices. The provisions of the DSU only allow retaliatory measures against a country using unfair trade practices. If a small-developing country is affected by such unfair trade practices used by a developed country, then it is virtually impossible for that small-developing country to “retaliate” against the developed country, because in reality most of the developing countries are heavily dependent on few developed countries/regions, for example, to sell their exportable items. Our regression analyses show that the countries with considerable financial strength, versatile tradable items and large trade share not only tend to use the dispute settlement mechanism more but also win more disputes than the countries with low financial strength and small trade share. In addition, we also find that if a dispute is prolonged then it may favor the developed countries at the expense of the small-developing ones. These results provide logic for the empirical finding that the developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, participate in fewer trade disputes than the developed countries.21 Apparently the WTO does not have anything to do with the financial strength or the trade share of a country. However, the gap of financial power between the developed and the developing countries may be neutralized by providing the latter with intensified legal and technical assistance during the litigation process of a dispute. To encourage the developing countries to participate more in the dispute settlement process, the WTO should replace the provision of retaliation by introducing more meaningful measure, such as financial compensation instead of retaliation, in the system. 22 At the same time, the WTO should also take necessary steps to resolve the disputed matters within the time-frame stipulated in the DSU.

What use does Foucault make of caching these two critical sentences in Volume 1 of The History of Sexuality within a broader formulation of bio-power (a thing which, as we will see, is at once productive of and threatened by suicidality)? More precisely to the point: what are the implications for framing suicide as a kind of resistance vis-à-vis a technology of power that, in Foucault’s account, grows out of the seventeenth century? I contend that Foucault’s concern with suicide is allegoric. This is not to trivialize or understate the complexity of his diffuse consideration of the subject. What I mean here by allegoric is the sense that Walter Benjamin gives the term: a peculiarly methodological tool or turn used to explain a certain theory by reducing it to a specific, emblematic scenario. Foucault is interested in the intersticiality and peripherality which suicide embodies: a thing which operates “at the borders and in the interstices of power that was exercised over life” (HS 139). He is invested, moreover, in what discursively is yielded up by preserving the singularity of suicide as an event that, precisely because of its singularity, exceeds the regulative purview of biopower.

Additionally, in order to consider the broader question of the relationship between sovereignty and suicide I will look to an interview conducted by Elisabeth Roudinesco with Jacques Derrida, in which Derrida provides the possibility of thinking the death penalty as an event of disciplinary suicidalization. Derrida’s brief theorization—one might even call it an intimation—of the ways in which execution is made autodestruction, of the manner in which being condemned to death is discursively reformed into an event of taking one’s own life, is one which idiomatically exceeds the critical capacity of available theories and taxonomies of suicide, and will provide the primary means through which to consider a Derridean re-reading of biopolitics.",3081.0,"<h4>Their authors misread Foucault – he didn’t actually think suicide is itself resistance, just that it illustrates a point about biopower – the aff doesn’t do anything.

It included all the GATT provisions plus improved by adding new Agreements covering key sectors and issues of international trade. Yet, two out of six Ministerial Conferences of the WTO completely failed as the countries at the negotiation table could not reach any agreeable solution.20 In addition, although the Doha Conference produced promising Doha Development Agenda (DDA), the commitments laid in the DDA have not yet been fulfilled. This paper assumes that the success of a multilateral trade negotiation depends on the power of the DSU to provide remedies against unfair trade practices,2 because if the remedial measures are not effective then it will induce violation of commitments. As a result, deadlocks in trade negotiations will fail the purpose of the Ministerial Conference. Examining the provisions of the DSU, this paper finds that it has considerable insufficiencies. Because of the insufficiencies it is practically very difficult for a country, especially for the small-developing ones, to get adequate relief against unfair trade practices. The provisions of the DSU only allow retaliatory measures against a country using unfair trade practices. If a small-developing country is affected by such unfair trade practices used by a developed country, then it is virtually impossible for that small-developing country to “retaliate” against the developed country, because in reality most of the developing countries are heavily dependent on few developed countries/regions, for example, to sell their exportable items. Our regression analyses show that the countries with considerable financial strength, versatile tradable items and large trade share not only tend to use the dispute settlement mechanism more but also win more disputes than the countries with low financial strength and small trade share. In addition, we also find that if a dispute is prolonged then it may favor the developed countries at the expense of the small-developing ones. These results provide logic for the empirical finding that the developing countries, especially the least-developed ones, participate in fewer trade disputes than the developed countries.21 Apparently the WTO does not have anything to do with the financial strength or the trade share of a country. However, the gap of financial power between the developed and the developing countries may be neutralized by providing the latter with intensified legal and technical assistance during the litigation process of a dispute. To encourage the developing countries to participate more in the dispute settlement process, the WTO should replace the provision of retaliation by introducing more meaningful measure, such as financial compensation instead of retaliation, in the system. 22 At the same time, the WTO should also take necessary steps to resolve the disputed matters within the time-frame stipulated in the DSU.

Gholz and Press analyzed every major oil disruption since 1973.

The idea that such oil shocks will inevitably wreak havoc on the US economy has become deeply rooted in the American psyche, and in turn the United States has made ensuring the smooth flow of crude from the Middle East a central tenet of its foreign policy. Oil security is one of the primary reasons America has a long-term military presence in the region. Even aside from the Iraq and Afghan wars, we have equipment and forces positioned in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar; the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet is permanently stationed in Bahrain.  But a growing body of economic research suggests that this conventional view of oil shocks is wrong. The US economy is far less susceptible to interruptions in the oil supply than previously assumed, according to these studies. Scholars examining the recent history of oil disruptions have found the worldwide oil market to be remarkably adaptable and surprisingly quick at compensating for shortfalls. Economists have found that much of the damage once attributed to oil shocks can more persuasively be laid at the feet of bad government policies. The US economy, meanwhile, has become less dependent on Persian Gulf oil and less sensitive to changes in crude prices overall than it was in 1973.  These findings have led a few bold political scientists and foreign policy experts to start asking an uncomfortable question: If the United States could withstand a disruption in Persian Gulf oil supplies, why does it need a permanent military presence in the region at all? There’s a lot riding on that question: America’s presence in the Middle East exacts a heavy toll in political capital, financial resources, and lives. Washington’s support for Middle East autocrats makes America appear hypocritical on issues of human rights and democracy. The United States spends billions of dollars every year to maintain troops in the Middle East, and the troops risk their lives simply by being there, since they make tempting targets for the region’s Islamic extremists. And arguably, because the presence of these forces inflames radicals and delegitimizes local rulers, they may actually be undermining the very stability they are ostensibly there to ensure.  Among those asking this tough question are two young professors, Eugene Gholz, at the University of Texas, and Daryl Press, at Dartmouth College. To find out what actually happens when the world’s petroleum supply is interrupted, the duo analyzed every major oil disruption since 1973.

New research suggests the answer is no -- and that a major tenet of American foreign policy may be fundamentally wrong. By  February 13, 2011  http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2011/02/13/crude_reality/<u>]</p><p></u>Economists have a term for this disruption: an oil shock. <u>The idea that such oil shocks will inevitably wreak havoc on the US economy has become deeply rooted in the American psyche</u>, and in turn the United States has made ensuring the smooth flow of crude from the Middle East a central tenet of its foreign policy. Oil security is one of the primary reasons America has a long-term military presence in the region. Even aside from the Iraq and Afghan wars, we have equipment and forces positioned in Oman, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Qatar; the US Navy’s Fifth Fleet is permanently stationed in Bahrain.  <u>But a <mark>growing body of economic research suggests</mark> that this <mark>conventional view of oil shocks is wrong</mark>. The <mark>US economy is <strong>far less susceptible</strong> to interruptions in</mark> the oil <mark>supply than previously assumed</u></mark>, according to these studies. <u><mark>Scholars examining</mark> the <mark>recent</mark> history of <mark>oil disruptions</mark> have <mark>found the worldwide oil market to be <strong>remarkably adaptable</strong> and <strong>surprisingly quick at compensating for shortfalls</strong></mark>. Economists have found that much of the damage once attributed to oil shocks can more persuasively be laid at the feet of bad government policies. <mark>The US economy</mark>, meanwhile, <mark>has become <strong>less dependent</strong> on Persian Gulf oil and less sensitive to changes in crude prices</mark> overall <mark>than</mark> it was <mark>in</mark> 19<mark>73</mark>.</u>  These findings have led a few bold political scientists and foreign policy experts to start asking an uncomfortable question: If the United States could withstand a disruption in Persian Gulf oil supplies, why does it need a permanent military presence in the region at all? There’s a lot riding on that question: America’s presence in the Middle East exacts a heavy toll in political capital, financial resources, and lives. Washington’s support for Middle East autocrats makes America appear hypocritical on issues of human rights and democracy. The United States spends billions of dollars every year to maintain troops in the Middle East, and the troops risk their lives simply by being there, since they make tempting targets for the region’s Islamic extremists. And arguably, because the presence of these forces inflames radicals and delegitimizes local rulers, they may actually be undermining the very stability they are ostensibly there to ensure.  Among those asking this tough question are two young professors, Eugene <u><mark>Gholz</u></mark>, at the University of Texas, <u><mark>and</u></mark> Daryl <u><mark>Press</u></mark>, at Dartmouth College.

The argument goes something like this: as history has shown, marijuana use will not stop; therefore, we might as well sell the drug legally, putting the money from drug dealers’ wallets into those of the people.136 Although this is generally a sound and sensible argument, for minority groups it might truthfully represent another tool of economic oppression bogging down their communities. In the illegal market, high-quality marijuana costs, on average, over $4,000 per pound, while lower level marijuana nears $1,000 per pound.137 As noted earlier, marijuana sales in the United States, top $100 billion annually.138 As also noted, the highest concentration of drug dealers is found in lower income, urban environments prone to minority dwelling.139 These figures tend to reflect that billions, and at the very least hundreds of millions, of dollars are funneled into such lower income communities each year. With the legalization of marijuana, money expended by consumers will be the same or higher, but minorities must ask where that money will drain. Meaning, will the billions or hundreds of millions of dollars continue their current flow into lower income communities, or will forces divert the money elsewhere? The California initiative created licensing regulations for both the growing140 and the selling141 of marijuana. To the detriment of minorities, these licensing requirements required both money and a certain amount of business prowess: cultivating or growing marijuana would require 1) a maximum license fee of $5,000 paid by all applicants to ""reasonably cover the costs of assuring compliance with the regulations to be issued"";142 2) all license applicants to submit to a criminal history background check;143 3) appropriate security and security plans with ""satisfactory proof of the financial ability of the licensee to provide for that security"";144 and 4) compliance with other employment,145 inspection,146 and recordkeeping147 measures. These business and licensing regulations provided no assistance to entrepreneurs with little or no start-up capital. Therefore, marijuana, if legalized in the California fashion, while becoming the nation’s next cash crop and a tremendous source of wealth, could potentially be so for mainly non-minorities, ones who have the financial means and business savvy to initiate such production.

The new industrial policies emphasized the importance of foreign capital and industrial know- how. The Indian government carried out liberal FDI policies and incentives to invite foreign firms to start manufacturing facilities in order to get an inflow of know- how in the sector. The leading pharmaceutical companies from the West came to India and established manufacturing facilities. Subsequently, the multinationals brought in technology and international manufacturing practices26. Domestic firms were encouraged to tie up with foreign firms, with participation in capital, and there were collaboration agreements in the private sector. The foreign firm Hoechst established a research centre, which enhanced basic research in India27 .

The argument goes something like this: as history has shown, marijuana use will not stop; therefore, we might as well sell the drug legally, putting the money from drug dealers’ wallets into those of the people.136 Although this is generally a sound and sensible argument, for minority groups it might truthfully represent another tool of economic oppression bogging down their communities. In the illegal market, high-quality marijuana costs, on average, over $4,000 per pound, while lower level marijuana nears $1,000 per pound.137 As noted earlier, marijuana sales in the United States, top $100 billion annually.138 As also noted, the highest concentration of drug dealers is found in lower income, urban environments prone to minority dwelling.139 These figures tend to reflect that billions, and at the very least hundreds of millions, of dollars are funneled into such lower income communities each year. With the legalization of marijuana, money expended by consumers will be the same or higher, but minorities must ask where that money will drain. Meaning, will the billions or hundreds of millions of dollars continue their current flow into lower income communities, or will forces divert the money elsewhere? The California initiative created licensing regulations for both the growing140 and the selling141 of marijuana. To the detriment of minorities, these licensing requirements required both money and a certain amount of business prowess: cultivating or growing marijuana would require 1) a maximum license fee of $5,000 paid by all applicants to ""reasonably cover the costs of assuring compliance with the regulations to be issued"";142 2) all license applicants to submit to a criminal history background check;143 3) appropriate security and security plans with ""satisfactory proof of the financial ability of the licensee to provide for that security"";144 and 4) compliance with other employment,145 inspection,146 and recordkeeping147 measures. These business and licensing regulations provided no assistance to entrepreneurs with little or no start-up capital. Therefore, marijuana, if legalized in the California fashion, while becoming the nation’s next cash crop and a tremendous source of wealth, could potentially be so for mainly non-minorities, ones who have the financial means and business savvy to initiate such production. Worsening this dilemma, most of the money flowing into the minority communities from the illegal sale of marijuana would be diverted into the bank accounts of the new class of ""marijuana business[man].""148 Minority community leaders should be mindful of this potential money drain, and wary of its wide range of effects on their communities.149",3078.0,"<h4>Legalization would increase poverty and be inaccessible to minority communities</h4><p><strong>Moran 2011</strong> (Thomas, Juris Doctor, Washington and Lee University School of Law 2011, Just a Little Bit of History Repeating: The California Model of Marijuana Legalization and How it Might Affect Racial and Ethnic Minorities, Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice Volume 17 | Issue 2 Article 8, http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1286&context=crsj&sei-redir=1)</p><p>C.

A policy that favors preventive warfare expresses a futile quest for absolute security. It could do so. Most controversial policies contain within them the possibility of misuse. In the hands of a paranoid or boundlessly ambitious political leader, prevention could be a policy for endless warfare. However, the American political system, with its checks and balances, was designed explicitly for the purpose of constraining the executive from excessive folly. Both the Vietnam and the contemporary Iraqi experiences reveal clearly that although the conduct of war is an executive prerogative, in practice that authority is disciplined by public attitudes. Clausewitz made this point superbly with his designation of the passion, the sentiments, of the people as a vital component of his trinitarian theory of war. 51 It is true to claim that power can be, and indeed is often, abused, both personally and nationally. It is possible that a state could acquire a taste for the apparent swift decisiveness of preventive warfare and overuse the option. One might argue that the easy success achieved against Taliban Afghanistan in 2001, provided fuel for the urge to seek a similarly rapid success against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. In other words, the delights of military success can be habit forming. On balance, claim seven is not persuasive, though it certainly contains a germ of truth. A country with unmatched wealth and power, unused to physical insecurity at home—notwithstanding 42 years of nuclear danger, and a high level of gun crime—is vulnerable to demands for policies that supposedly can restore security. But we ought not to endorse the argument that the United States should eschew the preventive war option because it could lead to a futile, endless search for absolute security. One might as well argue that the United States should adopt a defense policy and develop capabilities shaped strictly for homeland security approached in a narrowly geographical sense. Since a president might misuse a military instrument that had a global reach, why not deny the White House even the possibility of such misuse? In other words, constrain policy ends by limiting policy’s military means. This argument has circulated for many decades and, it must be admitted, it does have a certain elementary logic. It is the opinion of this enquiry, however, that the claim that a policy which includes the preventive option might lead to a search for total security is not at all convincing.

This major change will advance the wave of legalized gambling Internet gambling has the potential to spread pervasively with state cooperation states are seriously and quickly expanding","Two days before Christmas in 2011, President Obama gave an unexpected gift to the states. n1 With a thirteen-page legal memorandum (""Memorandum""), the Obama Administration reversed an aggressive, decades-old Department of Justice (""DOJ"") position and opened the door for states to legalize almost every form of Internet gambling without interference from federal laws. n2 Through the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (""OLC""), the Obama Administration announced that the major federal anti-gambling statute, the Wire Act, n3 now applies only to bets on sports events and races. By issuing a clear interpretation of previously vague and inconsistent federal gambling laws, the Executive Branch maneuvered what Congress could not: it turned oversight of Internet gambling operations over to states.
The impacts of land-based casino gambling are long debated, n4 but Internet gaming is a recently developed industry. Opponents have compared online gambling to crack cocaine, n5 but it has also been described  [*656]  as inevitable and unstoppable. n6 Americans have made Internet bets in the hundreds of millions of dollars to the benefit of offshore illegal and gray market operations. n7 President Obama's Christmas Memorandum was a gift to states worth billions of dollars in new tax revenue and thousands of new jobs. After this thirteen-page reversal, expect a quick departure to uncharted territory for the United States: legal Internet gambling.
Part II of this Article explains the complicated, interlocked set of federal gaming laws at issue. These laws are critical to federal enforcement of state gambling laws and to federal involvement in states' decisions about what forms of gambling they might want to regulate. The law addressed in the Memorandum, the Wire Act, was the most important weapon the DOJ used to prevent states from authorizing Internet gambling, but it is not the only federal barrier to state-authorized gambling.
Part III discusses the tension among these federal laws, which at times undermine and contradict one another. With no legislative solution in sight, the Memorandum offers a clean solution and interprets the law to eliminate most, though not all, of the problems.
Part IV explores the explosion of Internet gambling, which is soon to be legalized by the states.

Gregg Harper, R-Miss., witnessed a demonstration in which a single remote computer took control of two computers and used them as alias machines to play poker online. The Harper demonstration showed the technology and techniques that terror and crime organizations could use to operate untraceable money laundering built on a highly liquid legalized online poker industry — just the environment that will result from the spread of poker online. One of us set up a website — undetectablelaundering.com — to help communicate the problem to a broader audience.

Caesar's Entertainment is currently under investigation by the Justice Department and IRS, accused of money laundering and Bank Secrecy Act violations. In December 2012, the FBI's Tampa field office asked us to take down the website explaining the threat. We complied. This May, special agents at FBI headquarters in Washington responsible for enforcing the Wire Act and all other federal gambling laws were briefed on the vulnerability. In July, a Senate Commerce Committee hearing seemed to reinforce concerns. Rep. C.W. Bill Young wrote a letter of concern to FBI director Robert Mueller on Aug. 7. But since then action seems to have stalled. And the threat moves on. With the passing of Young, we have put the website back up and joined together in hopes of spurring action. Since it remains true that gambling regulations in Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey are no match for determined terrorists and criminals, we feel duty-bound as responsible citizens to ensure knowledge of the threat reaches as many policymakers as possible.

Unless there’s an unexpected shock to public opinion, it’s going to happen, and sooner rather than later.  The important debate now is how to legalize it.

Substantive comments are welcome. Rant and snark will be ruthlessly zapped.
We probably should legalize cannabis. Prohibition is now breaking down. $35B/yr. is a lot of money to give to criminals, and no one has a plausible plan to shrink the illicit market under prohibition. Even where “medical marijuana” has degenerated into system when anyone can buy a user license from a crooked doctor, the voters still like it. Arguably, prohibition was worth trying. But it’s time to go home.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages. Cannabis legalization will reduce criminal revenue, intrusive enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and disorder around illicit markets, and enhance personal liberty, consumer choice, and respect for the law, and probably reduce bloodshed in Mexico. It might foster safer and more beneficial practices of cannabis use.
Legalization will certainly increase drug abuse, including heavy use by minors. Every adult is a potential source of leakage to minors. And if we insist on making minors consume illicitly-produced pot, we reserve 20-25% of the market for criminals. Much better to tolerate leakage and have a grey-market supply to minors like the current system that provides them with alcohol.
The polarized nature of the debate means that both sides wind up spending lots of time denying the obvious.
Good design tries to get as much of the advantages, and as little of the disadvantages, as possible.
The policies most likely to help control increases in drug abuse are taxation and other efforts to keep prices high, rules about consumer information (labeling and marketing), and “nudge” strategies to enhance consumer mindfulness.
It matters a lot whether, under conditions of legality, cannabis turns out to be a substitute for alcohol or instead a complement. Right now, no one knows the answer, which might not be the same for all parts of the population or the same in the long run as in the short run.
Analysis can help, but there’s no substitute for experience. The trick is not to get locked in to a set of bad policies. We need a process designed to learn from mistakes.

The final outcome addresses a dog that hasn’t barked: the effect of the Great Recession on cross-border conflict and violence. During the initial stages of the crisis, multiple analysts asserted that the financial crisis would lead states to increase their use of force as a tool for staying in power.37 Whether through greater internal repression, diversionary wars, arms races, or a ratcheting up of great power conflict, there were genuine concerns that the global economic downturn would lead to an increase in conflict. Violence in the Middle East, border disputes in the South China Sea, and even the disruptions of the Occupy movement fuel impressions of surge in global public disorder.
The aggregate data suggests otherwise, however. The Institute for Economics and Peace has constructed a “Global Peace Index” annually since 2007. A key conclusion they draw from the 2012 report is that “The average level of peacefulness in 2012 is approximately the same as it was in 2007.”38 Interstate violence in particular has declined since the start of the financial crisis – as have military expenditures in most sampled countries. Other studies confirm that the Great Recession has not triggered any increase in violent conflict; the secular decline in violence that started with the end of the Cold War has not been reversed.39 Rogers Brubaker concludes, “the crisis has not to date generated the surge in protectionist nationalism or ethnic exclusion that might have been expected.”40
None of these data suggest that the global economy is operating swimmingly. Growth remains unbalanced and fragile, and has clearly slowed in 2012. Transnational capital flows remain depressed compared to pre-crisis levels, primarily due to a drying up of cross-border interbank lending in Europe. Currency volatility remains an ongoing concern. Compared to the aftermath of other postwar recessions, growth in output, investment, and employment in the developed world have all lagged behind. But the Great Recession is not like other postwar recessions in either scope or kind; expecting a standard “V”-shaped recovery was unreasonable. One financial analyst characterized the post-2008 global economy as in a state of “contained depression.”41 The key word is “contained,” however. Given the severity, reach and depth of the 2008 financial crisis, the proper comparison is with Great Depression. And by that standard, the outcome variables look impressive.

I think some additional context is necessary here.
The administration is currently in the midst of negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that is currently being negotiated between the United States and twelve other countries, including some of the world’s largest economies, such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico.
The Asia-Pacific region represents more than forty percent of the world’s trade.  And, as a group, TPP countries represent the largest goods and services export market for the United States.
On the other side of the world, the U.S. is negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the twenty-eight countries of the European Union.
The United States and the EU generate over half of the world’s economic output.
Total goods trade alone between the U.S. and EU amounts to over one trillion dollars a year.
Investment flows represent another three-hundred billion dollars a year.
Together, these two trade agreements have the potential to greatly expand access for U.S. products into foreign markets around the world.  Most importantly, they would help to grow our economy and create jobs here at home.
These two separate trade negotiations represent what is the most ambitious trade agenda in our nation’s recent history.  While everyone knows that I’m a pretty outspoken critic of the Obama Administration, I believe they deserve credit on this front.
But, if these negotiations are going to succeed, Congress must approve TPA.  Because of the unique structure of our government, our country needs TPA.
Our trading partners will not put their best deal on the table unless they know the United States can deliver on what we promise.
TPA empowers our trade negotiators to conclude agreements and provides a path for passage in Congress.
That is why every president since FDR has sought Trade Promotion Authority.  No economically significant trade agreement has ever been negotiated by any administration and approved by Congress without it.
Put simply, if Congress does not renew TPA, the TPP negotiations and those with the European Union will almost certainly fail.  That is why it is so disconcerting to me to see how some of my colleagues across the aisle have responded to President Obama’s call for TPA renewal.
TPA is one of the few issues where both parties can and should be able work together to achieve a common goal.  I know that I, along with my Republican colleagues, stand ready and willing to work with the administration to approve TPA as soon as possible.
I believe the bipartisan bill Chairman Baucus and I recently introduced to renew TPA would receive strong bipartisan support in the Senate if it were allowed to come up for a vote.
Indeed, I am confident that the vast majority of my colleagues would join me in supporting the bill.
The problem is, Republicans are not in the majority in the Senate.  It is the Democrats that control the agenda.   And, unfortunately, the President’s call to renew TPA does not appear to be a priority for them.",3049.0,"<h4>GOP senate means largest expansion of trade ever via fastrack</h4><p><strong>HATCH 14 Finance Committee Ranking Member – Senator</strong> [Orrin Hatch, Julia Lawless, Antonia Ferrier, Hatch Pushes for Senate Action on Bill to Help Boost Job-Creating Trade Pacts, http://www.finance.senate.gov/newsroom/ranking/release/?id=12ab52b7-8688-4e23-9055-0c34f7c55106<u>]</p><p>Why is TPA so important?</p><p></u>I think some additional context is necessary here.</p><p><u><mark>The</mark> <mark>administration</mark> <mark>is</u></mark> currently <u><mark>in</u></mark> the midst of <u><mark>negotiations on the</u></mark> Trans-Pacific Partnership, or <u><mark>TPP</u></mark>, an Asia-Pacific trade agreement that is currently being negotiated between the United States <u>and twelve other countries</u>, including some of the world’s largest economies, such as Japan, Canada, and Mexico.</p><p>The Asia-Pacific region represents <u><mark>more than forty percent of the world’s trade</mark>.</u>  And, as a group, TPP countries represent the largest goods and services export market for the United States. </p><p>On the other side of the world, <u>the U.S. is negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the</u> twenty-eight countries of the <u>European Union. </p><p></u>The United States and the EU <u>generate <mark>over half of the world’s economic output</mark>.</p><p></u>Total goods trade alone between the U.S. and EU amounts to <u>over one trillion </u>dollars<u> a year</u>. </p><p>Investment flows represent another three-hundred billion dollars a year.</p><p>Together, <u>these</u> two <u>trade agreements have the potential to greatly expand access for U.S. products</u> into foreign markets around the world.

In 2008, the APHA, the nation’s largest public health association, adopted a policy supporting aid in dying.

Fettweis ‘7 (Christopher Fettweis, Asst Prof Poli Sci – Tulane, Asst Prof National Security Affairs – US Naval War College, “On the Consequences of Failure in Iraq,” Survival, Vol. 49, Iss. 4, December, p. 83 – 98)
Without the US presence, a second argument goes, nothing would prevent Sunni-Shia violence from sweeping into every country where the religious divide exists. A Sunni bloc with centres in Riyadh and Cairo might face a Shia bloc headquartered in Tehran, both of which would face enormous pressure from their own people to fight proxy wars across the region. In addition to intra-Muslim civil war, cross-border warfare could not be ruled out. Jordan might be the first to send troops into Iraq to secure its own border; once the dam breaks, Iran, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia might follow suit. The Middle East has no shortage of rivalries, any of which might descend into direct conflict after a destabilising US withdrawal. In the worst case, Iran might emerge as the regional hegemon, able to bully and blackmail its neighbours with its new nuclear arsenal. Saudi Arabia and Egypt would soon demand suitable deterrents of their own, and a nuclear arms race would envelop the region. Once again, however, none of these outcomes is particularly likely.¶ Wider war¶ No matter what the outcome in Iraq, the region is not likely to devolve into chaos. Although it might seem counter-intuitive, by most traditional measures the Middle East is very stable. Continuous, uninterrupted governance is the norm, not the exception; most Middle East regimes have been in power for decades. Its monarchies, from Morocco to Jordan to every Gulf state, have generally been in power since these countries gained independence. In Egypt Hosni Mubarak has ruled for almost three decades, and Muammar Gadhafi in Libya for almost four. The region's autocrats have been more likely to die quiet, natural deaths than meet the hangman or post-coup firing squads. Saddam's rather unpredictable regime, which attacked its neighbours twice, was one of the few exceptions to this pattern of stability, and he met an end unusual for the modern Middle East. Its regimes have survived potentially destabilising shocks before, and they would be likely to do so again.¶ The region actually experiences very little cross-border warfare, and even less since the end of the Cold War. Saddam again provided an exception, as did the Israelis, with their adventures in Lebanon. Israel fought four wars with neighbouring states in the first 25 years of its existence, but none in the 34 years since. Vicious civil wars that once engulfed Lebanon and Algeria have gone quiet, and its ethnic conflicts do not make the region particularly unique.¶",2971.0,"<h4>No Middle East war -- US Security umbrella solves.</h4><p>No Middle East War -- </p><p>One -- US Security Umbrella -- it contains rivalries from developing and promotes a stable Middle East because of the deterrence commitment.</p><p>Two -- Stability now -- regimes have remained uninterrupted for decades and civil wars have rapidly declined.</p><p><strong>Fettweis ‘7 </strong>(Christopher Fettweis, Asst Prof Poli Sci – Tulane, Asst Prof National Security Affairs – US Naval War College, “On the Consequences of Failure in Iraq,” Survival, Vol. 49, Iss. 4, December, p. 83 – 98) </p><p><u><strong><mark>Without</mark> the <mark>US presence</mark>, </u></strong>a second argument goes, <u><strong><mark>nothing would prevent</u></strong></mark> Sunni-Shia <u><strong><mark>violence</u></strong></mark> from sweeping into every country where the religious divide exists. <u>A Sunni bloc</u> with centres in Riyadh and Cairo might face a Shia bloc headquartered in Tehran, both of which <u>would</u> face enormous pressure from their own people to <u>fight proxy wars</u> across the region. <u>In addition to intra-Muslim civil war, cross-border warfare could not be ruled out.</u> Jordan might be the first to send troops into Iraq to secure its own border; once the dam breaks, Iran, Turkey, Syria and Saudi Arabia might follow suit. <u>The Middle East has no shortage of <mark>rivalries</u></mark>, any of <u><strong>which <mark>might descend</mark> into direct conflict <mark>after a destabilising US withdrawal</mark>.</u></strong> In the worst case, Iran might emerge as the regional hegemon, able to bully and blackmail its neighbours with its new nuclear arsenal.

After all, the rhetoric of competitiveness -- the view that, in the words of President Clinton, each nation is ""like a big corporation competing in the global marketplace"" -- has become pervasive among opinion leaders throughout the world. People who believe themselves to be sophisticated about the subject take it for granted that the economic problem facing any modern nation is essentially one of competing on world markets -- that the United States and Japan are competitors in the same sense that Coca-Cola competes with Pepsi -- and are unaware that anyone might seriously question that proposition. Every few months a new best-seller warns the American public of the dire consequences of losing the ""race"" for the 21st century. A whole industry of councils on competitiveness, ""geo-economists"" and managed trade theorists has sprung up in Washington. Many of these people, having diagnosed America's economic problems in much the same terms as Delors did Europe's, are now in the highest reaches of the Clinton administration formulating economic and trade policy for the United States. So Delors was using a language that was not only convenient but comfortable for him and a wide audience on both sides of the Atlantic.
Unfortunately, his diagnosis was deeply misleading as a guide to what ails Europe, and similar diagnoses in the United States are equally misleading. The idea that a country's economic fortunes are largely determined by its success on world markets is a hypothesis, not a necessary truth; and as a practical, empirical matter, that hypothesis is flatly wrong. That is, it is simply not the case that the world's leading nations are to any important degree in economic competition with each other, or that any of their major economic problems can be attributed to failures to compete on world markets. The growing obsession in most advanced nations with international competitiveness should be seen, not as a well-founded concern, but as a view held in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence. And yet it is clearly a view that people very much want to hold -- a desire to believe that is reflected in a remarkable tendency of those who preach the doctrine of competitiveness to support their case with careless, flawed arithmetic.
This article makes three points. First, it argues that concerns about competitiveness are, as an empirical matter, almost completely unfounded. Second, it tries to explain why defining the economic problem as one of international competition is nonetheless so attractive to so many people. Finally, it argues that the obsession with competitiveness is not only wrong but dangerous, skewing domestic policies and threatening the international economic system.

California utilities are on track to meet the state's current clean energy mandate, which requires them to buy 33 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. In his inaugural address last week, Brown proposed raising that mandate to 50 percent by 2030, as one of several steps to reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
""This is exciting, it is bold and it is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of stopping potentially catastrophic changes to our climate system,"" the Democrat told state lawmakers.
A previous effort to raise the renewable energy mandate above 50 percent — championed by then-Assemblyman V. Manuel Pérez, a Coachella Democrat — died in the state Legislature a year ago. Pérez's bill faced stiff opposition from utilities and businesses groups, who argued that the plan would drive up energy costs.
Now, though, Brown has thrown his substantial influence behind the proposal, coming off a re-election in which he cruised to victory by 20 points.
""With his leadership and commitment, and extensive political capital to spend at this point, I think we're very confident that achieving that outcome is doable,"" said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council's California Climate Program.
The details of Brown's renewable energy plan are still up in the air, and his office declined to offer more specifics.
But an increase in the renewable energy mandate could kick-start solar, wind and geothermal development in the desert, all of which have slowed over the last few years.
""The people putting money into renewable energy need to have a clearer signal that there is going to be a market for renewable energy,"" said Nancy Rader, executive director of the California Wind Energy Association. ""It was great for him to propose that goal.""
Ambitious, but achievable
Energy and climate experts have long assumed that California would raise its renewable energy mandate, officially known as the Renewables Portfolio Standard.
State policymakers have set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and that will be all but impossible without deeper cuts from the electricity sector, which accounts for about one-fifth of all emissions.
From a technical standpoint, energy experts say California should have little difficulty getting 50 percent of its electricity from renewable energy. The state has some of the best solar, wind and geothermal resources in the world, and it also has the option of importing renewable energy from other Western states.

Times of “ crisis provide space for nationalist rhetoric","So how does this discussion of nation-states, nationalism, and global migration relate to “sex trafficking” discourse? I would like to suggest that this discourse provides a timely avenue for nation-states, such as Canada, to reassert their power and privileged identity, both within the nation itself and within the international “world order.” Depictions of “third-world” women as sexually deviant and their “third-world” male abusers as morally corrupt further classify nonnationals as the “other.” Members of the privileged “white” nation are called upon, in such discourse, to take the moral high ground and act as “saviours.” Propagated “sex trafficking” discourse suggests that by supporting tougher immigration controls and increased law enforcement, national members are in fact able to do so. This subsequently helps to reaffirm the importance and power of the nation-state and maintain the status quo.
In considering the vested interests of Canada and the United States, specifically, it is important to consider the impact of September 11th. Times of “national” crisis provide distinct space for nationalist rhetoric by the state, and also for the nation-state’s voice to become more “valid” (Liebner and Weisberg, 2002). Since 9/11, nationalist sentiments declaring the need to protect “national” values, identity, and “way of life” have been prevalent. Of important concern has become “[t]he need to ‘root out’ invisible enemies by identifying who does, and does not, belong to the [national] community…” (Rygiel, 2006, p. 145). This amplified nationalism has not only occurred in the United States post-9/11, but also in Canada. Canadians have come to see identity as a source of security (Rygiel, 2006), and thus have sought to defend it. Therefore in both the United States and Canada, the war on terror has been fought through gendered and racialized notions of citizenship (Rygiel, 200), and as such anti-trafficking sentiments have been complimentary to anti-terrorist sentiments. This has helped to garner support for both the tightening of borders and the differential inclusion of “others” within borders. Since 9/11 the United States has put additional pressure on Canada to tighten its borders through “trafficking in women” discourse. In 2005, in Bill C-49: An Act to Amend the Criminal Code (Trafficking in Persons), the Parliament of Canada noted that:
Canada is recognized as a relatively strong force in terms of the laws and resources in place to combat trafficking. However, a recent US report on trafficking criticized Canada’s limited ability to catch perpetrators, emphasizing that the government must use its laws “vigorously to increase investigations, arrests, prosecutions, and convictions of traffickers, especially those who may be abusing visa waivers and entertainment visas”.
This criticism is arguably rooted in the fact that Canada and the United States share a large frontier.",2923.0,"<h4>The affirmative’s construction of an “evil” unregulated sex market creates nationalistic ordering</h4><p><strong>Burton 12</strong>, Shaunna Bruton is a graduate student of the Gender, Feminist & Women’s Studies program at York University.

Third, legalization has not provided the better working conditions for prostitutes as expected.212 2 Id. Many recent cases of sexual slavery have involved legal brothels. In one case, a group of trafficked Thai women were indentured to pay off debts of 35,000 to 40,000 Australian dollars; they were required to work six to seven days each week, servicing up to 500 buyers. Id. They were kept imprisoned in a squalid hotel, windows barred and shuttered from outside view. Id. For all their work, they never received a dime. Id The problem is that legal prostitution makes it harder to distinguish between women who are forced into prostitution from those who voluntarily chose to become prostitutes, and thus it becomes more challenging for sex-trafficked women to escape the industry and to receive much-needed health and social services as well as to seek justice against their pimps and traffickers.21 3213 Tiefenbrun, Saga, supra note 8, at 147-48.

California utilities are on track to meet the state's current clean energy mandate, which requires them to buy 33 percent of their electricity from renewable sources by 2020. In his inaugural address last week, Brown proposed raising that mandate to 50 percent by 2030, as one of several steps to reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.
""This is exciting, it is bold and it is absolutely necessary if we are to have any chance of stopping potentially catastrophic changes to our climate system,"" the Democrat told state lawmakers.
A previous effort to raise the renewable energy mandate above 50 percent — championed by then-Assemblyman V. Manuel Pérez, a Coachella Democrat — died in the state Legislature a year ago. Pérez's bill faced stiff opposition from utilities and businesses groups, who argued that the plan would drive up energy costs.
Now, though, Brown has thrown his substantial influence behind the proposal, coming off a re-election in which he cruised to victory by 20 points.
""With his leadership and commitment, and extensive political capital to spend at this point, I think we're very confident that achieving that outcome is doable,"" said Alex Jackson, legal director for the Natural Resources Defense Council's California Climate Program.
The details of Brown's renewable energy plan are still up in the air, and his office declined to offer more specifics.
But an increase in the renewable energy mandate could kick-start solar, wind and geothermal development in the desert, all of which have slowed over the last few years.
""The people putting money into renewable energy need to have a clearer signal that there is going to be a market for renewable energy,"" said Nancy Rader, executive director of the California Wind Energy Association. ""It was great for him to propose that goal.""
Ambitious, but achievable
Energy and climate experts have long assumed that California would raise its renewable energy mandate, officially known as the Renewables Portfolio Standard.
State policymakers have set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and that will be all but impossible without deeper cuts from the electricity sector, which accounts for about one-fifth of all emissions.
From a technical standpoint, energy experts say California should have little difficulty getting 50 percent of its electricity from renewable energy. The state has some of the best solar, wind and geothermal resources in the world, and it also has the option of importing renewable energy from other Western states.

The results of legalization depend strongly on the details of the post-prohibition tax and regulatory regimes. In the current situation, continued prohibition might be the worst option. Full commercial legalization on the alcohol model might well be the second-worst. But that is the way we’re heading.
I’m preparing an essay about designing a post-prohibition regime. After the jump is a set of topic sentences and paragraphs for sections of that essay, not yet in a well-defined order.
Substantive comments are welcome. Rant and snark will be ruthlessly zapped.
We probably should legalize cannabis. Prohibition is now breaking down. $35B/yr. is a lot of money to give to criminals, and no one has a plausible plan to shrink the illicit market under prohibition. Even where “medical marijuana” has degenerated into system when anyone can buy a user license from a crooked doctor, the voters still like it. Arguably, prohibition was worth trying. But it’s time to go home.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages. Cannabis legalization will reduce criminal revenue, intrusive enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and disorder around illicit markets, and enhance personal liberty, consumer choice, and respect for the law, and probably reduce bloodshed in Mexico. It might foster safer and more beneficial practices of cannabis use.
Legalization will certainly increase drug abuse, including heavy use by minors. Every adult is a potential source of leakage to minors. And if we insist on making minors consume illicitly-produced pot, we reserve 20-25% of the market for criminals. Much better to tolerate leakage and have a grey-market supply to minors like the current system that provides them with alcohol.
The polarized nature of the debate means that both sides wind up spending lots of time denying the obvious.
Good design tries to get as much of the advantages, and as little of the disadvantages, as possible.
The policies most likely to help control increases in drug abuse are taxation and other efforts to keep prices high, rules about consumer information (labeling and marketing), and “nudge” strategies to enhance consumer mindfulness.
It matters a lot whether, under conditions of legality, cannabis turns out to be a substitute for alcohol or instead a complement. Right now, no one knows the answer, which might not be the same for all parts of the population or the same in the long run as in the short run.
Analysis can help, but there’s no substitute for experience. The trick is not to get locked in to a set of bad policies. We need a process designed to learn from mistakes.

The results of legalization depend strongly on the details of the post-prohibition tax and regulatory regimes. In the current situation, continued prohibition might be the worst option. Full commercial legalization on the alcohol model might well be the second-worst. But that is the way we’re heading.
I’m preparing an essay about designing a post-prohibition regime. After the jump is a set of topic sentences and paragraphs for sections of that essay, not yet in a well-defined order.
Substantive comments are welcome. Rant and snark will be ruthlessly zapped.
We probably should legalize cannabis. Prohibition is now breaking down. $35B/yr. is a lot of money to give to criminals, and no one has a plausible plan to shrink the illicit market under prohibition. Even where “medical marijuana” has degenerated into system when anyone can buy a user license from a crooked doctor, the voters still like it. Arguably, prohibition was worth trying. But it’s time to go home.
Everything has advantages and disadvantages. Cannabis legalization will reduce criminal revenue, intrusive enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and disorder around illicit markets, and enhance personal liberty, consumer choice, and respect for the law, and probably reduce bloodshed in Mexico. It might foster safer and more beneficial practices of cannabis use.
Legalization will certainly increase drug abuse, including heavy use by minors. Every adult is a potential source of leakage to minors. And if we insist on making minors consume illicitly-produced pot, we reserve 20-25% of the market for criminals. Much better to tolerate leakage and have a grey-market supply to minors like the current system that provides them with alcohol.
The polarized nature of the debate means that both sides wind up spending lots of time denying the obvious.
Good design tries to get as much of the advantages, and as little of the disadvantages, as possible.
The policies most likely to help control increases in drug abuse are taxation and other efforts to keep prices high, rules about consumer information (labeling and marketing), and “nudge” strategies to enhance consumer mindfulness.
It matters a lot whether, under conditions of legality, cannabis turns out to be a substitute for alcohol or instead a complement. Right now, no one knows the answer, which might not be the same for all parts of the population or the same in the long run as in the short run.
Analysis can help, but there’s no substitute for experience. The trick is not to get locked in to a set of bad policies. We need a process designed to learn from mistakes.

We must fight","To raise these issues effectively, the movement for nuclear disarmament must overcome its reluctance to speak in terms of power, of institutional racism, and imperialist military terror. The issues of nuclear disarmament and peace have been mystified because they have been placed within a doomsday frame which separates these issues from other ones, saying, ""How can we talk about struggles against racism, poverty, and exploitation when there will be no world after they drop the bombs?"" The struggle for peace cannot be separated from, nor considered more sacrosanct than, other struggles concerned with human life and change.
In April, 1979, the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency released a report on the effects of nuclear war that concludes that, in a general nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, 25 to 100 million people would be killed. This is approximately the same number of African people who died between 1492 and 1890 as a result of the African slave trade to the New World. The same federal report also comments on the destruction of urban housing that would cause massive shortages after a nuclear war, as well as on the crops that would be lost, causing massive food shortages. Of course, for people of color the world over, starvation is already a common problem, when, for example, a nation's crops are grown for export rather than to feed its own people. And the housing of people of color throughout the world's urban areas is already blighted and inhumane: families live in shacks, shanty towns, or on the streets; even in the urban areas of North America, the poor may live without heat or running water.
For people of color, the world as we knew it ended centuries ago. Our world, with its own languages, customs and ways, ended. And we are only now beginning to see with increasing clarity that our task is to reclaim that world, struggle for it, and rebuld it in our own image. The ""death culture"" we live in has convinced many to be more concerned with death than with life, more willing to demonstrate for ""survival at any cost"" than to struggle for liberty and peace with dignity. Nuclear disarmament becomes a safe issue when it is not linked to the daily and historic issues of racism, to the ways in which people of color continue to be murdered. Acts of war, nuclear holocausts, and genocide have already been declared on our jobs, our housing, our schools, our families, and our lands.
As women of color, we are warriors, not pacifists. We must fight as a people on all fronts, or we will continue to die as a people. We have fought in people's wars in China, in Cuba, in Guinea-Bissau, and in such struggles as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, and in countless daily encounters with landlords, welfare departments, and schools.

Where economic means proved insufficient military strategies were tried","The argument that interdependence gives rise to peace is flawed in theory as well as in practice. Conflicts arise from friction, particularly friction involving the fundamental interests of different nations. The less interdependence there is, the fewer the areas of serious friction. The more interdependence there is, the greater the areas of friction, and, therefore, the greater the potential for conflict. Two widely separated nations that trade little with each other are unlikely to go to war—Brazil is unlikely to fight Madagascar precisely because they have so little to do with each other. France and Germany, on the other hand, which have engaged in extensive trade and transnational finance, have fought three wars with each other over about seventy years. Interdependence was the root of the conflicts, not the deterrent. There are, of course, cases of interdependence in which one country effectively absorbs the other or in which their interests match so precisely that the two countries simply merge. In other cases, interdependence remains peaceful because the economic, military, and political power of one country is overwhelming and inevitable. In relations between advanced industrialized countries and third-world countries, for example, this sort of asymmetrical relationship can frequently be seen. All such relationships have a quality of unease built into them, particularly when the level of interdependence is great. When one or both nations attempt, intentionally or unintentionally, to shift the balance of power, the result is often tremendous anxiety and, sometimes, real pain. Each side sees the other’s actions as an attempt to gain advantage and becomes frightened.

These two powers could forgo extreme measures because they were not interdependent. Neither relied on the other for its economic well-being, and therefore, its social stability. This provided considerable room for maneuvering. Because there were few economic linkages, neither nation felt irresistible pressure to bring the relationship under control; neither felt any time constraint. Had one country been dependent on the other for something as important as oil or long-term investment, there would have been enormous fear of being held hostage economically.

They have conferred monopolistic market power on gambling operators.

The national regulator is responsible for licensing gambling operators, and for nationally taxing them. Without regulations banning the placing of bets across the country, the industry has been less restricted in taking bets remotely, and sees the online environment as a natural extension of its interest in expanding commercial opportunities. The industry, as much as the state, supports the regulatory incorporation of online gambling not as a new industry that attacks its interests, but as an enabler of its ability to compete in new markets by enhancing its legitimacy in them.¶ The differing intersection of state and industry interests informed by historical national regulatory contexts has affected the differing regulatory approaches taken. Globally, the result is that the US has passed the regulatory ‘baton’ for legitimising the online gambling industry to the UK, and perhaps other advanced industrialised states. This is because the UK overtly desires to inﬂuence other states’ regulations as much as tempt online gambling providers onshore. The UK desires to extend its national jurisdictional control over the industry wherever possible, rather than excise it from within its borders. In this, the role of the online gambling industry itself is crucial. The largest ﬁrms and associations in the industry, such as Partygaming (2006), applaud the UK’s regulatory framework, and eCOGRA’s CEO declares that ‘it is in the best interests of the industry, which provides employment and revenues worldwide, that it is recognised and regulated by national laws and we want to continue to offer our support for what the UK is doing in this area’ (eCOGRA).

The largest ﬁrms and associations in <u>the industry</u>, such as Partygaming (2006), <u>applaud the UK’s regulatory framework,</u> and eCOGRA’s CEO declares that ‘it is in the best interests of the industry, which provides employment and revenues worldwide, that it is recognised and regulated by national laws and we want to continue to offer our support for what the UK is doing in this area’ (eCOGRA). Such industry support may serve to enlarge the territorial reach of the UK’s regulatory framework.¶ </p>",,,1nc,431331,4,17161,./documents/ndtceda14/Emory/KlLo/Emory-Klarman-Lowe-Neg-Gsu-Round5.docx,565446,N,Gsu,5,Georgetown Erpenbach-Krishnan,Deming,"1ac - online gambling trade and economy

Conflicts arise from friction, particularly friction involving the fundamental interests of different nations. The less interdependence there is, the fewer the areas of serious friction. The more interdependence there is, the greater the areas of friction, and, therefore, the greater the potential for conflict. Two widely separated nations that trade little with each other are unlikely to go to war—Brazil is unlikely to fight Madagascar precisely because they have so little to do with each other. France and Germany, on the other hand, which have engaged in extensive trade and transnational finance, have fought three wars with each other over about seventy years. Interdependence was the root of the conflicts, not the deterrent. There are, of course, cases of interdependence in which one country effectively absorbs the other or in which their interests match so precisely that the two countries simply merge. In other cases, interdependence remains peaceful because the economic, military, and political power of one country is overwhelming and inevitable. In relations between advanced industrialized countries and third-world countries, for example, this sort of asymmetrical relationship can frequently be seen. All such relationships have a quality of unease built into them, particularly when the level of interdependence is great. When one or both nations attempt, intentionally or unintentionally, to shift the balance of power, the result is often tremendous anxiety and, sometimes, real pain. Each side sees the other’s actions as an attempt to gain advantage and becomes frightened. In the end, precisely because the level of interdependence is so great, the relationship can, and frequently does, spiral out of control. Consider the seemingly miraculous ability of the United States and Soviet Union to be rivals and yet avoid open warfare. These two powers could forgo extreme measures because they were not interdependent. Neither relied on the other for its economic well-being, and therefore, its social stability. This provided considerable room for maneuvering. Because there were few economic linkages, neither nation felt irresistible pressure to bring the relationship under control; neither felt any time constraint. Had one country been dependent on the other for something as important as oil or long-term investment, there would have been enormous fear of being held hostage economically. Each would have sought to dominate the relationship, and the result would have been catastrophic. In the years before World War I, as a result of European interdependence, control of key national issues fell into the hands of foreign governments.

If Quebec were to secede from Canada, two unsettling possibilities could occur. The first is that Canada could go to war with its wayward province. The second is that some power like China or Russia could build an alliance with Quebec. While such possibilities are unlikely, there are means of defense.
The Canadian Civil War
If Quebec were to secede from Canada, there are several points that could spark a civil war between the two. The least likely would be national pride. There are several economic reasons that could provide the tinder for war. Quebec controls the mouth of the St. Lawrence River, and Quebec could use that control to wage economic war with Western Canada. In addition, Quebec possesses significant reserves of natural resources that currently contribute to the North American economy on a free basis. An independent Quebec would change that. Finally, Canada proper would become a split country, with a third of Canadian provinces being geographically separated from the Capital. In light of the fact that no state wants to be divided, and Canada already has several fluttering independence movements, the urge to prevent further dissolution will be strong.
While it is true that Canada does not have a large military, and Quebec has none, it is not impossible for war to break out. The Quebec separatists have used violence before, most notably with the murder of Quebec Labour Minister Pierre Laporte, and it would be easy for a semi-independent Quebec to buy arms on the international market.
If Canada did get involved in civil war with Quebec, there are several options open to both sides if the war drags on. Canada could invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty, which could split NATO as France has traditionally expressed support for Francophone Quebec. It is unlikely Britain would be unconcerned with a core Commonwealth state being embroiled in civil war; especially depending on how the vote for Scottish independence goes this year. The United States would be committed, as they are deeply intertwined with Canada at every level.
States like Russia, China, or Iran could use the distraction of a civil war in the very center of the Anglosphere to press their boundaries with the Western Alliance. Furthermore, they could start supporting the Quebec rebels, either directly or through third party means. If the war was presaged by an internationally recognized referendum, then Russia or China could take the position that they are upholding international norms, and paint the Western states in a negative light. Attempts at arming the rebels or openly supporting them would directly threaten the fundamental security of the United States, as it would provide a foothold on the continent from which hostile states could threaten the United States.",2959.0,"<h4>Extinction – causes civil wars, diversionary wars with China, Russia, and Iran and splits NATO. </h4><p><strong>Matthews 14</strong> Daniel S.

Indeed, the only method by which Islamist terrorists have managed to kill anyone in the United States since September 11 has been with gunfire—inflicting a total of perhaps sixteen deaths over the period (cases 4, 26, 32).11 This limited capacity is impressive because, at one time, small-scale terrorists in the United States were quite successful in setting off bombs. Noting that the scale of the September 11 attacks has “tended to obliterate America’s memory of pre-9/11 terrorism,” Brian Jenkins reminds us (and we clearly do need reminding) that the 1970s witnessed sixty to seventy terrorist incidents, mostly bombings, on U.S. soil every year.12 The situation seems scarcely different in Europe and other Western locales. Michael Kenney, who has interviewed dozens of government officials and intelligence agents and analyzed court documents, has found that, in sharp contrast with the boilerplate characterizations favored by the DHS and with the imperatives listed by Dalmia, Islamist militants in those locations are operationally unsophisticated, short on know-how, prone to making mistakes, poor at planning, and limited in their capacity to learn.13 Another study documents the difficulties of network coordination that continually threaten the terrorists’ operational unity, trust, cohesion, and ability to act collectively.14 In addition, although some of the plotters in the cases targeting the United States harbored visions of toppling large buildings, destroying airports, setting off dirty bombs, or bringing down the Brooklyn Bridge (cases 2, 8, 12, 19, 23, 30, 42), all were nothing more than wild fantasies, far beyond the plotters’ capacities however much they may have been encouraged in some instances by FBI operatives.

Terrorist plotters in Los Angeles in 2005 drew up a list of targets that were all within a 20-mile radius of their shared apartment, some of which did not even exist (case 15).
