When the people of Colorado and Washington made history by legalizing marijuana, their vote reverberated around the world — especially in Latin America, where it has given new energy to the struggle to end drug prohibition. Just hours after the election, politicians from across Mexico’s political spectrum demanded that Mexico end the drug war or to legalize marijuana itself. A bill to legally regulate cannabis was introduced into the lower house of congress, while other politicians spoke of holding a national referendum in three years. “The prohibitionist paradigm is a complete failure,” said the bill’s author, Fernando Belaunzaran, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). “All this has done is spur more violence, the business continues … and the country that has paid the highest costs is Mexico.”",1019.0,"<h4><strong>Its predictable - politicians publically advocate a national referendum on legalization</h4><p>Robelo 13 </p><p></strong>Daniel, research coordinator at the Drug Policy Alliance and writer for the Huffington Post, January 10th, “Legalization in US spurs debate throughout Americas”, http://www.westcoastleaf.net/?p=5178, AB </p><p><u><strong><mark>When</mark> the people of <mark>Colorado and Washington</mark> <mark>made history by legalizing marijuana, their vote reverberated around the world</u></strong></mark> — especially in Latin America, where it has given new energy to the struggle to end drug prohibition.

The word ""legalization"" has conflicting meanings. One, intended to sound the theme of this conference, conveys the notion of government regulation permeating some area of human activity. The other-as found, for example, in the phrase ""the legalization of marijuana""-is a near opposite: the process of making legal or permissible that which was previously forbidden, taking government out of that which it had previously controlled. The recent history of government's relationship to the family amply displays both sorts of legalization, both government's intrusion and its withdrawal, and reveals a paradoxical relation between the two-that as government frees people to live their family lives as they choose, people feel no more free, in part because much government involvement is required to facilitate the new freedom.",1010.0,"<h4>Regulation also means you have to defend the <u>PROCESS</u> of making legal within regulation<strong> -- spiking out of midterms is an independent voting issue for the reasons above </h4><p>Chambers 85</p><p></strong>David L, University of Michigan Law School, “The 'Legalization' of the Family: Toward a Policy of Supportive Neutrality”, Journal of Law Reform, 18 U.

Under the policies currently in place worldwide, carbon emissions will grow 46 percent by 2040 from a 2010 baseline, the EIA projected in its biennial International Energy Outlook.
Energy-related emissions will total around 45.5 billion tonnes in 2040, up from a reference level of 31.2 billion tonnes in 2010, said the agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Energy.

One standard objection is that individuals could be “coerced” into selling their organs. But this argument is exactly backwards. To find coercion, look no further than the family situation where one member is an organ match for a sibling or a child, but has serious qualms about taking the risk in question. Now money or in-kind benefits cannot be offered to offset that risk. So the full array of nonstop family pressures can be imposed in order to get the reluctant relative to change his or her mind. But in an open market, the potential of thousands of unrelated donors makes it both impossible and unnecessary to bring subtle pressures to bear on these strangers. Coercion is not an inherent consequence of voluntary exchanges.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Comey discussed how the bureau's pot prohibition was making it harder to find tech savvy recruits when he spoke to the annual White Collar Crime Institute conference Monday.
""I have to hire a great work force to compete with those cyber criminals and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview,"" Comey said.
As a result of this, Comey said the FBI is ""grappling with the question right now"" of whether or not to change its marijuana policy. Currently, the agency will not accept job applicants who have smoked pot at any point within the past three years.
In fact, Comey indicated the bureau is already relaxing its restrictions on marijuana. When one attendee at the conference said one of their friends was discouraged from trying to work at the FBI due to the pot policy, Comey said they ""should go ahead and apply"" in spite of their marijuana smoking.",1058.0,"<h4>Their ev’s from March—squo solved</h4><p><strong>Walker, 14 </strong>(Hunter, “The FBI Can’t Hire Cyber Security Recruits Because They All Smoke Weed” Slate, 5/21, http://www.slate.com/blogs/business_insider/2014/05/21/fbi_director_james_comey_has_trouble_recruiting_it_savvy_workers_because.html)</p><p><u>FBI Director</u> James <u><mark>Comey</u></mark> is starting to think the law enforcement agency's zero tolerance policy on marijuana might be, like, a total bummer.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, Comey <u><mark>discussed how the bureau's pot prohibition was making it harder to find tech savvy recruits</u></mark> when he spoke to the annual White Collar Crime Institute conference Monday.</p><p>""I have to hire a great work force to compete with those cyber criminals and some of those kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview,"" Comey said.</p><p>As a result of this, Comey said the FBI is ""grappling with the question right now"" of whether or not to change its marijuana policy.

The Myth of the Regulated Market
Proponents offer very different models for a market in organs, making it difficult to know precisely what is being advocated.

Others, including a committee of the American Medical Association, endorse a futures market in organs: American Journal of Transplantation they would compensate would-be donors for agreeing to organ removal upon death (24–29). Still others urge a regulated market among living vendors but provide almost no details (1,6,20).
