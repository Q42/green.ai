When the people of Colorado and Washington made history by legalizing marijuana, their vote reverberated around the world — especially in Latin America, where it has given new energy to the struggle to end drug prohibition. Just hours after the election, politicians from across Mexico’s political spectrum demanded that Mexico end the drug war or to legalize marijuana itself. A bill to legally regulate cannabis was introduced into the lower house of congress, while other politicians spoke of holding a national referendum in three years. “The prohibitionist paradigm is a complete failure,” said the bill’s author, Fernando Belaunzaran, of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). “All this has done is spur more violence, the business continues … and the country that has paid the highest costs is Mexico.”",summarize the following text: ,"When the people of Colorado and Washington made history by legalizing marijuana, their vote reverberated around the world A bill to legally regulate cannabis was introduced into the lower house of congress politicians spoke of holding a national referendum in three years"
"The legalization and decriminalization of marijuana cuts down on pot-related arrests, but neither policy solves the massive racial disparities within those arrests, according to a new report from the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice. CJCJ looked at five states — California, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Washington — that have relaxed their marijuana laws in the past five years. Two of those states (Colorado and Washington) completely legalized possession of small amount of marijuana for adults 21 and older, while the rest loosened or repealed criminal penalties for small amounts across all ages. Marijuana-related arrest rates for all races dropped by roughly two-thirds in four of the five states (Washington didn't have available data). But black people were still nearly five times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than other races, even though black and white Americans use drugs and sell them at similar rates.",summarize the following text: ,The legalization and decriminalization of marijuana cuts down on pot-related arrests but neither policy solves the massive racial disparities within those arrests according to a new report from the C J C J CJCJ looked at five states that relaxed their marijuana laws in the past five years Two of those states completely legalized marijuana Marijuana rates for all races dropped But black people were still nearly five times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than other races even though black and white Americans use drugs and sell them at similar rates
"A majority of Americans favor legalizing marijuana and would be motivated to vote if a measure to do so is on the ballot, according to a George Washington University Battleground poll released today. The survey of 1,000 likely voters found 73 percent support allowing marijuana for legal medical purposes, 53 percent favor decriminalization and 68 percent are “more likely” to go to their polling place to weigh in on a ballot. “Marijuana legalization and marijuana decriminalization is at a tipping point” said Celinda Lake, president of Lake Research Partners and one of the two pollsters who conducted the survey. Support crosses party lines, though younger and single voters -- who tend to vote for Democrats -- are more motivated by those issues, she said. Ballot measures on legalizing pot are set for Alaska’s August primary and probably this November in Oregon, according to Allen St. Pierre, the executive director Norml, a Washington-based nonprofit pushing for more access to the drug. Florida will see a decriminalization effort, he said.",summarize the following text: ,"A majority of Americans favor legalizing marijuana and would be motivated to vote 68 percent are “more likely” to go to their polling place to weigh in on a ballot.

The regression results for the unrestricted bivariate VAR-model including one lag are presented in table 5. The main result is that conflict does not explain trade and trade does not explain current level of conflicts. Meaning there is no relationship between past values trade and conflict on current values of the two variables using the sample chosen here. Both variables are only explained by their own past realizations. Furthermore the conflict equation is hardly valid as a model (very low R2 and F-value). The coefficients of the past realizations of conflict on trade and trade on conflict are unusual in magnitude and not significant at all. There is no comparable approach so far in the literature which means we need further research to con_rm these results. Furthermore a longer time pe- riod is needed and maybe more variables for the VAR-model e.g. GDP as a measurement for economic size. A problem with adding more variables to a VAR-system is that it gets less tractable and needs some structure to make useful interpretations of the parameter estimates.,summarize the following text: ,conflict does not explain trade and trade does not explain current level of conflicts Meaning there is no relationship between past values trade and conflict on current values of the two variables Both variables are only explained by their own past realizations. the conflict equation is hardly valid as a model The coefficients of the past realizations of conflict on trade and trade on conflict are unusual in magnitude and not significant at all.
"I approached the problem by placing myself in the role of a money launderer working with a terror organization seeking to move money from the United States to Europe and beyond. On the basis that the activity must remain undetected by law enforcement and counterterrorism authorities as well as the internet poker websites operators and their regulators, I developed a list of constraints. The most limiting was the assumption that internet poker websites were following every law and regulation to the letter and that they employed both automated and human anticollusion systems. I considered a countermeasure that the website might deploy against me and then built a counter-countermeasure to overcome it. I kept escalating the possible countermeasures until, in November 2007, I discovered a counter-countermeasure that neither the poker websites nor their regulators could stop.//// In light of this discovery, I abandoned any notion of helping the legalization effort as I could not in good conscience promote an activity that I knew would eventually be exploited by criminals or terrorists.",summarize the following text: ,"I approached the problem by placing myself in the role of a money launderer working with a terror organization seeking to move money from the United States to Europe and beyond I developed a list of constraints.

"Under this approach, Congress could either repeal the UIGEA or leave it in place. If the UIGEA is repealed, the government, not financial institutions, would assume responsibility for enforcement of the anti-gambling laws.248 If the UIGEA remains, financial institutions would have a clear determination from Congress as to what constitutes illegal Internet gambling.249 As it stands, financial institutions are forced to make this determination on their own accord.250 Thus, whether the UIGEA is repealed or remains in effect, a law explicitly prohibiting all Internet gambling would permit financial institutions to focus more of their resources on their own business activities and cease spending their private funds on law enforcement and law interpretation.251 In this way, a law explicitly prohibiting Internet gambling and amending or repealing the UIGEA would greatly reduce the impending burden that the UIGEA, in its present state, creates for financial institutions.252 Furthermore, express prohibition would likely be more effective in curbing Internet gambling than the UIGEA.253",summarize the following text: ,"If the UIGEA is repealed, the government, not financial institutions, would assume responsibility for enforcement of the anti-gambling laws If the UIGEA remains, financial institutions would have a clear determination from Congress as to what constitutes illegal Internet gambling As it stands, financial institutions are forced to make this determination on their own accord.

"We come here to a striking pitfall of the common arguments for physician-assisted suicide. Once the key premises of that argument are accepted, there will remain no logical way in the future to (1) for long hold the line against euthanasia, to take care of those physically or psycho- logically unable to take their own lives; (2) deny euthanasia to any competent person who requests it for whatever reason, terminal illness or not; and (3) deny euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide to those who suffer but are incompetent, even if they do not request it. I am not saying that such a scenario will in fact take place, but only that the arguments given in favor of euthanasia logically entail the possibility. We can erect legal safeguards and specify required procedures to keep that scenario from coming to pass, but over time they will provide poor protection if the logic of the moral premises on which they are based is fatally flawed. The safeguards will appear arbitrary and flimsy and will invite covert evasion or outright rejection.",summarize the following text: ,"We come to a striking pitfall of the arguments for physician-assisted suicide there will remain no logical way to hold the line against euthanasia take care of those unable to take their own lives deny euthanasia to any person who requests it and deny euthanasia physician-assisted suicide to those who suffer but are incompetent even if they do not request it arguments given in favor of euthanasia logically entail the possibility We can erect legal safeguards and specify required procedures to keep that scenario from coming to pass, but over time they will provide poor protection if the logic of the moral premises on which they are based is fatally flawed.

"U.S. policies have been the subject of more World Trade Organization disputes (119, followed by the EU with 73, then China with 30) and have been found to violate WTO rules more frequently than any other government’s policies. No government is more likely to be out of compliance with a final WTO Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) ruling — or for a longer period — than the U.S. government. To this day, the United States remains out of compliance in cases involving U.S. subsidies to cotton farmers, restrictions on Antigua’s provision of gambling services, country of origin labeling requirements on meat products, the so-called Byrd Amendment, a variety of antidumping measures, and several other issues, some of which were adjudicated more than a decade ago. In some of these cases, U.S. trade partners have either retaliated, or been authorized to retaliate, against U.S. exporters or asset holders, yet the non-compliance continues as though the United States considers itself above the rules.",summarize the following text: ,"U.S. policies have been the subject of more W T O disputes 119 followed by China with 30 and have been found to violate WTO rules more frequently than any other governmen policies No government is more likely to be out of compliance with a final DSB ruling the U S remains out of compliance in cases involving U.S. subsidies to cotton farmers  country of origin labeling requirements on meat products, the so-called Byrd Amendment, a variety of antidumping measures, and several other issues some of which were adjudicated more than a decade ago.

"The UIGEA requires all payment processors to establish policies and procedures to identify and prevent restricted transactions. 31 U.S.C. § 5364. ""Restricted transactions"" are defined as any knowing receipt of funds in connection with unlawful internet gambling by a person engaged in the business of betting or wagering. 31 U.S.C. § 5362(7) & 5363. This requirement, put in place before some states had authorized intrastate internet gaming, resulted in payment processors, including banks and credit card processors, developing systems that would detect and block ""unlawful internet gambling"" transactions. These detection systems included developing and implementing payment codes and procedures to ensure compliance with the UIGEA. As a result, payment processors are now faced with the need to develop new systems that would allow their payment systems to distinguish between lawful and unlawful transactions.",summarize the following text: ,"The UIGEA requirement resulted in payment processors, including banks and credit card processors, developing systems that would detect and block ""unlawful internet gambling"" transactions.

"Prohibited drugs are typically produced in different countries than they are consumed. The consumer countries blame the producer country and often bully or bribe the producer to enforce its drug laws more effectively. The United States takes such a position with Mexico, whose cartels supply a large portion of the marijuana and other illicit drugs that Americans consume. Mexico, on the other hand, attributes its internal violence to the U.S. appetite for Mexico’s drugs. The United States repeatedly pressures other countries to more aggressively punish producers of drugs for export. Indeed, the United States customarily intervenes and objects when any country, even one as small as Jamaica, considers liberalizing its prohibition laws.68 Not only would the creation of legal drug markets throughout the world allow for enormous drug prohibition resources to be spent productively on something else and would reduce international crime, it would also greatly diminish the international blame game and help rid the United States of its reputation as an international bully.69",summarize the following text: ,"Prohibited drugs are produced in different countries The consumer countries blame the producer and bully the producer to enforce its drug laws more effectively The United States takes such a position with Mexico, whose cartels supply a large portion of the marijuana and other illicit drugs that Americans consume Mexico attributes its internal violence to the U.S. appetite for Mexico’s drugs The United States pressures other countries to more aggressively punish producers of drugs for export the United States intervenes and objects when any country considers liberalizing its prohibition laws.

"In “Don’t Follow the Money” (column, Oct. 19), David Brooks argues that because big-spending candidates often lose to lesser-funded challengers, there’s no reason to be concerned about the flood of large donations, many of them secret, flowing into Congressional contests this fall. His analysis fails on two levels. First, it’s clear that money counts in our elections. Since 2000, the average winner in contests for open House seats has outspent the average loser by at least $310,000, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute. In races for open Senate seats, winners outspent losers, on average, in every year except 2002. Far more important than who wins — and not mentioned by Mr. Brooks — is the difference that big contributions make after the election. The individuals, corporations, trade groups and unions writing record-sized checks this fall will want a return on their investments; winning candidates, outspent or not, will have a powerful incentive to provide it. These are building blocks for scandal.",summarize the following text: ,"Brooks argues that because big-spending candidates often lose to lesser-funded challengers His analysis fails on two levels it’s clear that money counts in our elections Since 2000, the average winner in contests for open House seats has outspent the average loser by at least $310,000, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Campaign Finance Institute In races for open Senate seats, winners outspent losers, on average, in every year except 2002.

"Finally, certain sociodemographic characteristics consistently predict support and opposition to euthanasia or PAS.13- 15 Catholics and people who report themselves to be more religious are significantly more opposed to euthanasia or PAS. Similarly, African Americans and older individuals are significantly more opposed to euthanasia or PAS. Finally, some, but not all, surveys suggest that women are significantly more opposed to euthanasia or PAS. Interestingly, patients with terminal illnesses, such as cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, have attitudes that are almost identical to the public's.16 In other words, having a serious, life-threatening illness itself does not seem to alter attitudes toward the permissibility or opposition to euthanasia or PAS. Similarly, being a caregiver for a terminally ill patient or a recently bereaved caregiver does not seem to affect attitudes toward euthanasia or PAS.16",summarize the following text: ,certain characteristics predict support and opposition to PAS people who report themselves to be more religious are significantly more opposed to PAS African Americans and older individuals are significantly more opposed PAS some surveys suggest women are significantly more opposed to PAS
"“Regardless of the votes that Democrats got in the midterms, all the numbers suggest that we’ve got the strongest major economy in the world at this point,” said Ken Lieberthal, top China adviser in the Clinton White House. He added that the election’s impact on the president’s credibility is trivial compared to the U.S. government shutdown last year and threats that the U.S. might default on its debt. Though some Asian officials are likely to be dubious about Obama’s post-midterms stature, experts said sophisticated watchers of the U.S. political scene may actually see Obama as liberated to spend more time focusing on Asia. “The narrative among a lot of elites, including leaders, is that President Obama has the Asian engagement DNA in his blood. It’s what he wants to do,” Ernest Bower of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said. The hope is “he has been sort of hijacked by domestic politics and the elections in the United States and that now he may be able to turn to Asia for legacy issues.”",summarize the following text: ,Regardless of the votes that Democrats got in the midterms all the numbers suggest that we’ve got the strongest major economy in the world at this point the election’s impact on the president’s credibility is trivial compared to the U.S. government shutdown and threats the U.S. might default on its debt The narrative among a lot of leaders is that Obama has the Asian engagement DNA in his blood It’s what he wants to do

The word ""legalization"" has conflicting meanings. One, intended to sound the theme of this conference, conveys the notion of government regulation permeating some area of human activity. The other-as found, for example, in the phrase ""the legalization of marijuana""-is a near opposite: the process of making legal or permissible that which was previously forbidden, taking government out of that which it had previously controlled. The recent history of government's relationship to the family amply displays both sorts of legalization, both government's intrusion and its withdrawal, and reveals a paradoxical relation between the two-that as government frees people to live their family lives as they choose, people feel no more free, in part because much government involvement is required to facilitate the new freedom.",summarize the following text: ,"legalization"" has conflicting meanings One conveys government regulation of human activity.

"Trafficking in women is fueled by poverty, and women in transitioning and developing countries are exceptionally vulnerable.144 Poverty conditions in these countries tend to impact women in particular, as their economic status vis-à-vis men is usually even lower in these countries. While the eradication of gender-based poverty is too large of an agenda to be tackled within an anti-trafficking scheme, the conditions that foster a vulnerability to trafficking must at least be addressed at some point. In both the smuggling and trafficking scenarios, it is crucial to look at the reasons why a person would feel the need to leave her home country and travel abroad in search of work or escape from a violent or unsuitable life, but also to remember that some simply leave home in search of adventure or a better life and find themselves held against their will or forced into labor. Fully understanding the reasons women fall prey to traffickers can help legislators determine how best to draft and implement anti-trafficking legislation.",summarize the following text: ,"Trafficking in women is fueled by poverty, and women in transitioning and developing countries are exceptionally vulnerable Poverty conditions in these countries tend to impact women in particular, as their economic status vis-à-vis men is usually even lower in these countries While the eradication of poverty is too large to be tackled within an anti-trafficking scheme, the conditions that foster a vulnerability to trafficking must be addressed In both the smuggling and trafficking scenarios, it is crucial to look at the reasons why a person would feel the need to leave her home in search of work Fully understanding the reasons women fall prey to traffickers can help legislators determine how best to draft and implement anti-trafficking legislation"

The poor spend up to half their disposable income on edibles, making rapid food inflation a cause of concern for dictators, strongmen, and assorted autocrats everywhere. So even if humankind does not go to war over bad harvests, Paskal may be right when she contends that climate change may end up altering the global map.

A growing tendency is to make use of strategies for spatially segregating prostitution and activities associated with it in order to manage or minimize perceived externalities. This echoes the long-time practice in many cities where overt prostitution is de facto shunted into specific enclaves, often called ""red light districts."" These have usually been ""low-rent"" neighborhoods, that is, low-valued land-use urban zones, in or near ethnic minority or migrants' residential areas. It is illustrative of the spatial logic of minimizing the social costs of prostitution that the only place where it is legally tolerated in the United States are certain rural counties of Nevada—areas with very low population densities whose economic development alternatives include military weapons testing sites and toxic waste dumps.",summarize the following text: ,"ETB]

Exhibition of obscenity and indecent exposure—as well as other criminal sexual activity such as prostitution—are crimes and have been totally banned by the state. Zoning restrictions on sexually oriented businesses can be adopted to minimize the adverse effects these uses may have on surrounding neighborhoods. These businesses can be limited to certain zoning districts and be kept a reasonable distance away from residential areas, places of assembly, and other sensitive land uses. Local governments can require premises for adult uses to be separated from one another so as to prevent an unwholesome concentration of adult businesses. Reasonable regulations can also be adopted to govern the operation of adult businesses to reduce the potential for criminal activity and assure responsible operation.",summarize the following text: ,"A local government concerned about sexually oriented businesses can do several things Zoning restrictions on sexually oriented businesses can be adopted to minimize the adverse effects these uses may have on surrounding neighborhoods.

A problem with adding more variables to a VAR-system is that it gets less tractable and needs some structure to make useful interpretations of the parameter estimates.,summarize the following text: ,conflict does not explain trade and trade does not explain current level of conflicts Meaning there is no relationship between past values trade and conflict on current values of the two variables Both variables are only explained by their own past realizations. the conflict equation is hardly valid as a model The coefficients of the past realizations of conflict on trade and trade on conflict are unusual in magnitude and not significant at all.
"HEADLINE:  Diversity of Oil  Market Helps Cushion Against Price  Shocks:  BP    World oil supply is becoming ""more diverse,"" while global production capacity ""comfortably exceeds"" demand, BP's chief economist, Peter Davies, said Tuesday in London, at the launch of the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2003.The underlying factors for the trend include a significant 1.45 million barrel per day increase in non-Opec oil output last year, coupled with largely flat demand growth. The exception was China, which accounted for all of the increase in oil demand last year, and 68.5% of the rise in global primary energy consumption. As a result, Davies said oil markets proved resilient and flexible, with current structures able to maintain oil supplies without excessive price spikes  during the Iraqwar and unexpected disruptions. ""Producers were able to meet the  needs of oil consumers during the Iraqwar and during unplanned supply disruptions in Venezuelaand Nigeria. Consuming nations were not required to tap  their emergency reserves,"" he said.",summarize the following text: ,"World oil supply is becoming ""more diverse,"" BP's chief economist, Davies, said As a result oil markets proved resilient and flexible, with current structures able to maintain oil supplies without excessive price spikes  during unexpected disruptions."

The administration has become a prisoner to the newly emergent threats that it faces. It is therefore encouraging to see the emergence of a new strategic discussion within the United States that recognizes the fact that nonstate actors such as al Qaeda ""do not pose an existential threat"" to the United States. 4 Al Qaeda rejects the expansion of U.S. values, especially in the Middle East, and has proven that it can inflict enormous pain on the United States and its friends and allies and disrupt regions and the globe through terrorist attacks. Yet, it possesses neither the strategic vision nor the capability to topple the existing world order and U.S. predominance. Overreactions based on the overestimation of such threats were the fundamental reasons underlying the failure of the current U.S. strategy.

A growing tendency is to make use of strategies for spatially segregating prostitution and activities associated with it in order to manage or minimize perceived externalities. This echoes the long-time practice in many cities where overt prostitution is de facto shunted into specific enclaves, often called ""red light districts."" These have usually been ""low-rent"" neighborhoods, that is, low-valued land-use urban zones, in or near ethnic minority or migrants' residential areas. It is illustrative of the spatial logic of minimizing the social costs of prostitution that the only place where it is legally tolerated in the United States are certain rural counties of Nevada—areas with very low population densities whose economic development alternatives include military weapons testing sites and toxic waste dumps.",summarize the following text: ,"ETB]

Exhibition of obscenity and indecent exposure—as well as other criminal sexual activity such as prostitution—are crimes and have been totally banned by the state. Zoning restrictions on sexually oriented businesses can be adopted to minimize the adverse effects these uses may have on surrounding neighborhoods. These businesses can be limited to certain zoning districts and be kept a reasonable distance away from residential areas, places of assembly, and other sensitive land uses. Local governments can require premises for adult uses to be separated from one another so as to prevent an unwholesome concentration of adult businesses.

"Similarly, the UW-M study concluded that hemp production “is not likely to generate sizeable profits” and although hemp may be “slightly more profitable than traditional row crops” it is likely “less profitable than other specialty crops” due to the “current state of harvesting and processing technologies, which are quite labor intensive, and result in relatively high per unit costs.”26 The study highlights that U.S. hemp growers could be affected by competition from other world producers as well as by certain production limitations in the United States, including yield variability and lack of harvesting innovations and processing facilities in the United States, as well as difficulty transporting bulk hemp. The study further claims that most estimates of profitability from hemp production are highly speculative, and often do not include additional costs of growing hemp in a regulated market, such as the cost associated with “licensing, monitoring, and verification of commercial hemp.”27",summarize the following text: ,"the study conclude hemp production “is not likely to generate sizeable profits” and although hemp may be “slightly more profitable than traditional row crops” it is less profitable than other specialty crops” due to the “current state of harvesting and processing technologies, which are  labor intensive, and result in high per unit costs U.S. hemp growers could be affected by competition from other world producers as well as production limitations in the U S including yield variability and lack of harvesting innovations and processing facilities as well as difficulty transporting bulk hemp. estimates of profitability from hemp production are highly speculative, and do not include additional costs of growing hemp in a regulated market, such as cost associated with “licensing, monitoring, and verification of commercial hemp"

""Support for legalization, though growing markedly"", they write, ""is not as intense as opposition, and is likely to remain relatively shallow so long as marijuana itself is not seen as a positive good."" The trend in favour of legal weed, they observe, is not as inexorable as the trend toward the legal recognition of same-sex marriages. Much of the support for legalisation comes from the increasingly widespread belief that the benefits of prohibition have not outweighed the costs.

The first is about invented scarcities and artificial needs within a new context of highly fetishized ‘fresh’ organs. The scarcity of cadaver organs has evolved into an active trade in ‘surplus’ organs from living ‘ suppliers’ as well as in new forms of ‘biopiracy’. The second point concerns the transplant rhetoric of altruism masking real demands for human sacrifice. The third point concerns surplus empathy and the relative visibility of two distinct populations – excluded and invisible organ givers and included and highly visible organ receivers.

"Sex trafficking and prostitution are extremely similar, except in rare cases where someone willingly chooses to pimp him or herself to clients for money. The reality is that over 90% of prostituted persons do not want to be involved in prostitution but feel that they are trapped by their pimps or their dire financial situation. Sex trafficked persons are not willing to prostitute themselves and have been either forced or manipulated into prostitution. It is also important to note that all prostituted minors are automatically defined by the U.S. Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) as victims of sex trafficking. In cases of both sex trafficking and prostitution, pimps and traffickers often have control over the prostituted person in terms of movement, eating habits, earned income, fashion, and social life.

First, right now rich people can influence the UNOS allocation process to work their way up the queue. Richer people have more contacts and more resources to spend on getting themselves on, if necessary, multiple queues. Worse still, there are all sorts of opportunities to divert cadaveric organs to favored recipients, as major transplant centers can keep harvested organs for their own patients by claiming that their condition renders them unfit to be transferred elsewhere.

So why not take the plunge? One standard objection is that individuals could be “coerced” into selling their organs. But this argument is exactly backwards. To find coercion, look no further than the family situation where one member is an organ match for a sibling or a child, but has serious qualms about taking the risk in question. Now money or in-kind benefits cannot be offered to offset that risk. So the full array of nonstop family pressures can be imposed in order to get the reluctant relative to change his or her mind. But in an open market, the potential of thousands of unrelated donors makes it both impossible and unnecessary to bring subtle pressures to bear on these strangers.

"The US-Antigua Gambling case, which has pitted one of the WTO’s tiniest economies against its biggest, is seen as a test of whether the global trade body's dispute settlement system is equitable and fair. Such “fairness” will depend in some part, on how successful Antigua is with its threat to implement the cross retaliation authorization.
Whilst the notion of IP “cross-retaliation” has been doing the rounds for a while, there is considerable uncertainty regarding how this concept will be operationalized and implemented. Developing countries urgently need to work out an optimal model that helps assess losses to the foreign IP owner in a reasonably objective way—this way there is no time lost between the procuring of a favorable order from the WTO sanctioning cross-retaliation and the actual crossretaliation itself. The lack of a credible domestic model has no doubt caused Antigua’s threat of cross retaliation to be taken less seriously by the US.",summarize the following text: ,"The US-Antigua Gambling case is seen as a test of whether the global trade body's dispute settlement system is equitable and fair Such “fairness” will depend on how successful Antigua is with its threat to implement the cross retaliation authorization

"The second view of China’s ambitions is that they are far-reaching. The examples of nazi Germany, Imperial Japan and stalinist Russia lead some to assume that any rising power must inevitably aim to overturn every aspect of the preexisting order—territorial, economic, political, ideological, even moral. many people fear that China too has these ambitions. but this fear underestimates China’s immense stake in many aspects of the current order of which it has been by far the biggest beneficiary. In this way, it is very unlike the disruptive rising powers of the 20th century—there is no evidence that China has territorial ambitions, notwithstanding its assertiveness in the south China sea. It has no political or ideological agendas, and no reason to change the economic order. In fact, China seems to want to change very little about the global or regional order except its own role in it, and even there its leadership ambitions seem primarily limited to Asia.",summarize the following text: ,"any rising power must inevitably aim to overturn the preexisting order many people fear that China too has these ambitions but this fear underestimates China’s immense stake in many aspects of the current order of which it has been by far the biggest beneficiary. it is very unlike the disruptive rising powers of the 20th century there is no evidence that China has territorial ambitions It has no political or ideological agendas, and no reason to change the economic order.

"All these policy practices were interpreted by the implementing countries as respecting the confines of treaty latitude. Most have a solid legal basis, others employ a certain legal creativity, not always acknowledged by the INCB. And sometimes schemes perfectly justifiable in principle have been applied with a “pragmatic” dose of hypocrisy.

"It's important, first of all, to understand that neither of these options has anything to do with ""legalization."" Legalizing a drug removes the prohibition on its production, sale or consumption, albeit with government regulation. Uruguay is the only nation to have recently approved legislation to legalize marijuana, which will allow the government to control most of the stages from production to consumption. Colorado and Washington are the only U.S. states to have legalized the recreational use of marijuana; possession and sale for medical purposes is permitted in 20 other states. However, marijuana remains on the U.S. federal government's list of ""controlled substances"" as an illegal narcotic. Even though the U.S. Department of Justice has indicated it is reconsidering whether it will enforce federal penalties, marijuana legalization still violates UN drug treaties, primarily the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.",summarize the following text: ,"marijuana remains on the U.S. federal government's list of ""controlled substances"" as an illegal narcotic marijuana legalization violates UN drug treaties, primarily the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs."
"The reasons for the lack of organ donors may often be due to the donation system which exists within a country; Johnson and Goldstein note that when opt-in donation systems are present: donation rates can be as low as 4.25% of the population, as in Denmark; conversely donation rates for opt-out systems average around 98%, a trend demonstrated in countries such as France, Austria and Portugal. Cultural differences appear to have an impact on donation, New Mexico Donor Services 2003 report states that the Roma people are opposed to the donation of organs, a tentative link may be made between their high concentration in Eastern Europe and those countries’ low donation rates (New Mexico Donor Services). The Japan Organ Transplant Network argues that the scandal and corruption surrounding the country’s first heart transplant operation has lead to a national mindset of distrust (Japan Organ Transplant Network). This has been substituted for the crippling lifestyle disease rates that have caused organ shortages in the western world.",summarize the following text: ,"Johnson and Goldstein note that when opt-in donation systems are present: donation rates can be as low as 4.25% of the population, conversely donation rates for opt-out systems average around 98%, a trend demonstrated in countries such as France, Austria and Portugal"
"There have been several attempts to explain why this occurs. One commentator has suggested that this outcome is a result of psychological factors.  n150 He suggests that individuals may have negative feelings towards organ procurement because of its relationship with death and that these feelings impact the legal systems designed to encourage donation.  n151 Emotional issues involved may deter the decedent's family from agreeing to donation, as well as prevent health care professionals from feeling comfortable enough to sensitively request donation from the family.  n152 Therefore, he proposes that the solution to the organ shortage lies in addressing the psychological issues involved in procurement rather than adopting more restrictive legal regimes, like presumed consent.  n153 This solution could be accomplished by educating health providers about the need to ask families for consent and by providing training that allows them to do so in a manner that respects the family's grieving,  n154 These measures alone, he argues, would significantly increase the number of organ donors.",summarize the following text: ,"One commentator proposes that the solution to the organ shortage lies in addressing the psychological issues involved in procurement rather than adopting more restrictive legal regimes, This solution could be accomplished by educating health providers about the need to ask families for consent and by providing training that allows them to do so in a manner that respects the family's grieving, These measures alone, he argues, would significantly increase the number of organ donors."
"The Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel would likely expand into the cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine networks. Several experts agree that if marijuana were no longer a profitable enterprise for the Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel they would shift towards trafficking in other profitable drugs.126 What is less clear, however, is how this type of transition would affect violence. As mentioned earlier in this paper, the Gulf Cartel, La Familia, and the Juarez cartel are already heavily committed to the cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine industries to various extents. These other DTOs might respond violently to any attempts by the Sinaloa cartel or Tijuana cartel to take any of their shares of the trafficking market. Given that its revenue streams were disrupted, there is also the possibility that the Sinaloa cartel would make a deal with its allies, the Gulf Cartel and La Familia, rather than fight them. The implications of this are unclear. If this occurs then the legalization of marijuana will have brought few security dividends.",summarize the following text: ,"The Sinaloa cartel and Tijuana cartel would likely expand into the cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine networks the Gulf Cartel, La Familia, and the Juarez cartel are already heavily committed to  cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine These other DTOs might respond violently to any attempts by the Sinaloa cartel or Tijuana cartel to take any of their shares of the trafficking market there is also the possibility that the Sinaloa cartel would make a deal with its allies rather than fight them The implications of this are unclear If this occurs then the legalization of marijuana will have brought few security dividends."
"Organ-donation groups are rightly thrilled with Facebook’s initiative. Yet it’s important to keep the larger picture in mind. Even if every American agreed to be an organ donor, there still wouldn’t be enough kidneys for transplantation.

Now look more closely at the donor math: Of the roughly 2 million Americans who die annually, it has been estimated that only 10,500 to 13,000 possess organs healthy enough for transplanting. So, if every eligible person donated his organs at death, surgeons might be able to double the number of transplant surgeries.

Carmat, the company that engineered the artificial heart, intended their product for terminally ill patients like him who are too old to have any chance of receiving a human heart. Without the implant, the French patient may have lived for a few more days or possibly weeks—if lucky. Since he was the first person to be fitted with the artificial novelty, the operation would have been considered a success if he had lived for another month. With the Carmat’s artificial heart, this patient lived for another two and a half months before passing away in March 2014.

"Obama also said he would stay engaged with Congress as they debate his decision to relax the embargo against Cuba.

Asked about the Keystone XL pipeline, a controversial proposal to build a connector from Canada to the Gulf Coast, Obama offered his most negative comments on the pipeline to date. He said the pipeline wouldn’t actually help Americans seeking lower-priced gasoline, but would help only the Canadians. He didn't explicitly promise to veto the pipeline, but his tone more than hinted that he would. Obama’s growing opposition to Keystone won’t have to wait long to play out. Sen.

"While it has become fashionable to characterize the current world order as one of extensive globalization and suggest that peace should follow, an earlier period dating from the middle of the nineteenth century until 1914 stands out as the Achilles' heel of liberal international relations theory. Then, as now, the world economy was marked by dramatic integration in goods, capital, and labor markets. For example, British and French exports grew by respective factors of thirty-five and twenty-five between 1820 and 1913. French, German, and American exports all expanded over 30 percent in the three years before 1914. British capital exports were nearly nine percent of the gross domestic product (gdp) in 1911—a ratio unmatched even in the current wave of globalization. If expanding economic ties bind states together in a commercial web that either makes war unthinkable or simply raises its costs to unacceptable levels, then why did this earlier era of globalization fail to prevent one of the defining conflicts of modern history—the outbreak of World War I?",summarize the following text: ,"an earlier period dating from the middle of the nineteenth century until 1914 stands out as the Achilles' heel of liberal international relations theory.

"As we have already emphasized, increasing levels of trade between an autocratic and democratic country are unlikely to constrain the former from initiating militarized disputes against the latter. As depicted in Figure 1, our analysis indicates that an increase in trade dependence by an autocratic challenger on a democratic target from zero to 5% of the former's GDP would increase the probability of the challenger’s dispute initiation from about 0.31% to 0.29%. Thus, the overall probability of dispute initiation by an autocratic country against a democracy is fairly high (given the rarity of disputes) at 23 nearly .3% per country per year. Moreover, increased trade does little or nothing to alter that risk. Increases in trade dependence also have little effect on the likelihood that one autocracy will initiate a conflict with another. In this instance, the probability of dispute initiation remains constant at 0.33% regardless of the challenger’s level of trade dependence.",summarize the following text: ,"As we have already emphasized, increasing levels of trade between an autocratic and democratic country are unlikely to constrain the former from initiating militarized disputes against the latter increased trade does little or nothing to alter that risk.

"As we have already emphasized, increasing levels of trade between an autocratic and democratic country are unlikely to constrain the former from initiating militarized disputes against the latter. As depicted in Figure 1, our analysis indicates that an increase in trade dependence by an autocratic challenger on a democratic target from zero to 5% of the former's GDP would increase the probability of the challenger’s dispute initiation from about 0.31% to 0.29%. Thus, the overall probability of dispute initiation by an autocratic country against a democracy is fairly high (given the rarity of disputes) at 23 nearly .3% per country per year. Moreover, increased trade does little or nothing to alter that risk. Increases in trade dependence also have little effect on the likelihood that one autocracy will initiate a conflict with another. In this instance, the probability of dispute initiation remains constant at 0.33% regardless of the challenger’s level of trade dependence.",summarize the following text: ,"As we have already emphasized, increasing levels of trade between an autocratic and democratic country are unlikely to constrain the former from initiating militarized disputes against the latter increased trade does little or nothing to alter that risk.

"The second view of China’s ambitions is that they are far-reaching. The examples of nazi Germany, Imperial Japan and stalinist Russia lead some to assume that any rising power must inevitably aim to overturn every aspect of the preexisting order—territorial, economic, political, ideological, even moral. many people fear that China too has these ambitions. but this fear underestimates China’s immense stake in many aspects of the current order of which it has been by far the biggest beneficiary. In this way, it is very unlike the disruptive rising powers of the 20th century—there is no evidence that China has territorial ambitions, notwithstanding its assertiveness in the south China sea. It has no political or ideological agendas, and no reason to change the economic order.

At the same time, consumers have gradually improved their own balance sheets by spending less and paying off more of their debt.",summarize the following text: ,"even if we enter another recession it won’t be nearly as damaging as 08 it wouldn’t be as severe and would also be shorter,” says senior economist at Moody’s a lot of the imbalances that drove the previous recession have been corrected.” banks are better capitalized the housing market has shed delinquent homeowners and corporations are sitting on ample cash reserves to weather another storm."

Once the key premises of that argument are accepted, there will remain no logical way in the future to (1) for long hold the line against euthanasia, to take care of those physically or psycho- logically unable to take their own lives; (2) deny euthanasia to any competent person who requests it for whatever reason, terminal illness or not; and (3) deny euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide to those who suffer but are incompetent, even if they do not request it. I am not saying that such a scenario will in fact take place, but only that the arguments given in favor of euthanasia logically entail the possibility. We can erect legal safeguards and specify required procedures to keep that scenario from coming to pass, but over time they will provide poor protection if the logic of the moral premises on which they are based is fatally flawed.

"We are about to propose a possible commercial scheme, but ﬁrst let us draw a distinction between human biological materials. For reasons which will become apparent below we divide these materials into two classes according to the use to which they are to be put: (i) those which are to be used for therapeutic purposes; and (ii) those which are to be utilized in research. In very general terms, this approximates to the distinction between organs and tissues/ cells respectively. An organ is an aggregation of tissues constituting a structural unit with a particular function or functions. A tissue is a collection of cells, again with a speciﬁc function. Whilst John Moore’s spleen was removed as part of his therapy for hairy cell leukaemia, it was the tissues and cells of his spleen which were used in the derivation of the Mo cell line (Erin 1994).

A second objection is that the voluntary market will discriminate against the poor who do not have the means to pay. To this point, two responses are in order. First, right now rich people can influence the UNOS allocation process to work their way up the queue. Richer people have more contacts and more resources to spend on getting themselves on, if necessary, multiple queues. Worse still, there are all sorts of opportunities to divert cadaveric organs to favored recipients, as major transplant centers can keep harvested organs for their own patients by claiming that their condition renders them unfit to be transferred elsewhere. No system that allocates huge benefits for zero or below market price will be immune from influence, whether we are talking about rent-controlled units in Manhattan or unassigned kidney organs, whose donor, often young and poor, receives not one cent from the successful transfer.",summarize the following text: ,"A objection is that the voluntary market will discriminate against the poor who do not have the means to pay.

Others, including a committee of the American Medical Association, endorse a futures market in organs: American Journal of Transplantation they would compensate would-be donors for agreeing to organ removal upon death (24–29). Still others urge a regulated market among living vendors but provide almost no details (1,6,20). Mostly everyone rejects a public auction with the kidney going to the highest bidder; the preference is for distribution by a central, UNOS-like organization, permitting individuals to sell but not to purchase an organ (30–32).

Others, including a committee of the American Medical Association, endorse a futures market in organs: American Journal of Transplantation they would compensate would-be donors for agreeing to organ removal upon death (24–29). Still others urge a regulated market among living vendors but provide almost no details (1,6,20). Mostly everyone rejects a public auction with the kidney going to the highest bidder; the preference is for distribution by a central, UNOS-like organization, permitting individuals to sell but not to purchase an organ (30–32). Such compromises, it should be noted, are inconsistent with proponents’ attachment to the market. After all, people are even more likely to do something if they are very well paid for it—so why not permit auctions?",summarize the following text: ,"Mostly everyone rejects a public auction with the kidney going to the highest bidder; the preference is for distribution by a central, UNOS-like organization, permitting individuals to sell but not to purchase an organ"
"It is still clear, however, that the economics of Transition – and the level of future US and  other donor military and civilian aid efforts  – are critical if  Afghanistan  is to have a  chance of creating a reasonable level of post-2014 security and stability. It is also  important to remember – for all the problems involved in creating any form of successful ransition  – that the  various insurgent groups still represent relatively small, unpopular  movements with ethnic and sectarian ties that limit their influence in many parts of the  country.  Even if the US and its allies cannot achieve the level of post-2014 stability and security  they desire, this does not mean that Afghanistan cannot achieve relative stability based on  some form of de facto federalism or sharing of power between the  central government  and given factions. This may limit insurgent gains and control as well as mitigate the risk that Afghanistan will become a center of terrorism.",summarize the following text: ,"insurgent groups represent small, unpopular  movements with ethnic and sectarian ties that limit their influence Even if the US and allies cannot achieve the level of stability they desire, this does not mean Afghanistan cannot achieve relative stability based on  some form of de facto federalism between the government  and given factions.
